user_24;user_2414.jpg;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. - Desmond Tutu 🖤  This year has been extremely challenging. A lot of global issues have re-arisen. Global Warming, Plastic Pollution: Floods, droughts, bushfires, pandemics, systemic racism and inequality.  This week has been very eye opening for myself especially. As much as it’s about the system and can feel so much higher than our own power, we can do something and something is better than nothing 🤷🏼‍♀️. It’s important to be accountable for our own actions. So.. What have I done?  I’ve been using this platform to share pieces of information that resonate with me (saved to a highlight). Yesterday, protests were held across Australia, I decided not to attend for the health & safety of my baby. Instead I donated, signed petitions and watched documentaries. I’ve had conversations with others as well as with myself about my own prejudices. I have reflected on how I can teach my future children because racism starts in the home.  I have a lot of thoughts but I’m honestly struggling to put them into words (maybe it’s baby brain 🤣) so I’ve shared some other peoples thoughts that have resonated with me, as well as some Indigenous Australia artists that are AMAZING and I would like to support. Also listing a handful of resources below.  What can you do? * Educate yourself (documentaries, movies, books, podcasts) * Donate money to causes supporting POC - see highlight for posts with directions on where to donate both overseas and in Australia. * Have conversations with family and friends. * Teach your children. * Purchase directly from BIPOC (art, fashion, books etc) * Advocate for what you believe in, & if possible, attend protests.  5 things to watch on Netflix: 1. 13th 2. Explained, the Racial Wealth Gap 3. Time: The Kalief Browder Story (next on my list!) 4. When They See Us 5. Who Killed Malcom X  5 movies to watch: 1. The Green Book 2. 12 Years a Slave 3. Just Mercy 4. Hidden Figures 5. Rabbit Proof Fence (Australian) 🖤 If there has been something you have seen this week that moved you please share in the comments. #blacklivesmatter

user_24;user_2416.jpg;In birth preparation I’ve been doing a lot of visualisations of places that make me feel happy and relaxed, this definitely counts as one of those 😌 maybe I’ll have a water birth and imagine myself right here in this moment 🥰 I’ve also been watching a lot of empowering birth videos and tonight even tuned into a live water birth. Wow so incredibly powerful to witness something to deeply personal and beautiful 😍 thank you @emmaisaacs for sharing tonight 🥺♥️

user_24;user_2420.jpg;Fields of Hemp 🌿 wouldn’t you love to visit something so beautiful ? 😍 Hemp is one of my favourite plant based protein sources.

user_24;user_2422.jpg;34 weeks of sprouting this little chickpea 🌱 it seriously feels like the last few months have disappeared, and these final 6 weeks (give or take) are going to pass by before we know it, and then our whole world will be different forever 🥰 Honestly, I’ve loved being pregnant so far, I feel like I’m going to miss it, while I’m also excited to fit into some jeans and high waisted pants again. #pregnantbelly #34weeks

user_24;user_2454.jpg;25 week bumpdate 🤰🏼 this week has been a bit of a roller coaster of emotions for me 🥺 balancing being a source of inspiration and positivity for my followers and also my own emotions about my first pregnancy during this turbulent time in the world.  I wanna be totally #real with you guys about how I’ve been feeling. I lay out in the sun today and cried into a towel. It felt good to let it out, it’s perfectly ok to feel upset some days... I’ve been hit with a few heartbreaking challenges this week. Cancelled face-face birthing classes and courses, no baby moon, no baby shower, no hospital visitors during the birth experience (except fingers crossed husbands!), border closures in Australia and between states meaning I might not even have my sister able to come in from overseas, or parents visit from interstate, and then I read about possibly not having any visitors to our newborn for the first 8 weeks, or being rushed home from the hospital without face-face follow up appointments on breastfeeding.  I know that it’s changing every day and this may not be the case for us come July, but if we don’t flatten the curve now it may be even worse, who knows, it’s confusing AF 🤷🏼‍♀️😪 I feel guilty for even feeling these feelings since so many people around me have had to cancel weddings, lost jobs or are separated from their loved ones.  First pregnancy is a confusing time, trying to navigate this new journey with so many questions and emotions. It’s also a very exciting time... and I am so grateful for the smiles and happiness I feel each time I feel a kick, each time Alex gets to feel a kick, or when I see my belly popping out of my clothes in the mirror.  Shoutout to all the new mum’s-to-be going through this journey right now 👊🏼♥️ I’m here feeling your worries too.  Anyway, maybe we can turn this post into something positive and each share what we’re most excited about becoming parents?! I’ll go first: I’m excited for cuddles with a mini human that Alex and I both created together 🥰 #25weeks #25weekspregnant #pregnancy #firstpregnancy
user_24;user_2455.jpg;Sharing what’s on my #bookshelf 💁🏼‍♀️ what are your favourite books and cookbooks right now?! With most of us around the world staying home, there is no better time to dust off those cookbooks and learn to cook or discover new favourite recipes. For most of us, our lives are so fast paced, we barely get time to stop and enjoy simple activities like baking.  Today I pulled open my first book, Elsa’s Wholesome Life and baked my peanut-nana bread, one of my favourite recipes that I haven’t had time to cook for years! Mind you I did have to tweak the recipe slightly by using some alternatives that I already had in my pantry so that I could avoid an extra trip to the shops 😆 #stayhome
user_24;user_2456.jpg;Cozy Sunday night dinner ⚡️ #vegan mac-no-cheese. You can find a few versions of this dish across both my cookbooks, as well as my YouTube channel 🙏🏼 Sunday check-in: How are you guys staying entertained and sane during #socialisolation ? It looks like Australia will be going into lockdown verrrry shortly. The situation changing almost hourly here. It’s been so surreal to watch it all unfold 😓  Wish you all good health and sending positive vibes around the world 🙏🏼💕🙏🏼💕
user_24;user_2457.jpg;NEW VIDEO 🎥 my mid - week Byron Bay stay-cay • we take you to most of our favourite places to eat, see and shop around Byron 🙌🏼 so while you’re probably stuck indoors at home, hopefully this video gives you some inspiration for a trip once everything cools down 🙏🏼 link in my bio to head to my YouTube channel ♥️
user_24;user_2458.jpg;Some things I like to do while social isolating that 100% lift me out of a weird mood: - hug my dog - kiss my dog - give my dog belly tickles - sing to my dog - talk to my dog like it’s a hooman - look at old photos and videos of my dog - send my sister videos of my dog doing weird things - come up with new nicknames for my dog, the current one is “oat milk latte”  and if you don’t have a dog, you can look at this collection of Oatly as a pup 🐶 I literally flick through my camera roll or highlight reel on insta every day. She brings me soo much happiness I can’t explain 🥺🥺🥺
user_24;user_2459.jpg;This snuggly set has me excited for the changing seasons here in Australia 🐻🍂 @zuluandzephyr what are you all watching on Netflix right now? I got a feeling I’m going to be needing some binge worthy shows these coming months ♥️

user_24;user_2461.jpg;Today is World Sleep Day 😴🐨 and getting a healthy sleep each night has so many health benefits including: improved mood, healthier lifestyle choices, more energy, improved learning and memory and better mental health. So I’ve teamed up with @koala to give you guys the chance to WIN a Queen Koala Mattress! Here’s how: 1. Comment below WHY you desperately need sleep? 2. Comp is Australia Wide and ends 29th March  Sleeping on a @koala mattress for the last year has been one of the best things for me in getting an undisturbed sleep each night due to their anti-partner disturbance feature.  I know in just 4 months time I’ll be getting a lot less sleep with a newborn so I’ll be making the most of my full nights sleep on my Koala bed 🐨😴🙌🏼 #koalapartner #koala #giveaway #worldsleepday #sleepwithkoala

user_24;user_2463.jpg;23 weeks today 🕊. This was from a couple of months ago on film 📸 (about 15 weeks). I remember thinking how big my belly felt at this point 🤭 now it kinda just looks like I went silly on the hummus. Each week I’m feeling new feelings, and seeing more body changes (hello thighs touching and abs weakening! Oh and NEW blood vessels 👋🏼) I’m getting softer, physically & emotionally. Only a couple of years ago all of these body changes would have terrified me. I am realising how far I’ve come mentally... Happy International Womens Day 💕 thankful for all the women and mothers around me who help inspire me on my journey to motherhood.  Ps. Can’t wait to get our next rolls of film developed, always exciting to see what’s inside! ❤️ #pregnancy #23weekspregnant #internationalwomensday #women #film #35mm

user_24;user_2493.jpg;Simple wholesome van meals on the road 🚐 Whenever we do a van trip I always take the role of van cook! I simply just LOVE being in the kitchen cooking, and when travelling I often don’t get to do a whole lot of it, hence why I probably love the van trips most! Can anyone relate? 🤷🏼‍♀️ what I love about cooking on the road is the challenge of making meals from minimal ingredients, and using those to make a variety of dishes. On this trip I flicked through a lot of the eBooks in The Vegan Bundle for simple ideas and then just made do with as little ingredients as possible. This was our breaky every single morning.. oatmeal with berries, coyo and a sprinkle of granola 😋 Also, while on van trips you get to pull up and have breakfast in some pretty amazing locations 😜 #vanlife #vanmeals #vegan #NZmustdo

user_24;user_24102.jpg;2014 me VS 2020 me! I want to share with you all a bit of a personal story and journey, one that I NEVER really thought I would share. Reading through the “Overcome Emotional Eating” eBook (written by a psychologist) inside of The Vegan Bundle really sparked something inside of me, There is a workbook within this guide that I have been reading and working through, and I have found it so so useful and interesting and so I want to share my story with you guys, because I think that this eBook could truely help many of you.  In 2014, I was in my second year of my Dietetics degree, I was OBSESSED with eating healthy and “clean”, to the point I hated social occasions and would use “veganism” as a cop out to skip the birthday cake. I was OBSESSED with counting calories and weighing myself, OBSESSED with exercise except I didn’t want to do anything with weights in the fear of gaining “weight”. I never ate any sugar, anything processed, I grazed on veggie sticks and fruit during the day and binged on dinner and dessert when I came home. I went to bed every night regretting all of the excess calories that I ate that day. I was an UNDERWEIGHT BMI, yet I saw that as “healthy”. I was self conscious. I hated being home alone, fearing that I would start snacking and wouldn’t be able to stop myself.  Fast forward to 2020, I weigh almost 10kg more than I did then. I LOVE eating wholesome whole food & plant based but I also LOVE to have a burger, fries, or cake! and I don’t feel any GUILT after eating those. I can have 1 biscuit after dinner and not binge on them. I have 3 good sized meals a day and hardly snack between because I’m satisfied from my meals. I don’t count calories, or skip meals, so I’m not constantly thinking about food and calories. I weigh myself maybe every 3-6 months. I workout 5 times a week but don’t feel this extreme guilt or the need to workout double if I miss workouts for days in a row. I do weights and I want to build lean muscle.

user_24;user_24124.jpg;I’ve been adding @florahealthy Udo’s Choice Oil Omega 3:6:9 Blend + DHA to my meals each day. This plant-based blend contains unrefined DHA from cultivated algae (which is actually where fish get their DHA!) so it’s more sustainable, vegan and free of environmental contamination! Contains: DHA, ALA, & EPA.  Here’s 3 simple ways you can incorporate Udo’s Oil into your diet: 1. Add 1 tbsp into your smoothie 2. Swap our 1 tbsp of olive oil for 1 tbsp of Udo’s Choice in hummus. 3. Add 1 tbsp of Udo’s Choice to your pesto, which can be added to salads, pasta or toasties (like my vegan toastie recipe in my new book) 4. Add it to any salad dressing.  It does have a nutty, earthy taste so I would recommend half substituting it in a recipe rather than fully substituting the oil such as olive. This oil also should be kept refrigerated and don’t cook with it, as heat will damage the fatty acids. Head to my story supplement highlights for more info and a link + discount #florahealth #algae #veganDHA

user_24;user_24141.jpg;Posting this from last weekends pre-wedding impromptu shoot because for the first time in my entire life I was ready 3 hours early 😱 3 hours! And actually had time to take some photos 😜 if you don’t know my husband, Alex, well he is the worlds most punctual human, we are always the first to any dinner, we’re at the movies before the previews even begin and his life motto is “if you’re on time, you’re late”. And if you do know Alex, I’m sure he’s told you that. There’s no better way to explain our contrast on this characteristic then to tell you I was 40 minutes late to my own wedding 😯 (of course, because he wasn’t there to keep me on time 💅🏼) But after almost 9 years of our relationship, I’m starting to appreciate how good it feels to be early and not be stressed and rushing all of the time...I think he may just be rubbing off on me 🧞‍♂️

user_24;user_24160.jpg;A change of season but Porridge will stay on the regular for me 🙋🏼‍♀️ I’m obsessed with this recipe: 1/2 cup oats 1 cup of water 1/2 cup oat milk Pinch of salt 1/3 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp hemp seeds 1/2 pear - pre-baked 1 tbsp Macadamia butter 1 tsp coconut sugar  How to make: 1. Cut pear in half, place on baking tray, cut side facing up, and bake for 30 minutes at 160 degrees Celsius. Do this step at beginning of the week and prep enough for whole week, just reheat before serving. 2. Add oats, water, oat milk, and salt to a pot and bring to boil, reduce and simmer for 3-5 minutes, adding extra water if necessary (personally I like mine on the runnier side). 3. Pour into bowl, top with diced reheated baked pear, cinnamon, sugar, nut butter and hemp seeds. Pour in a little extra oat milk if you like. Yum!

user_24;user_24161.jpg;Spring blooming... “What you plant now, you will harvest later.” - 🌸  I think to me this quote applies to everything in life. Be kind to people now and they will be kind back.

user_24;user_24175.jpg;An organised and abundantly stocked pantry & fridge is a great way to feel inspired to eat healthy and be prepped for the week. 🌈🥦 dont you just feel soo much more inspired when you open up the doors to a tidy pantry!  My “PANTRY ORGANISATION & FARMERS MARKET HAUL” video is live on my YouTube, plus there’s a real & honest look inside my fridge - no it’s not as “goals” as this beautiful image by @thrivingonplants  I’ve also shared my tips & tricks for labelling & organising your pantry & storing herbs and greens so they last the whole week (and more!) Second picture (pantry) is by another one of my fav inspirations @raw_manda  Enjoy the video 😁 hopefully @mariekondo would be proud because it’s certainly sparking joy for me 🙈  #organisation #pantryorganisation #fridgegoals #plantbased #vegan
user_24;user_24176.jpg;"EAT YO GREEEENS 🥦👅 5 years ago I created “Elsa’s Wholesome Life” with the goal to inspire people all around the world to #EatMorePlants via this Instagram app.  I started sharing iPhone snaps of the food I was cooking at home while I was studying nutrition. Soon people were asking for recipes so I started typing them up and sharing them via a blog. About 12 months later I purchased my first DSLR camera and a year after that I published my first recipe ebook online. By the end of my uni degree I had a book publishing contract in hand and enough brands wanting to work with me to keep me busy enough to continue working online and not need seek a job in my profession.  My first cookbook was released in Australia in 2017, and became a best-seller. Through my cookbook I was able to reach new people who stumbled across it in their local Kmart or big W, and spread the eat more plants philosophy.  I then travelled and lived overseas for 2 years gathering inspiration and recipes to write my second cookbook, which comes out in 1 month. The Global Vegan aims to bring together cuisines from around the world in a plant based version.  Right now I am living back home in Australia and finding joy in the simple things I once took for granted; my own bed, a routine, and the beautiful southern Gold Coast. Feeling inspired to keep sharing my wholesome life with my online community in the form of recipes, nutrition information & healthy lifestyle tips 🌈 #theglobalvegan #elsaswholesomelife #eatmoreplants"

user_24;user_24182.jpg;Your plant based guide to IRON is up on the blog now! But quickly lets chat about iron and supplementsss ❤💪🏼 Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world! In Australia, a staggering 1 in 3 women don’t get enough iron through their diet. In America, it's 1 in 4.  You can definitely get all the iron needed for optimum health from a plant based diet, however just because you can doesn't mean everyone is always able, from busy lifestyles to biology getting in the way. To maintain my Iron levels, I use plant-based ‘Floradix Iron + Herbs’ by @florahealthy to boost my iron & Vitamin B12 levels. It’s in a liquid form (non constipating and easier on your body), tastes good and it’s mixed with Vit C for max absorption.  If you’re interested in trying their products, you can use my code ELLIE20 for 20% off (for all my Aussie followers you can find Floradix in most chemists, grocery stores, and natural health stores - brand is named FMD in Aus)  SWIPE ACROSS FOR MORE INFO!  #BeFloraHealthy #nutrition #elsaswholesomelife

user_24;user_24192.jpg;Gut happy breakfast 🥳 High fibre wholegrain sourdough (with gluten!), avocado, lemon rind & hemp seeds + probiotic rich sauerkraut. I have been loving learning more about gut health! It’s an area of nutrition I find particularly fascinating. Here’s a few tips! 🌱 Eat MORE Plants! Eating a wide range of plant-based foods is the best way to improve your gut health. That means incorporating new and different vegetables, fruits & wholegrains into your diet. Don’t just stick to the same limited variety of veg! A healthy gut has a wide variety of microbes and these microbes feed & thrive off of different foods. 🌱 Eat more fibre! This goes hand in hand with the last point since veggies, fruit & wholegrains are high in fibre. These “prebiotics” feed our existing microbes, plus keep things moving along down there 💩 🌱Don’t just avoid “problem foods” such as onions, garlic, chickpeas & gluten. Unless you have a medically diagnosed allergy, they are not causing inflammation. If you feel gas/bloating/pain etc it may just be your guts inability to digest it properly or an oversensitive enteric nervous system. Instead just eat these foods in smaller quantities, and slowly increase the frequency. That means avoiding the whole tub of hummus and just having a tablespoon a day! These foods are actually particularly good for our microbes and avoidance will only make symptoms worse. 🌱If you have been put on a low FODMAP diet, work with a trained professional (dietitian or doctor) to follow the correct procedure of reintroducing these foods slowly. Long term elimination of all FODMAPS is not good for your gut! It was designed to determine the particular FODMAP foods that cause GI symptoms so you can then reincorporate it slowly and in qty’s that you can handle. 🌱Eat more probiotic rich foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha & live yogurt (dairy free coconut for me!) 🌱Avoid anti-biotics unless absolutely necessary! They kill off your good bacteria. Supplement with a probiotic supplement if you like. I use @florahealthy Adult Probiotic, with 6 adult specific strains of bacteria 🦠

Thank you so much @spell and @theclimatecouncil for inviting me to join your Climate Council Retreat this week through their partnership with @1percentftp  It was a truely life changing couple of days for me. Meeting some incredibly inspiring people, learning about Climate Change, engaging in real conversations and reflecting on ways we can make a difference within ourselves and our own communities.
