user_12;user_122.jpg;cozy, slow coffee mornings ☕️ reading, journaling, and cuddling with my squeaky boy are honestly what i am living for right now. questions i am asking myself this season: 🤍 what parts of quarantine did i love that i can continue to cultivate in my daily life? 🤍 how can i be kinder to myself? 🤍 what new habit would i like to develop during cancer season, and what steps will i take to do that? 🤍 what does living in alignment really look like for me? 🤍 what does it look like to prioritize my spiritual practice + my creativity daily? 🤍 how am i speaking up for my truth + not letting things fester? 🤍 what can i continue to release and let go of? 🤍 how can i feel good in my body every day? 🤍 MANTRA: life flows through me with ease. i speak up from the depths of my soul. i prioritize my creativity. 🤍 what are some of yours? here for you. love you guys. xx #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_123.jpg;happiest father’s day to my heart and soul, my daddio. 🤍 daddy, there is no one on the planet quite like you. for all of your stubborn, impatient, strong headed qualities you are equally generous and kind with the most sensitive heart. kinda like someone else i know 😉 every year i grow older i only realize more and more how similar we are- many would say the same person. i wouldn’t trade that for the world even if we’re both, you know, difficult at times. you are the REFLECTOR to my reflector, and that’s a gem i will carry in my heart for all of time. you are also one of my very best friends, biggest advocates, and the one who has taught me to always chase what i believe in. you believed in TBB before i even did, and how lucky i am for that gift. this day with you will forever be one of my most cherished memories- dancing to “stand by me” which has been our favorite song for as long as i can remember. forever your little girl, jojo 🌸 #tbbmademedoit #byronneedsaninsta #soulonfire
user_12;user_124.jpg;ASK TBB ANYTHING! 👇🏻✨ did you know i have a weekly newsletter? it’s full of juicy content you won’t find anywhere else. there is a Q & A, community features, exclusive recipes, spiritual deep dives, and more. leave your questions below and i will save them all to include! the more the better! signup for the newsletter, out mondays, at link in bio. 🤍 p.s. this was my first time putting on jeans in about 4 months and DAMN- it felt good. #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_125.jpg;"today is my 7 year blogging anniversary!!! 🎉✨ i started my blog on an airport floor in 2013 on a whim (after i missed my plane and had hours to kill 🤣) to share healthy recipes and lifestyle tips purely for fun. and i kid you not, after my plane landed in laLA and i had 80 people following- i was hooked. it immediately felt like my calling. this was before there was a blogging industry or even any $ to be had in blogs. it was purely for the heart and passion and connecting with other people in the world who loved what i loved and sincerely got as thrilled about kale, yoga, juicing, and spilling my heart onto the page as i did. fast forward 7 years and MANY iterations of my brand along the way, here we are. i wouldn’t trade this job for the world; which still to this day feels hardly like work at all. head to my BLOG today, linked in bio, to read all about my journey, who inspired me to do it full time, how i’ve done shit differently than others since day one, + 7 things i’ve learned in 7 years!!!! also how i’ve been blogging in a way since 4th grade, via AIM, then MySpace, then my college blogs, and now we here baby 🙌🏻🙌🏻 plz share below how you found me and when!!!!! you guys make this possible. thank you. i love you. TBB tribe is my whole heart and i promise to keep doing this til... forever!!!! as long as you promise to be here! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #7years"
user_12;user_126.jpg;the bright blonde is back ✌🏼 and it feels GOOD! i notoriously spend very little time on my outer appearance.. i don’t wear makeup, get my nails done like once a year, go so long between hair highlights and trims that my family starts begging me to make an appointment 🤣 (byron’s exact words were “didn’t you used to be blonde?” 😤) and yet every time i do, i’m reminded that these simple acts of self care feel so refreshing. FYI i am so obsessed on the other hand with facials, massages, etc so that’s where i spend my time usually. if you needed to hear this today, carve out that time for you. it’s worth it. hair by the BEST @kelcey901- who fun fact i’ve known all my life. 🤍🧚🏻 whats your FAVE FORM OF SELF CARE?! #tbbmademedoit #901girl #soulonfire
user_12;user_127.jpg;What an absolute honor to have @iamrachelricketts on @tbbpodcast today discussing all things racial justice, spiritual activism, healing collectively, Black Lives Matter, her work as a death doula, and so much more. We also talk about Human Design, astrology, and channeling because... DUH. Rachel has incredible channeling tips & I loved hearing her process! 🤍 A few weeks ago I took Rachel’s two courses on spiritual activism and let’s just say my MIND. WAS. BLOWN. As we mention in the episode this deep inner work is not *fun* but damn is it important, and ultimately so very enlightening to WAKE UP, become a better version of ourselves, and become better allies. I love her SPIRITUAL APPROACH and we also get into stories about her life, her mother, and so much more. Drop us a 💕 below if you’ve listened and a ✨ if you plan to - I wanna hear your thoughts!!! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #BLM #spiritualawakening
user_12;user_128.jpg;how’s everyone doin? 🤍 i don’t even know where to begin. i’ll try to keep it short and sweet. in the midst of this collective awakening, my own spiritual gifts have intensified and my angels have spoken loud and clear. NO MORE NOT LISTENING!! is basically what they’re saying to me 🤣 as usual with a deeper awakening, it’s been both exciting and a lot to handle all at once. i am shedding old layers and really purging a lot which can be very dark. i thank the universe every day for the sweetest husband who handles my ups and downs on this journey with immense support and love (and lets be real a little bit of “wtf is going on??” vibes- lol!!). all of this to say, you can expect that things will be shifting around here a bit. i’m still figuring out what that looks like. but it’s time, and there’s no more ignoring it. 👽✨👁🌱🧚🏻 deeper healing and awakening is happening. are u here for it?! more on this to come... #soulonfire
user_12;user_129.jpg;my everyday go to meal right now for the IBS flare i’m in, and it sounds like many of you agree 🙋🏼‍♀️ gluten-free, grain-free, vegan avocado toast! topped with paprika and a bit of hot sauce because i was feelin’ wild. this was after a large lemon water (delivered in bed by my hubs), probiotic, and a cold brew coffee, eaten slowly on the couch while i read ‘the daily stoic’ and journaled my heart out, with J & Huddy by my side- TO GET SPECIFIC! also i have been waking up at the same time every morning lately (on the early side for me) to cultivate more routine in my life and that has felt amazing. mornings are my haven, my safe space, my favorite. what’s your specific morning routine? tell meeee!! 🌿☕️🤍🍋 #tbbmademedoit #morningroutine #plantbased
user_12;user_1210.jpg;where are my fellow IBS warriors at?! ✨ today’s blog post is full of tips for bloating, stomach issues, pain, and stress during this wild time we are all living in. i share my current mantra, the louise hay affirmation for stomach and intestinal problems: “i digest life with ease.” in the post you will also find my go-to meals and tips for stomach flares, and beyond that — how to find spiritual fullness rather than reaching for food to cope / emotional eat during this time 🙏🏻 can’t wait to hear your thoughts!! this post feels like going back to my ROOTS, the reason why i started blogging all those years ago- finding my balance with stomach issues. leave me a 💜 if you’ve read the post or plan to!! happy weekend my loves! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #ontheblog #ibsawareness
user_12;user_1211.jpg;it’s the end of a long week, and that means it’s time for some healthy vegan PEANUT BUTTER CUPS!! salt-oil-sugar-free, gluten-free, plant based, and only two ✌🏼 ingredients! also a quick reminder that however you feel right now is totally and completely okay. do something for you this weekend- bake your favorite treat, take a long bath, tap back into your spiritual practice perhaps. do it because you deserve it and the world needs your light 💡 and make these bc they’re SO GOOD and too easy not to!!! the recipe is- melt sugar-free, vegan chocolate (my fave brands are tagged in the photo) and drizzle it into the bottom of muffin tin liners. freeze for 5 min, then add your PB layer (you can also do powdered peanut butter mixed with water & a dash of maple syrup if you want a lower fat option, which i did here), freeze for 10 min, then take them out and top with more melted chocolate!! freeze again for 5, then keep in the fridge for the best consistency!! ENJOY!! tag someone you’ll make these with this weekend 🤍🍫 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #vegansofig
user_12;user_1212.jpg;dear jordan from two years ago today,  wow. there are hardly words to describe the depths you will go over the next two years. many days it will feel like you’re swimming in a sea of endless pain and sickness, both physical and emotional, but in the process you will reach into the deepest ethers of your soul. there you will find that you can dig even deeper, into realms previously unknown. you will awaken in this process. some days the pain will outweigh everything and you’ll be unsure if living continues to feel possible. other days you will be reminded of the eternal nature of joy, of the magic that is this earthly plane and how lucky you are to be here. you will be surrounded by people who will hold you in your darkest days, while others will fall away and that’s okay. the soul family you will meet on this journey will blow your mind and you will never again feel alone. you will get married (!!) and even though you’ll be terrified to feel sick on that day, it will be your healthiest day in years. maybe even in this lifetime. soak in every moment. it will be perfect. you will open up psychically, channel 👽 and all sorts of 👼🏼, embark on many plant 🌱 medicine journeys 🍄, and return to veganism for healing. you will get (much) sicker before you get better, but ultimately you will start to heal. for that, it will all be worth it. stay the course, be open, be resilient. healing is possible.  love, your future self | 6.11.20
user_12;user_1213.jpg;hi hello how how are you feeling today? let this be your daily reminder to be kind to yourself right now and always. it’s ALWAYS okay to put you first because only then can show the f up for others! anxiety is running at an all time high right now and it’s interesting to see how that may manifest in your own life. for me, it manifests as physical pain and raging insomnia. my stomach has been a mess and all of my gastrointestinal issues are flaring up, so i am working on being easier on myself and eating SIMPLE, plant based (always) meals that feel comforting and nourishing to my body. our minds, bodies, illnesses, dis-ease symptoms, and beyond are all so interconnected... that is the main message i am getting from Spirit right now. also to really slow down and really speak and exist mindfully. i am working on a blog post for my fellow IBS + chronic illness warriors for this time specifically so plz leave any questions below!! 💚 P.S. i will be donating all proceeds from my ebooks + courses this week to colorofchange.org to help fight racial injustice in our 🌍 so if you’ve been thinking of purchasing, now is a good time! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #plantbased
user_12;user_1214.jpg;good morning from my messy hair & yes, COFFEE ☕️!! this is a monday morning unlike any other. our world is shifting, important conversations are taking place and being HEARD, and we are in the midst of a true revolution. i will never pretend to have all the answers or any at all, but i do promise to do the work and continue to strive every single day to make my platform a deeply inclusive and fiercely loving space for ALL. this work will be a marathon, not a sprint. in my own life i’m having the conversations, educating myself, and staying tuned IN to the voices of the wonderful black creators, authors, and educators i’ve discovered throughout the last few weeks and beyond. i will be integrating this inner work into my platform in a meaningful way moving forward — for all i’ve learned in the last few weeks has opened my eyes to the truth that there IS no wellness until we are ALL well. 🖤 all of this said, how is your heart today? how can i + all things TBB best support you during this time? don’t forget to take care of you — that’s where it all begins. 🙏🏻
user_12;user_1215.jpg;a small snippet from my letter to my community today ~ the full letter can be found on user_12.com. i was planning on staying silent this week out of respect but felt a deep responsibility to speak up and share what’s been on my heart as i learn and awaken deeper — which i hope may inspire others to do the same. i am doing the shadow work + learning about my whiteness and privilege, and it is NOT a show and tell contest so the post is not about that... it’s about the eternal nature of our souls, the guidance of spirit during this time, and the awakening taking place on our planet. my intentions are all rooted in love and unity. my soul is waking the f up, and i wanted to share- NOT bc this is at all about me, which doesn’t even need to be said. because this soul work is important and we owe it to our fellow humans to do it. 🖤
user_12;user_1216.jpg;muted but not silent 🤍 here to listen, learn, grow, reflect, support, and do the work. thank you @blackandembodied & @jessicawilson.msrd for starting this movement to amplify the voices that need and deserve to be heard. my feed posts will be muted for the next week as well as sponsored content (this should go without saying), but i will be on stories sharing resources from BIPOC starting later this week. i am here to learn and be an ally- and i fully recognize my place right now is to LISTEN, amplify, and support. if you feel called to share specific resources and/or requests i am all ears as always. all love. #hereforjustice
user_12;user_1217.jpg;“we are here to awaken from our illusion of separateness.” - thich nhat hanh. these are words that i live by. not just today, not just now, but every day and always. 🤍 i acknowledge that i will never, ever understand what it’s like to be a person of color in america, but i see you, i hear you, i stand with you. i will be going inward this week and doing deep soul work that my heart, soul, and entire being is calling me to do. in times like these i seek the language of the soul, the one that knows no separateness. anyone’s injustice is everyone’s injustice. this is our planet to heal. #justiceforgeorgefloyd
user_12;user_1218.jpg;i talk a lot about healing and love on this platform, and in every moment of every day i try to be a beacon of light to every soul i encounter. that is why it would feel horribly wrong to me not to address the tragic death of george floyd and the horrific racism and bigotry suffered in our country every single day.... the antithesis of everything i believe in and stand for. it is all for nothing when there are people being killed simply for the color of their skin. as a woman of privilege who has never once had to worry about walking out my front door and not feeling safe, i am the first to admit i have a lot to learn. i am deeply grateful for the resources out there sharing petitions to sign, books to read, organizations to donate to, and BIPOC accounts to follow to further educate myself and learn (you can find some of those links and resources tagged on my stories). i am also grateful for beautiful journal prompts from the fabulous @lisaoliveratherapy such as “how has wanting to be good, nice, and likable kept you from engaging in discussions of racism?” and “what do you want the world to look like for all humans?” i am committed to learning and will not stay silent. i am here to grow and learn and spread love in action. i will not turn a blind eye. we will be the change. 🤍 #georgefloyd
user_12;user_1219.jpg;"i am not who i once was. i have changed. 🕊 being sick will do that to a person. healing will do that to a person. i’ve woken up spiritually in ways i previously never thought possible. four long water fasts, countless deep plant medicine journeys, years of transitioning my body to a completely whole food, plant based sos-free diet, shedding layer after layer, opening up to healing my lineage, speaking daily to my angels, guides, pleiadians and beyond, have all woken me up and shaken me to my core. i tried to find the words to share about my latest water fast on the blog today. i hope you enjoy and i can’t wait to hear your thoughts. after this fourth water fast i’ve begun to see the world in a bit of what i can only describe as 5D, and there’s no looking back. it’s like the veil between this world and the next has lifted. i am still processing (very, very much so) but will of course be taking you guys along for this ride. thank you for waking up with me and allowing me to express myself in all of the ways as i heal and step into the new; healed; awakened me. #tbbmademedoit #waterfast #lymediseaseawareness"
user_12;user_1220.jpg;i am home now from my recent fasting experience but i am forever changed. i am still trying to find the words to describe this challenging, humbling, transcendent, deeply healing experience. i encourage you to always be open to challenging the status quo, whether that be a medical system that profits off of people who are chronically ill 😷 and tells us we can’t heal - or whether it be a system that still perpetuates racism and hate in this country. it’s up to us to speak up and be the change. i know in my heart and soul that when it comes to chronic illness, we CAN HEAL!! don’t let the broken system tell you otherwise. i am proof of this and plan on dedicating my life to spreading this message 🙏🏻 i have so much more to share on this soon... leave your q’s about fasting & healing below and i will include them in an upcoming podcast episode. 🤍 #tbbmademedoit #healingjourney #lymedontkillmyvibe
user_12;user_1221.jpg;today’s lunch bowl of my dreams ✨!! i’ve been loving having a simple bowl of fruit in the mornings followed by more fruit throughout the day, and then having a really delicious jam packed salad topped with the goods for a late lunch! this one was kale, romaine, zucchini, cucumber, steamed kabocha squash & air fried tempeh, topped with my TBB nacho cheese sauce and drizzled with stoneground mustard!! the greens were massaged with lemon and a bit of coco aminos. simple, delicious, salt oil sugar free, vegan 🌱!! as a side note i have LOVED learning all of your fave housewives and kardashians in stories after yesterday’s podcast episode with jonathan! 🤣 share your faves below if you haven’t yet! and tune into the ep to learn his!! #tbbmademedoit #plantbased #veganrecipes
user_12;user_1222.jpg;this boy deserves a major shoutout. not only is he today’s guest on @tbbpodcast (!!) but he goes above and beyond for me every day. he visited me so much at the healing center and carried me when i couldn’t walk, wiped away my tears when i cried (which was a lot), and of course - if you know him at all you know this - made me laugh hysterically at every turn. today on the podcast we are talking all about marriage, what it’s like being in quarantine together for all these months, J going vegan 🌱!!, reality TV shows i’ve turned him onto (🤣!!), TIKTOK, the future of the fitness industry, what we’ve learned as a couple since getting married, and so much more. i am thrilled to have my very private husband + best friend as my guest today! leave us a 🤍 if you’ve listened and a 🌸 if you plan to!! thank you my babe for coming on the show 🙏🏻 cannot wait to hear all of your thoughts!!! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_1223.jpg;FRUIT CEREAL 🥣!! what’s your relationship with fruit? serious question! singlehandedly one of the best things i’ve discovered on my healing journey is how much i thrive when i eat an abundance of fresh fruit. getting rid of that fruit fear so many of us are taught to believe has been everything. apart from being one of the most healing foods on the planet, fruit is majorly antiviral, anti microbial, anti aging and full of vitamins, minerals, water, and the glucose our bodies and brains need to thrive! it also sweeps through our digestive systems like a broom 🧹 which is incredible for detox and healing. when i eat plenty of fruit throughout the day i feel blissed out, satiated, and honestly high off of the health properties and clean energy flowing into my body! AND the spiritual abundance that comes with eating natural food from the earth?! priceless. this combo is bananas, berries, plums, dried mulberries, and “banana milk” aka one banana blended with water and cinnamon. topped with more cinnamon! 🍌🍭🍇💫🌸🥣 will you try this?! and tell me more about your relationship with fruit below. 🤍 (p.s. when eating fruit remember food combining principles for optimal digestion, more info in my ebook!) #tbbmademedoit #fruitheals #fruitcereal #plantbasedvegan
user_12;user_1224.jpg;what to even say when your entire inner world has changed? i hardly know where to begin. the main thing i want to say is that healing is possible. we do not have to live on in pain. ✨ our bodies do remarkable things when we give them the space to rest, breathe, and repair. to try to put into words what this two week fast did for me — it shifted my vibration into a state where illness in my body simply cannot exist any longer. years of deep inner work, spiritual awakening, and diligent physical healing are all finally taking hold. i am emerging anew, seeing the world from a different lens than ever before. thank you earth, nature, my resilient body, and nature’s candy 🍭 aka magical fruit from the earth that’s bringing me back to life. so much more so share soon... it feels so good to be here, fully me, more me than ever before. 🙏🏻 #waterfast #healingjourney
user_12;user_1225.jpg;this was me on my honeymoon sipping sparkling water and eating homemade raw bliss bars because that’s what makes me happy 😆 goin wild!!! no alcohol, no unhealthy food, i don’t need that kind of stuff to celebrate. when i look back on myself in years past i see a girl who was trying to fit in and please others by doing what felt “normal” and socially acceptable... from drinking to eating unhealthy food to straying from the plant based life that has been nothing but a gift to me. i stumbled upon this photo this morning and my heart was filled with joy because, this is me. i am now unapologetically myself 100% of the time and it feels so good. my ultimate goal is to feel amazing every day, and that’s exactly what i do! sometimes people will judge and that’s okay - that says everything about them and nothing about me. 🙏🏻 so if you too find yourself different, out there, going against the grain, know that that’s awesome and there’s no better feeling in the world than stepping into your truest YOU! ✨ fueling my body with food from the earth and ditching booze has been my favorite thing about my life in YEARS! what about you? do you drink, are u plant based?! tell me! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger #soberissexy
user_12;user_1226.jpg;day 10 🕊
user_12;user_1227.jpg;day 8 on 💧 and the healing glow is so real. not only am i feeling better than i have in years but i truly feel like the luckiest human in the world. i wake up every morning so full of excitement to live this life, to evolve further on my soul’s path, and to squeeze out every drop of the day in a body that is free of pain. and to gaze at my healing body in the mirror knowing how far i’ve come and realize... this is all i’ve ever wanted. i am right where i’m supposed to be. my mantra now is, “Life is easy, I am in the flow.” try it with me. 🤍 p.s. jonathan is here with me today and i am so damn HAPPY. #waterfasting #healingjourney
user_12;user_1228.jpg;i just learned that it’s national chocolate chip day and you guys knowwww i would never miss out on this celebration 🍫💃 i am six days deep into my current water fast and it’s been amazing (can’t wait to tell you guys everything!!) and i am dreaming of these incredible TBB vegan chocolate chip blender muffins- SOS-free, gluten-free, and delicious! you can find the recipe on my youtube and blog 🤍🙌🏻 who’s gonna make these this weekend?! can’t wait to recreate when i’m home... SOOOO many updates for you guys on the healing plan i’ll be following from here out. i’ve never felt so clear. or good. ahhhh!! happy wknd 💋 #tbbmademedoit #nationalchocolatechipday #veganrecipes #wfpb
user_12;user_1229.jpg;on day five of my fast and reminiscing on how amazing this year has been despite battling lyme to its very core once and for all. there have been so many special moments and i have experienced more FLOW and ALIGNMENT than ever in my life. creating detox your life earlier this year was a passion that flowed through me like a dance with the universe... and getting to see it touch your lives daily is the icing on the cake. now, being able to help heal others with the salt-oil-sugar-free plant based life, detoxing, food combining, the power of juices and greens, and ultimately with recognizing our mindset and the innate healing power ALL of our bodies have inside... is everything. it makes me want to cry 😭 in fact i was up all night last night detoxing lyme in the biggest way. it’s painful and far from easy. and the universe spoke to me and said, “this illness has been your teacher. listen deeply. you’re healing, and now you get to fly.” 🕊 FULL. CHILLS. insane amounts of gratitude. life is good you guys, for all of us, and only getting better. make that your mantra today along with me. 🤍🌱💫🦋 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #healingjourney #plantbased

user_12;user_1231.jpg;caffeine free, sugar free whipped “coffee” ☕️ for my fellow healing warriors who love the coffee life but the coffee love does not always love us back 🤣!! i am on day two ✌🏼 of my water fast and ready to go deep on this healing journey, and come out lyme free! i am ready. committed. in it. and dreaming back on the day i made this v trendy whipped “coffee” situation. the recipe is... 2 tbsp chaga powder, 2 tbsp monkfruit sugar, 2 tbsp water, whip together with a frother or whisk (it takes time.. be prepared to put some muscle in!), poured over some chilled coconut mylk and DAYUMMMM it’s heaven on earth! OPTIONAL to add in 2 tbsp dandy blend, and also double the recipe to get it super thick!!! who will try?! and send me good vibes for the healing 🤍🕊 it’s been amazing so far and i am so grateful to be able to share this experience with all of you 🙏🏻 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #plantbased #whippedcoffee
user_12;user_1232.jpg;me explaining to my husband why i need him to make me celery juice every morning and bring it to me in bed 🌿🤣 it’s a must. who’s with me?! also, i hope all the mamas out there are being pampered and loved today as you deserve!! huge shoutout to my mama, i love you to the moon and back. you are my best friend in the world! i am soaking in my last afternoon at home with my boys for the next few weeks before heading back into lyme treatment... sending love to all! 💚 #tbbmademedoit #tiktok #mamasday #celeryjuice #medicalmedium
user_12;user_1233.jpg;current feels: i haven’t felt this healthy, happy, or full of life force and energy in so long!! YEARS! it feels amazing, and surreal because i still barely even recognize this feeling. jonathan and i have been going on long walks every night that sometimes turn into runs, and this new routine fills my body and soul with a joy so deep there are not even words. ask him, i will randomly sob in the street saying, “this is my life. i am healthy. i am so grateful. holy shit.” moving our bodies is medicine!! nature is medicine!! HEALING is possible, and healing is finally happening for me. i want this for everyone who has suffered, and my purpose in sharing the healing message with you guys has never felt so rooted or aligned. good things are happening... and this is only just the beginning! AHHHH!! how are you guys today? i love you 🤍🌿 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #healingjourney
user_12;user_1234.jpg;what do you guys do for work?! tell me! 🤍 stumbling into the wellness blogging and now podcasting, book writing, and holistic healing path has been the ride of my life for the last 7 years. when i was little i wanted to be “an author and an actress” and i have been obsessed with health since i was about 11. oh and i always wanted to save all of the animals! so i would say, minus the acting, i hit it pretty close!! the best part of all of it for me is you guys - our community. i literally don’t know where i’d be or who i’d be without you guys in my life for all these years. today on the pod we are going into my wellness blogging journey, health coaching experience, body confidence part 2, answering your q’s on business, and more. have you listened? and i wanna hear what you all do & how you enjoy it!! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #plantbased #healingjourney
user_12;user_1235.jpg;feeling sOoo blissed out after doing a heavenly @unplugmeditation on the @mindbody app. #ad i know i’ve been talking all about nourishing our bodies in quarantine, but it’s equally important that we are nourishing our minds. last week i was flooded with a massive wave of anxiety because i felt so out of my routine - glued to my phone, not moving as much, putting unnecessary pressure on myself to create. meditation is a true game changer for me and always brings me back to my center. mindbody has rolled out an amazing new virtual platform where you can access the best in self-care services while supporting local & national businesses in fitness, wellness, meditation and beyond- link in bio to explore! i’m going to try breathwork next. 🤍 what are you doing to keep your mind calm during this time? here for you always! #tbbmademedoit #mindbody #soulonfire
user_12;user_1236.jpg;today i put real life clothes on, looked in the mirror, and it hit me. i’m HEALTHY. i’ve been living the anti inflammatory plant based life for three years and slowly but surely, day after day, i have been healing. not to mention after my recent water fast i’ve truly felt like a new human (which is why i’m going back!!). i’ve had energy to run, do ab workouts, take long walks with my husband, work, film videos, come up with fun new ideas, write, cook, and more - sometimes all in ONE DAY 🤯 this is a far cry from my life in bed for the last few years. i am a girl who bounces off the walls when she’s healthy and happy. that girl is coming back. i am so dedicated to living pain free, kicking lyme’s ass, and continuing to heal. i have never been so dedicated to something in my life. 🤍😭 and it’s finally, finally paying off. so... ASK ME ANYTHING about healing and i will answer u below! we all deserve this life of radical healing, wellbeing and health. #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #plantbased #lymediseaseawareness #lymediseaseawarenessmonth

I DID IT! so much more coming soon... so much to share... ✨🌈🌞🤍 thank you endlessly for your support, i love you all! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #lymejourney #waterfast
user_12;user_1264.jpg;🦋 fasting update day 8 🦋 so much healing is happening. this fast has been deeply spiritual, even more so than physical. i am learning so much about myself, facing the darkest parts of my shadow, bursting with creative ideas, and most of all- feeling the lyme dying off in my body. every day my mantras are: “one day at a time. mind over matter. healing for my boys. i am so much stronger than i know. this too shall pass.” those words are on a constant loop in my head and have been giving me so much strength and guidance. they are also potent words for what’s going on in the world right now- so feel free to take them as your own. our MINDS hold the power. never before in my life have i been so sure that i am healing, or so determined. going inward, that is the magic. ✨ time for me to take a few days to myself + off of my phone to soak it all in... i love you all, your support on this entire lyme journey has kept me strong. thank you. 🙏🏻 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #waterfast #lymejourney #healing
user_12;user_1265.jpg;i deeply feel that this is a time to go inward, to remember that there is nowhere to be but the now moment, to come home to what truly matters. ✨ in today’s @tbbpodcast solo episode i go deep into how this time on earth is happening FOR us and not TO us, the similarities between the isolation we are in and living with lyme disease, and share a new meditation for finding peace in chaos. 💕 none of this is the diminish the pain that is surely going on in the world, as i fully recognize the pain is real. because it’s real, we are being forced to view new, at times dark, sides of ourselves. there’s no more escaping from our shadows in that way. 🙏🏻 i am here for you and i can’t wait to hear your thoughts! leave me a ❣️ if you’ve listened and a 🙌🏻 if you plan to. xx #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #tbbpodcast
user_12;user_1266.jpg;we have time right now. nature has forced us to take a step back and return to our hearts, our homes, our spirits, and get really comfortable going inward - where the magic happens ✨ i know this situation is scary and challenging in many ways, and my heart hurts for all of the pain. but on the other end, it’s beautiful to see how our mother earth is healing already during this time. and i’m over here healing on this water fast (day five!!) but that doesn’t mean i can’t drool over some GOOEY vegan mac & cheese from my recipe ebook ✨ code TBBLOVE for 11% off the ebook and everything in my digital store during this time- link in my bio. ✨ i am getting so, so, sooo inspired during this downtime to create in my kitchen when i get home. cooking is therapy. it’s healing. food is medicine. the whole food plant based way of life has been my greatest healer and i am so beyond grateful. will you make this yumminess?! 🙌🏻 #tbbmademedoit #detoxyourlife #plantbaseddiet
user_12;user_1267.jpg;day 3 fasting update 💧 last night was one of the most physically and emotionally taxing nights of my life. i strongly feel it’s the lyme dying off in my body, and this detox is like nothing i’ve ever experienced before in my lifetime. it brought me to my knees and i ended up praying to god for the first time since i was a child. i pray a lot, but i don’t usually pray TO god. last night i felt the call loud and clear, and i asked him for healing. i told him that i can’t take the constant pain anymore, i know i’m strong and i can go through anything, but my body needs a rest. i was awake the entire night and truly wondered at times if my body would be able to get through it. i did, and i have a whole new appreciation for this strong, amazing, healing body. i know this is my journey and i will heal. we are ALL collectively going through a lot right now, so i wanted to share because although pain shows up differently for all of us, we are all one. we are healing as a collective. the meantime is the hard part — but so, so much good is coming. 🙏🏻 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #lymewarrior #waterfast
user_12;user_1268.jpg;this collective pause feels like a time to go inward, like a gift from the universe wrapped beneath the layers of uncertainty. i am heading into deeper layers of healing for the next few weeks, water fasting 💧but also purging old states of being. going deep, stepping into who my soul is ready to be, while peeling away the layers. this has been in my consciousness for a long time and now the universe is saying loud and clear- now is the time. everything in my calendar (and everyone’s) has been cancelled for a reason. i’ve always been a reflector and whatever is going on in the world, is going on in my body x100. water fast round three, let’s do this. i’m coming out lyme free. calling it into existence. heading there today and will miss my boys immeasurably, but i have never been so ready. 🙏🏻 #soulonfire #lymewarrior #healingjourney #lymediseaseawareness

user_12;user_1270.jpg;to brighten your day, we have a brand new podcast episode with this goddess ray of light @kenzieburke • we are talking all about food combining, mindset, healing lyme with a plant based lifestyle, overcoming criticism, and most of all bonding over doing things against the grain. from the moment kenzie walked in my door for this interview i was floored. she RADIATES, and not only did i see her face shape shift (a ton) but it happened immediately when i laid eyes on her. if you listen to @tbbpodcast then you know - the face morphing is the real deal. she is so 👽 and so 🔥 and she is now one of my favorite humans who i will never let go of because she is THAT special, next level, real, incredible, kind, radiant, and down to earth. i know you guys will love this ep & learn a lot- not to mention she is 23 (!!!!) and building an empire! if you don’t usually listen to podcasts, i feel like now is a good time to get into them. find this ep on itunes, spotify, youtube, my site, or anywhere you like to listen! drop us a 💛 if you listen and a ❣️ if you plan to! xx #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #kbhealth
user_12;user_1271.jpg;like the rain cleanses the earth, our souls are being cleansed by stillness. ✨ this one came to me loud and clear, and i wanted to share because we are all one 💞 and the words have been pouring out of me this week. tag a friend who might need to hear this today 🙏🏻 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire

user_12;user_1276.jpg;i woke up this morning knowing i wanted to share my story of picking out my wedding dress on the blog today 🤍 this is a pic from the first time i ever tried it on... the third dress i tried in the very first store where i looked. it was nothing like i imagined i’d choose but immediately i knew it was THE ONE. on the blog i’m also discussing fear and my take on how to deal with it. there is a lot of chaotic energy floating around right now, for good reason, and as empaths we soak that shit up like a sponge. i hope my wedding dress story and my words about finding peace in chaos will bring you some happiness and a smile today. that is all i want! p.s. my DAD picked out this dress, which i share in the post! also i share new pics from our first look, and more. head to the bloggy to read 💭 & i cannot wait to hear your thoughts. #tbbmademedoit #thebalancedbride #jonathangetsyounger #weddingdress
user_12;user_1277.jpg;can we talk about how good avocado toast is? 🤤 my stomach is normally not big on grains, but after recently completing detox your life for 22 days alongside of our awesome group, my stomach has felt more primed to digest gluten-free grains every so often. i don’t have any rigid rules with myself, which i feel is important for you to know. i maintain an SOS-free plant-based diet because i love it and it has helped dramatically in my healing, but other than that i love.. grains, legumes, healthy fats, vegan cheese, sugar-free desserts, what have you! IN moderation. because i know what works for me. i always encourage you to find what works for you, and it likely won’t be exactly what you see working for someone else. no judgment, all love. 💛 do you always with the goal of feeling amazing AND... eat the damn avo toast if you like it / when your tummy can handle it!! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #lymewarrior #plantbasedhealing

user_12;user_1279.jpg;every so often i wake up and feel an overwhelming desire to send this girl so, so much love and tell her that she is whole and brave and perfect. last night i couldn’t sleep so i went through photos on my phone from the last few years, and oh my god you guys - it really hit me how traumatizing these years have been. nothing about them has been normal. yet again because i pushed through and kept living, podcasting, blogging through much of it i always tell myself it’s been... my new normal? not that bad? and i have so many great things in my life it’s hard to get too down on it all- my family, my marriage, amazing friendships, a career i love. but some days i feel like a chunk of me has been taken out... my health. my normalcy. my carefree nature. i am realizing more and more that life feels upside down. so for however long it takes i will continue to heal, put myself first, and honor her (the girl in the photo) because she dove into a massive surgery with so much bravery and not a single ounce of fear. i channel her every day. i want to become more intentional for her- to cut the fluff and be honest with you guys without the sugarcoating. but mostly be honest with myself. so today i send this girl love and i will peel myself out of bed even though it feels impossible- to walk and live and play because she couldn’t. 💛 #lymewarrior #tbbmademedoit
user_12;user_1280.jpg;some days the pain is so bad my body simply begs me to drop what i’m doing and to go into deeper states of healing. this week it was clear that i needed to clear my schedule and just be. it’s easy to get so caught up in the hustle and forget what our priorities really are. lyme has been such a teacher because it doesn’t let me slip into those old patterns. the moment i do, the pain intensifies so badly and i’m back to square one, realizing these teachings are meant to be lifelong and not a quick fix. this week i will be resting. diving deep into my soul, taking downtime from work, just being. returning to my essence. allowing myself to return to healing. i would be lying if i said this wasn’t frustrating or hard, but i know the gifts and upleveling it will bring will be worth while and just the magic i need. #lymewarrior

user_12;user_1282.jpg;words escape me when i try to describe how special this boy, this moment, is to me. he dated then married me when i was too sick to get out of bed. most of our dates were in hospitals and doctors offices or with him laying by my side patiently while i’ve sobbed about how much pain i was in. that still happens, a lot actually. but what also happens is that now after three years together we can go on dates just because and enjoy each other’s company and laugh all night and be the silly little kids that we are. we can go OUT just for the sake of it and be in the world and eat yummy vegan food and i don’t have to be as worried about my body crashing afterward or being in too much searing pain to enjoy it. last night was so special for this reason i could cry. jonathan, i can’t wait for a lifetime of just because dates and adventures with you. thank you for being my person. 🥰 #lymewarrior #soulonfire

user_12;user_1285.jpg;there was some SERIOUS angel light, orbs, rainbows ✨ and otherworldly energy in this photo, which is so fitting because today we have the fabulous psychic medium @maryannthemedium on @tbbpodcast! we talk about intuition, how to open up psychically, channeling, where souls go when they pass on, my journey waking up to my gifts, and she gives me the most incredible reading. maryann is my spiritual mama and mentor- she helped me wake up to my own psychic gifts that are now becoming a part of my daily life. i get so excited about this spiritual awakening journey i could cry. i know in my heart that it’s why i got sick with lyme, so that i could slow down, open up, and wake up to this psychic nature of my soul that was there all along. the awakening is rapid you guys- i can’t wait to share more. leave us a 👼🏼 if you’ve listened to the ep and a 🌈 if you plan on it, and while we’re at it a ✨ if you feel yourself waking up too! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_1286.jpg;so often i think about how much nourishing, plant foods from the earth have saved my life. 🌱 when i was a teenager struggling with severe stomach issues i leaned toward veggies and fruits and they helped me feel the energy and calm in my body no other foods could give me. in college when i went vegan i became the new ME, feeling healthy, starting my blog and taking myself out of situations that no longer served me. and now, on this lyme journey- plant based foods have been everything to me. my number one healers. as well as plant medicine.. all magical plants 🌿 from the earth have been so nourishing and so delicious, and have given me a passion and a purpose throughout the struggle. this whooole journey is detailed in DETOX YOUR LIFE, my plant based recipe ebook that’s now avail (with 60 drool worthy plant based recipes) at the store link in my bio. 💚 this creamy cilantro dressing in there is a fave... have you joined us / if so what’s been your fave recipe?! drop me a 💛 if you’re thinking about joining! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #detoxyourlife #plantbased

user_12;user_1288.jpg;anxiety... we all have it. i know i do. i really believe the more sensitive, intuitive and empathic we are the deeper the chance will be that we experience anxiety. i also believe that opening up psychically has increased my anxiety levels because — homegirl is a VERY sensitive being in an extremely sensory overload kinda world! a few things that help me are... one, writing my daily gratitude list. two, getting outside and grounding in the earth. three, being with people i love who help me get out of my head. and four, channeling! channeling is something i teach in waking back up to your own soul, which is now available again in my brand new digital store 🙌🏻 soul course, baby! highly recommend diving in to learn all of this spiritual awakening goodness. tell me- do you experience anxiety? i’d say some days i’m a 10/10 so i get it. what helps you? 👽 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #healingjourney

user_12;user_1294.jpg;yesterday i took myself to the beach for some grounding, inspiration, and solo time. i can’t even tell you HOW MUCH i needed it. i brought my journal, listened to music that lights up my soul, and put together a “life formula for my healing” that includes... moving every day, getting nature medicine daily, writing for fun every day, not over committing, channeling 👽, allowing the psychicness to come through, less screens, going inward, microdosing (yes, going there), and lots of personal things i’ll share at a later date. 🙈 it was true soul medicine and i am feeling so filled up today with my new PLAN!! anything i should add? the pleiadians were coming through so strongly. btw today the FAB FAB @melissawoodhealth is in @tbbpodcast and you must listen- she inspires me to NO END!! i am so excited about it!! have you listened? #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_1295.jpg;hi, hi! i thought it was time to reintroduce myself & share a few things you may not know about me 👋🏻!! 1. i started this blog almost 7 years ago to document my vegan food and it quickly turned into my favorite place to be.. and sooo much has changed since then. 2. i was born in sacramento, ca & went to a very tiny school for 14 straight years with the same kids the entire way through. it was a unique experience that shaped so much of who i am today. 3. i went to college in LA as an english major, and also did my first yoga teacher training during that time which became my full fledged love. 4. then i moved to NYC for grad school (creative writing MFA) but ended up leaving school to pursue blogging full time! best decision i’ve ever made. 5. i am all about going deep. surface level anything bores me. talk to me about intuition, aliens, healing, magic, anything but surface. 6. people often don’t believe me but i remember being born. :) 7. i speak in hyperbole always. 8. raw dark chocolate is my favorite food. and eminem is my favorite rapper of ALL TIME. 9. i’ve been some form of “sick” my entire life, and after being diagnosed with lyme two years ago i’ve finally been given the opportunity to heal. it’s the hardest thing i’ve ever done but is so so worth it. 10. the last few years have been all about opening up psychically for me. lately it’s something i’ve decided to explore much deeper & will be bringing you guys along for the ride. 🥰 okay let’s hear about you!! tell me! what are a few fun facts? and which of these did you not know about me?! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #healingjourney
user_12;user_1296.jpg;couples who farmer’s market together 👫 have the most fun!! i am still living for the fact that jonathan is plant based with me now and we have so much fun living the vegan life together. also i wanted to give a quick marriage update because it’s been nearly four months now that we’ve been MR. & MRS. ALBRECHT!! 😱 overall it feels different in the best way. he feels like family to me more than ever before. it very much feels like “us” in ways it’s always been just “me.” when we butt heads or disagree, we come to a conclusion sooner because why argue with someone you’re gonna be with forever? it takes more effort to surprise/“date” each other being married but that effort is somehow all the more worth it. i still love calling him my HUSBAND in public and i get butterflies when he calls me his wife. all in all, best decision ever. 💯 i talk a lot about our relationship in my episode on @lizmoody’s pod from last week, give it a listen! and TAG YOUR LOVE below, i wanna get to know your other halves!! 💘 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger #marriage
user_12;user_1297.jpg;i’ve been craving more tattoos lately- like MAJORLY. i like little delicate ones. i got this libra symbol when i was studying abroad in italy nine years ago. i’ve always loved that libra represents balance and harmony, and the cool thing is that i only love my tattoo more and more as i get older and dive deeper into my spiritual journey. astrology is now HUGE in my life. i am an air sign through and through, and relate to all my libra qualities. i love people, love keeping the peace, and i am an indecisive libra forever. with a cancer moon, aquarius rising, aquarius north node, and of course reflector in human design 🔮 so tell me- where to go for new tattoos? what can you see me getting? i have ideas and the inspo is flowing (psychic and otherwise)... ⚡️ #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #libra
user_12;user_1298.jpg;you guys know i’ve been fighting chronic inflammation for a long time now, including wildly intense eczema. diet has helped my inflammation so much, but as far as products i use when i’m in a flare i love @gladskin_us because it focuses on ingredients inspired by the nature of skin and also balances our skin’s microbiome. it is free of preservatives because they know preservatives kill the good bacteria in our skin that we need for healthy healing. this cream combined with the sos-free way of life, i feel like i have a good toolkit for fighting eczema now when it flares, which is still a lot because... lyme life. if you deal with it too you will love this brand and their mission. where are my other eczema warriors?! p.s. head to my stories for before and afters. 💛#tbbmademedoit #gladskin #soulonfire #chronicillnesswarrior #ad
user_12;user_1299.jpg;sometimes i have no words for how dreamy my husband is. he writes me every morning before i wake up, and it helps make that tedious time of day where my lyme symptoms are always the worst so much better. also, it blows me away what a poet he is. the depth of his soul knows no bounds and he sees me to my core. i keep a lot of the super romantic stuff he does between us (because he much prefers it that way!!) but today i had to share because i have never felt so seen. “you have the warrior spirit and fragility of rain.” 🦋 thank you for showing me true, unconditional, romantic love @inspire_people!! you make every day feel like magic. thank you for reminding me that i married a true poet. and thank you for always knowing i’m more 👽 than human. i love you, my boy. p.s. we are all so so deserving of the deepest most magical soul deep love.. never forget. 💛 #soulonfire

user_12;user_12101.jpg;first of all, hi 201 👼🏼! second of all, i wrote about something really important and dear to me on the blog today- finding a balanced relationship with food while healing from lyme disease. living with a chronic illness is so hard, every day is basically a crap shoot, and the one thing that helps me most is eating pure, plant based foods from the earth. but i am a rebel by nature (ask anyone who knows me...) and my husband @inspire_people noticed that i do this thing he nicknamed “impromptu impulse eating” when i am stressed, or when we travel, or when i just want to rebel against what i know feels good. BEEN THERE?? i dove deep into writing about it today and it felt real good, over on the bloggy. i hope if you’ve ever felt the way i do, or if you struggle with lyme and finding the right foods for you, that it will help you. leave me a 💚 if you read it and a 🖤 if you plan to! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #lymewarrior

user_12;user_12103.jpg;the truth is i haven’t been feeling very well on this trip, and i have extreme PTSD about slipping back into a life of living in bed where i’ve been for the last two years. i’ve seen so much improvement lately yet one tiny burst of symptoms can send me into a mental tailspin. is feeling good over? was that as good as it was going to get? its... frustrating. at times devastating. but it’s my life and i have no other choice but to know it’s all happening as it’s meant to. anyone recovering from lyme knows- routine is key. self care and downtime is needed. so grateful for a day of spa treatments with this boy but even more so for his patience. his love. his understanding. the way he catches my eye at a glance and looks directly into my heart, and just knows. for pulling me out of how i feel and into the world again. healing is a delicate dance and it is NOT easy but my heart beats on with happiness to do it with him by my side, my everything boy. #healingjourney #lymewarrior #mylove

user_12;user_12108.jpg;just a girl standing on her old street, drinking a green smoothie, screaming with happiness to be surrounded by such magical, electric energy. ⚡️ i have the most wildly fond memories of living in new york. i started my blog here, somehow figured out how to turn it into a business, left grad school to pursue my truest passion of blogging and sharing healthy food... and met some of the greatest people i will ever know. new york has a pulse to it, a real electricity and heartbeat. if you’re lucky enough to live here or have ever lived here in your life, you know. new york has a soul of its own, and it stays in you forever. i am endlessly grateful for every moment i get to spend in this city, and for being healthy enough for the first time in 1.5 years to make it back here. 🗽 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #tbbinnyc

user_12;user_12110.jpg;plant based & salt-oil-sugar-free in NYC! 🌿 if there’s any confusion around sos-free i want to break it down for you- it’s a balanced plant based diet! i eat carbs, fats, legumes, tempeh, fruit, veg, all of it. eating this way gave me true food freedom because foods from the earth on their own are so anti inflammatory, colorful, and supportive to healing. they are fun to get creative with and they’re so yummy. you can also make the sos-free lifestyle your own! on vacation i’m lenient and i love hitting all my fave vegan spots. this diet is meant to be inclusive and it’s a true way of life. nothing more, nothing less. romping around the west village today and HAPPY AS CAN BE! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #plantbased

user_12;user_12114.jpg;a note on living your purpose: no one can do it for you, but when you find that thing that lights you up and makes you glow from the inside out, you’ll know. i have had the hardest few years. years that have truly tested my patience and my will to be on this earth doing anything, let alone something i love. when i lost my health i lost everything. i really didn’t see the point in living with such immense pain, even though deep in my heart i knew i would never stop trying to heal. and the thing about losing everything is, you then have a new foundation to build your life upon. and eventually, piece by piece, you gain so much more than you ever had before. a life rooted in deep, radiating purpose and belief in something bigger. sharing this healing plant based lifestyle with you guys IS MY PURPOSE, so much so it could make me sob and do a happy dance all at once. i created this healing program for those of us who have sat in that darkness, for those ready to rebuild. if you’re struggling, I SEE YOU!!! we got this! detox your life with me at the link in my bio, and at the very least add a few more plants into your day to day and see what happens... they’ve been my little saviors 💚🌱🍭 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #detoxyourlife #plantpower

user_12;user_12121.jpg;let’s talk about FRUIT!! 🍌🍒 the fruit fear out there is so real, you guys. i was sucked into it for years sadly, but now that i eat a diet of predominantly fruits and veggies i feel so free. and so much better!!! fruit is the most detoxifying food on the planet. it cleans you out like a broom. it’s high vibrational, magnetic, delicious, and full of powerful antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. as @medicalmedium said on this week’s @tbbpodcast episode, “fruit has it’s very important role. you can’t be afraid of something that never made anyone sick to begin with.” i dive DEEP into all of this and more in my new healing program and ebook. TWO DAY COUNTDOWN to the launch 🚀!! who is excited? and where do you stand on fruit?! happy to share so much more about this if you guys are interested!! 💚 #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #medicalmedium #fruitislife
user_12;user_12122.jpg;i have never met someone quite as selfless, connected, tapped in, brilliant, kind, and overall soul on fire in every way than i have @medicalmedium. it is an HONOR and a thrill to have him on today’s episode of @tbbpodcast 🎉 going deep on his connection to spirit, his thoughts on autoimmune disease, lyme, celery juice, healing, living with his truly surreal psychic gift, giving every moment of his life to help others, and so much more. this in depth, juicy convo is a favorite of mine on the podcast to date. anthony is a dear friend and a true healer, and whether you agree with his philosophy or not, you will learn so much from his open spirit and his insurmountable knowledge. and yes, he is the founder of the CELERY JUICE MOVEMENT so can we just take a second to appreciate this delicious morning celery juice?! 🤤 🥤 🎙 YAY!!!! drop a 💚💚 if you’ve listened and a 🌿🌿 if you plan to!!! #tbbmademedoit #medicalmedium #celeryjuice #tbbpodcast #soulonfire
user_12;user_12123.jpg;eating sos-free & plant based has drastically changed my life in every way. 💫 when your body is clear, your mind is clear. when your mind is clear, you can be a clear channel for all that comes through spiritually, intuitively, creatively. eating sos-free (salt oil sugar free) foods from the earth has really been my greatest catalyst for both healing and opening up in a psychic way. i am so passionate about it i could talk about it for days... and i am sooo excited to share all of the details with you in my free live workshop tmrw evening! you can sign up at the link in my bio! and these yummy recipes will be in my “detox your life” healing program & recipe book launching saturday!!! p.s.

user_12;user_12124.jpg;after seeing a sneak peek of my new healing program yesterday (launching THIS WEEK!), my dear friend and longtime photographer @ashleystreff described the branding as “step into my TBB vortex of higher consciousness where in this realm you’ll learn how to be a little more Avatar vibey with your human body since you’re a part of the earth and we need to heal it and connect to it again versus the 20th century culture we were born into” 👽🦋👼🏼 and UMMMM I HAVE NEVER FELT SO SEEN!!!! my soul is dancing hearing those words! i am curious- what words do you think of when you think of TBB? this is our community after all, not just me. that’s the best part... let’s all be avatar healing human aliens together and get the most healthy and detox our LIVES !! 🙏🏻💫 #detoxyourlife #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #tbbtribe
user_12;user_12125.jpg;losing such a legend today is an important reminder that life is so short, so fleeting, and no matter what we accomplish here on this earth nothing even holds a candle to the love we share and the lives we touch. i’ve always felt that some of the most special of souls leave this world early, as if they’ve come here to teach us important lessons about humanity and then they must go - leaving us reeling to soak in the fleeting essence of life, giving us the potent reminder that love is the only thing that matters. opening up psychically in the last few years has given me a very unique perspective on death, as i now believe and know with my whole heart that our souls live on in an eternal universe. it’s overwhelming to think about how much life can truly change in an instant, just as it’s overwhelming to think about the vastness of our universe. hold your loved ones closer tonight and always. 💔 RIP kobe & gianna. #kobebryant #soulonfire
user_12;user_12126.jpg;vegan brunching with our favorites 🌿 are you a savory or sweet breakfast person?! i’m all about the sweet... give me all the smoothies! my new ebook and healing program has a whole section on eating out SOS-free and plant based - it’s really easy and fun once you get the hang of it. so excited to release it one week from today. and i am feeling so, so filled up after a morning with humans we love so much. what’s everyone up to this weekend?! 💚 #tbbmademedoit #veganbrunch
user_12;user_12127.jpg;healing chronic inflammation with plant based foods 🌿... it works. this is me in april vs. me now, and every time i see it i get choked up. i am an entirely new woman, inside and out. the biggest difference is i finally put myself first. i got serious about living a SOS-free plant based life, doing my detox protocols daily, food combining, slowing down, tuning in spiritually, and basically... embracing a whole new life. i cannot WAIT for next wednesday, 1/29 to share all of this with you and more in a free online workshop about healing chronic inflammation through plant based foods. i know this is my purpose here on this earth, to help others heal! and i am elated to be able to share this lifestyle with you. link in my bio to join the workshop. 🌱 TAG a friend who needs to see this & SAY HI below if you’ll be joining next weds so i can thank you!! 💚 #tbbmademedoit #detoxyourlife #chronicillnessawareness

user_12;user_12130.jpg;just a little reminder that healing takes time. ✨ if you listened to my solo podcast this week then you know i’ve been shifting my mindset to believe i am HEALING rather than i am sick. it helps a lot, but what also helps is going with the flow. holding too rigidly to being fully healed when my body is working hard to be in remission has never been the best for me either — i rush into things! i want to have fun and live my life and get back to everything i love!! and then i crash and burn!! sound familiar? it’s kinda like a metaphor for life... 🙃 lyme is my greatest gift but man does it test my patience some days. it’s so silly that we identify ourselves in all these ways really... so just for today, i’m going to say, i am JORDAN. not sick or healing or anything in between. and as i am, i am happy. i am enough. who are you? 🥰 #soulonfire #lymewarrior #lymediseaseawareness
user_12;user_12131.jpg;i’ve been reflecting a lot lately on my blogging journey and what an amazing ride it’s been. i started my blog nearly 7 years ago at the very end of college to share my vegan food photos and recipes. almost immediately i realized that i was equally interested in sharing my life and my heart with you guys. it quickly became all of my passions rolled into one! i felt like i was buzzing every time i wrote for the blog, took photos, connected with likeminded people, etc. it had my whole entire heart, and for about a year and a half i did it on the side, every day, with so much passion. until i left grad school that is... and decided to give this thing a shot. fast forward 7 years and if you would have told me i would get to do this FOR A LIVING my jaw would have been on the floor!! this photo was taken at a sound bath event yesterday hosted by a lovely brand that brought together so many women that i love. throughout the sound bath i legitimately felt nostalgic for THIS LIFE!!! this is such a good life. such a special one. i love getting to wake up every day and do what i do. if you love something, go for it. give it your all. when you live a life fueled by passion, there is only one way you can move — forward. even though blogging is now my career, it’s never been about making money for me, and it never will be. it will always be about sharing my life, spreading the wellness and high vibe messages, expressing creatively, and connecting. grateful for you ALL!! and this freakin life!! tell me, what is your dream life? ✨ #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_12132.jpg;guess who’s back, back, back... back again 💁🏼‍♀️ TBB’s back, tell a friend!! but seriously guys, i am back for season two of @tbbpodcast and i am so happy i could cry!! i took several months off for my health and to be fully present during the season of our wedding and it lead me to new levels of healing, major inspiration, and a massive reinvigoration of excitement for the show!! i’ve been recording with incredible guests for the last few weeks and am kicking off season two with a SOLO EPISODE all about where i’ve been, what i’ve learned, and learning to live with less rules ✨ i’m hosting a giveaway for peeps who post a screenshot of the show in their stories! and ultimately JUST WANNA HEAR WHAT YOU THINK! will you listen today?! comment a 🌸 if yes!!! love you all, thank you for being patient with me. so much goodness to come! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #tbbpodcast #shesback
user_12;user_12133.jpg;when you transform your life, everything around you transforms. ✨ making simple switches in my diet like juicing more often, going plant based, eating alkaline and cutting out refined oils, salt and sugar changed. my. life!! it aligned me with all that’s meant for me in the universe (like manifesting @medicalmedium on @tbbpodcast - my dream guest!!! out in two weeks!) ✨ i can’t even tell you how much better life gets when you actually feel good... which looks different for everyone, but i hope my new ebook + detox your life reset program (!!!!) out on 2/01 will help you pave the way to find your healthiest YOU!! and i am so, so stoked because @namawell juicers will be giving away one juicer to someone who joins the reset in the first two weeks, but you can also get a 10% off discount on their juicers any time with the code BLONDE! 🌿🌱 this is a very special company. if you plan to join the reset program, a juicer will be an amazing addition to your life!! tell me- what are you doing to up level your life RIGHT NOW? let’s hear it!! ✨ #tbbmademedoit #plantbased #detoxyourlife #tbbreset

J and I are staying in and cooking after a very hectic (but fun) week!! share your plans below + a 💚🌿 if you’d eat this!!! #tbbmademedoit #tbbtravels #plantbased #vegansofig
user_12;user_12137.jpg;being plant based is not a diet, it’s a lifestyle. 🌿 returning to being intuitively plant based nearly three years ago has been so healing for my body from the inside out, and it has given me the ultimate food freedom... for the first time in my life!! eating whole, nourishing foods from the earth have healed my relationship with food/my body and eliminated so many negative symptoms i was experiencing from chronic illness and disease. i used to be afraid of food because nearly everything i ate made me feel sick. returning to food from the earth has opened the doors for me in a huge way — i have finally found what works for me and i am so passionate about spreading that message. being intuitively plant based is about what you CAN eat, not what you can’t eat. it’s about crowding out the bad with the good! it’s about true freedom, and true health. ultimately, eating in this way that is kindest to the earth, the animals and my body is what fuels me to wake up every morning — it’s a passion that drives me so deeply. we all deserve to feel amazing. who is with me?! mark your calendars for 2.01.20 because something exciting is coming. 💚 #tbbmademedoit #plantbased #tbbreset #detoxyourlife #healyourbody

user_12;user_12144.jpg;3 years ago today, on our first date. jonathan kissed me at midnight the night before at a yoga class i was leading to ring in the new year. on the 1st he took me to @honeyhi for lunch & on a walk around the melrose flea market, then we ended up back at his place to watch a movie. i looked into his sweet brown eyes and thought, “oh. he’s been the one all along. my home.” call me crazy but 3 years ago today... i knew. we had been friends for years, always close but always immersed in our own lives. 3 years ago today everything changed. i called my mom screaming, “jonathan kissed me tonight!!!!” and even she knew he was the one. if you have feelings for someone, TELL THEM!! you never knew where you could be 3 years from now... that year my intention was to call in true love 💗 and boy i did not have to wait long. clear intentions, divine timing. this year my intention is to create the happiest home with this boy, my husband, and get healthy for him and our future family. this is my whole heart, right here. cheers to the next 3 and beyond! #happyanniversary #newyearslove #soulonfire
user_12;user_12145.jpg;spending the last morning of the decade in bed with this perfect creature- one of the two best boys to ever come into my life. 🤗 ✨ intentions for 2020: - to keep creating from a space of openness and fearlessness - to create content that helps to heal others on a spiritual & physical level... and take it deeper than i’ve ever gone (we are all ready for it) ✨ - to surrender, surrender, & surrender some more - to trust that the universe has a far greater plan for me than i do - to take things slow as i ease back into work & embrace the “no rules” element of my brand/podcast i am stepping into... + ✨ I WANNA HEAR YOURS! share your intentions below ✨ and one piece of magic you’re creating in 2020! #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #intentionsetting #spiritualawakening
user_12;user_12146.jpg;nostalgia overcomes me this time of year, especially at with the closing of a decade. the depths of emotion bubbling up inside know no bounds. i can literally see and feel past illness and pain and challenges moving and flowing through and out of my body with every breath i take. i have paused to sob my heart out more times than i can count this week, releasing and releasing. i am recalling dreams i had as a little girl and bringing them to the forefront of my life again. i am kissing the ground of the earth for keeping me here after taking me on a battle for my life. i am over spilling with love for my husband for not only coming into my life but for staying. for staying through it all and for kissing my forehead each night and telling me it will all be okay. i am bursting with love for the girl i was all along, before i had the awareness of the vast universal consciousness that i’ve now been shown. i am both happy and nostalgic, marvelously energized yet exhausted. filled to the brim yet depleted. i am both the whole universe and a tiny, healing human body. i am thrilled for everything to come and grateful for what has been. closing one door and opening another. thank you, universe. thank you for this decade. thank you for reuniting me with my sweet love in this lifetime. more on the blog. 💛 #soulonfire
user_12;user_12147.jpg;everything around you changes when you commit to fine tuning your frequency and upleveling your life. ✨ this was a year of huge shifts for me — huge. i went on plant medicine journeys, had two intense surgeries, married my twin flame, took a break from my podcast to redefine to myself who i am at my core, created a spiritual course, was brought to my knees by my illness and was also shown the brightest light i’ve ever known. this week in particular has brought up a lot. the end of a decade brings up repetitive patterns, trauma cycles, pain we’ve avoided for a long time that is now bubbling to the surface. i am doing the work and going inward to honor the girl i’ve been within the last ten years, and also welcome in the intensely powerful woman i am becoming. for the next few days i will be extremely intentional about how i spend my time and where i use my energy ~ because 2020 is the year i honor my heart, fearlessly do me, heal my body, step into the universal consciousness that calls to my soul every day, and s h i f t the frequency in my field ✨ are you here for it? because things are upleveling and i fully plan to bring you along for the ride... 🚀👽🔥 type ⚡️ below if you are HERE FOR THE SHIFTS! & tell me how you’re committing to you for these next few days! // artwork by my beautiful friend @ali.lizzi - you capture the essence of my soul #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #2020 #uplevelyourlife #newdecade
user_12;user_12148.jpg;bed head, coffee, two layers of christmas PJ’s, must be in sac town! ☕️ i started drinking coffee again on this trip home after about a year & a half ish of a coffee break. one morning i woke up and my intuition said, “have COFFEE!” so i listened. i’ve been getting severe migraines and IBS (major constipation) for the last few months & something in my heart told me my body was open to the medicinal properties of coffee helping. i stick to organic coffee ☕️, one cup, and have been feeling great. how i have missed the energy and alertness coffee brings! are you a coffee drinker?! going to go bust out my 2020 intentions now.. i am buzzing 🐝! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #coffee
user_12;user_12149.jpg;our first christmas as husband & wife 🤗 and without a doubt the best one yet. sending you all love today & always- merry christmas, happy hanukkah, happy everything. thank you all for being such a special part of my heart - the true gift is this beautiful life i get to wake up and live every day, thanks to all of you. i love you, TBB fam. 💛
user_12;user_12150.jpg;DO U LIKE TO SWEAT 💦?! YAY OR NAY?! i’m a huge yes. hands down my favorite part of our home is our home SAUNA 🧖🏼‍♀️ it has been key in my detox routine for lyme and mold, it’s my favorite way to relax, and it is also so good for skin, circulation, sleep, joint pain, muscle pain, and even digestion. mostly, the detox is life. i love to unwind at the end of the day with a book or a podcast and just zen out and sweat. you’ll find this @clearlightsaunas100 on my holiday gift guide on the bloggy! and with my code BLONDE you’ll get a discount & free gift with them 🤗 are you a sweat person? what’s your fave way to detox? #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #lymewarrior #lymehealing #healwithheat
user_12;user_12151.jpg;anyone else feel like life is just one big series of divine synchronicities, one after the next? ✨ this serendipitous dinner in bali with our friends came at the perfect time- i had been contemplating going more raw vegan on my healing journey for a while now, and @fullyrawkristina is THE raw vegan queen herself! the last time i had seen her was five years ago at a juice bar in LA! and the gorgeous @raquellemantra is my actual sister from another mister - we talk pretty much constantly and she is my soul twin 🥰 we ran into them at alchemy and had the best, best dinner while on our honeymoon. not to mention these other two gorgeous beauties, and the never ending NUMBER SYNCHRONICITIES!! i know on my stories i’ve been talking about numbers like crazy with all of you... 444, 201, 333, all of the angel numbers!! so tell me- WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER or sign in your life that always reminds you you’re on the right path?! 👼🏼 p.s. i have a numerologist coming on the pod in early jan so get excited!! #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #synchronicities #signs
user_12;user_12152.jpg;just discovering our LATE NIGHT WEDDING PICS & living for them!!! do ya think we had fun? also so sad this jacket never got its moment til there were five people left. 🤪 i still feel so much joy moving through me from our wedding a month and a half ago and have so many thoughts to share about mindset & healing. a positive mindset is EVERYTHING. the boost of love i received on our wedding weekend has carried me through, and between angel healings, ayurveda, herbs, plants, and so much serendipity coming into my life lately (i mean like BEYOND) i know i am truly healing and reaching a new level within myself. i am more open to BEING healthy than ever. my belief is there. and i know i’ve been through this journey so i can heal others. #jonathangetsyounger #lymedontkillmyvibe
user_12;user_12153.jpg;for as long as i can remember i’ve been someone who overflows with gratitude. like a freaking flood. for everything, seriously. it’s a love i can physically feel in my heart that just bursts me open to my very core- and for a long while i didn’t fully embrace that part of me because it’s not always deemed normal to be SO GRATEFUL, joyful, happy, full of love, passionate, bursting at the seams. but those veils are lifting now and 2020 me is just liiiike 🥰😍😘🤪❣️ here i come in all my glory! get ready for it because your girl is full of passion & i feel like i’m getting my life back. my brain is firing again and my body is healing. the gratitude OVER EFFIN FLOWS! that is all. 💃 #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit
user_12;user_12154.jpg;“so... you just eat plants?” 🤪🌱 honestly that’s one of my favorite questions to get WITH the snide side eye it sometimes comes with, because i love showing people that eating plant based does not have to be boring, limiting, or difficult in the least. food from the earth is limitless and makes me so excited and full of passion... i don’t care if that makes me a dork lol 🌿!! today’s late lunch was avocado toast on grain-free bread with a big salad made of greens, carrots, roasted potato, cucumber, and my homemade “nacho cheese” sauce that doubles as a yummy, creamy dressing! the cheese recipe is on my blog, and my upcoming ebook & SOS-free reset will be FULLL of delish, simple, plant based recipes - sign up for my newsletter to be the first to receive the link when it drops! are you plant based, or do you have any hesitations about a plant based lifestyle?! hit me with them & i’d love to answer 👇🏻👇🏻!! i could talk about plants 🌱 for days. HAPPY SATURDAY!! #tbbmademedoit #sosfree #wfpb #plantbaseddiet
user_12;user_12155.jpg;this year has been full of so much growth and change for me, more than any other year to date. from plant medicine journeys, to marrying my soul mate, to breaking down walls i didn’t even know i still had, to taking serious time off to rediscover who i am and what i love most (and don’t love anymore) about my career, to creating firm boundaries i’ve needed for a long time. i am rolling into 2020 feeling SO ALIVE & so spot on with what my TBB brand is about- wellness, healing, high vibes, delicious plant foods, spreading love and community and knowing that we are all eternal souls, we are all one. what do YOU want to see more of from me in 2020? 👋🏻 i’m all ears!! so grateful for each & every one of you. #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #jonathangetsyounger #newdecade #weddingday
user_12;user_12156.jpg;setting intentions for the new decade: have babies with @inspire_people as cute and perfect as my nieces & cousins 💛💫 i love these sweet flower girls 🌸 more than anything. and seriously, i have been putting so much thought into my 2020 intentions and beyond. it’s incredible to take a sacred pause and consider how far i (and we all) have come in the last ten years, and even the last year alone. i feel like an entirely new human, shedding layers and getting closer and closer to who i am at my core with each passing day. i am not who i was at the beginning of 2019- not even close. it’s amazing to recognize. as the decade comes to a close, how are you examining your intentions and goals? what is one intention you have leading into the new year, and/or one thing you’d like to leave in 2019 and let go of? #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger #flowergirls #weddingday #intentionsetting

user_12;user_12159.jpg;now, and then. 🙆🏼‍♀️ both taken this year, with 8 months between the two. 8 months of healing, resting, letting go, going deep, committing to MYSELF, doing the work, taking real time off, overhauling my entire lifestyle. it makes me emotional to think about how much has changed for me in 2019... after a few really, really challenging years, things are looking up. i feel like i am finally getting my life back. my brain power is coming back, my energy is returning, i am exploring how to live and be in the world again. i have so many things (and people) to thank for the massive blessing of healing, but most of all i recognize myself — for going into the fire and doing the necessary work to come out on the other side. and i have A LONG WAY TO GO! but i want you to know, it’s possible. healing is possible. there is a light on the other side, and i am finally beginning to see it. most of all, i am so damn grateful for it all- the hardest parts especially. the deeper the darkness, the brighter the light. 💛 #soulonfire #lymewarrior #tbbmademedoit #healingjourney
user_12;user_12160.jpg;rainy sunday mornings at the farmer’s market with my girls might be better than anything else. 💫 for real, being home after the wildest few months and getting back into my routine feels so good for my heart and soul. i can’t tell you how much i missed these little moments- morning walks, soaking in time with people i love, making yummy food in our kitchen, daily yoga, getting back into my work flow. not to mention, starting life with my husband!!! life is good. feeling so filled up, grateful, and recharged for the new year ahead. what are you guys doing on this rainy lovely sunday?! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire
user_12;user_12161.jpg;“There is not something you’re supposed to do. There’s not something that you should do. There is only that which you are inspired to do. And how do you get inspired except by the contrast? It’s the life experience that gives you the idea of the desire, and then as you focus upon the desire, the Energy flows.” -Abraham Hicks 💫 I am feeling this SO DEEPLY right now creating this healing, detox, and recipe ebook for you guys! I have not been this in the flow in ages!!! It’s a sign of healing to me, and it’s also a true sign of being on my Soul’s path - the Energy is FLOWING & I am pouring over with love and gratitude for it all. Curious, what makes you feel the most in the ~FLOW~? For me, it’s writing and creating, especially centered about health and healing!

user_12;user_12162.jpg;the best i’ve ever felt- our wedding day. channeling this feeling, the love that made me feel so filled up and alive and floating on air and free of all symptoms and pains. i’ll never get over the magic i felt on this day. from pulling spirit animal cards in the morning with my bridesmaids to my first look with my husband 🥰 to reading our vows with the cotton candy sky and setting sun behind us as 201 of our closest humans looked on and held space for us. to dancing the night away to being wrapped up in a bubble of the most cloud nine happiness and light. i’ll remember every moment for the rest of my life 💫 my part 1 wedding blog post is live, and there is so much more to come! leave any questions you have below so i can include them ❣️ #jonathangetsyounger #soulonfire #weddingday
user_12;user_12163.jpg;every wedding needs a great photo booth situation am i right 😜 for real this was one of my favorite parts of our wedding, because i got to hang and talk with everyone individually while we snapped memories together. some of my favorite wedding moments happened in and around this photo booth 💕 thanks to these humans and so many others for making our day pure love bubble magic just like we imagined 💫 my favorite thing we heard about our wedding was that you could feel the love all around- emanating from every person. it was a love vortex!!! which pic is your fave?! third to last of @inspire_people is definitely a gem 😂 #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12164.jpg;11.02.19 - forever. 🥰 hands down the most asked question i’ve gotten about our wedding is- “how did you feel?!” so i popped onto the blog to write my first wedding blog post (part one of what will be MANY!), one month to the day after our wedding. annnd on the blog is a bunch of not yet seen photos!! the short answer is that i felt incredible- just as everyone told me, it was impossible not to feel amazing and energized surrounded by that much loving energy. i lived in the present moment, and all of my aches and pains and daily symptoms melted away. i felt more vibrant and truly high on life than i have EVER felt. i wish that for every bride and i know it’s so, so possible- head to my blog post for all my tips and how i prepped but most importantly... LIVING IN THE MOMENT and being surrounded by our loved ones is what made it so insanely special, what made all my health problems disappear for the weekend. and most of all it comes back to this boy- solidifying our forever is the best thing i’ve ever done. can’t wait to hear your thoughts on the post and to share ALLLLL THE DEETS one by one all month! #jonathangetsyounger #justmarried #lymewarrior #healingjourney #bride
user_12;user_12165.jpg;feeling super exceptionally grateful for life this year. 🌹 i could choose to focus on the challenges and the things that certainly haven’t been easy, but what good would that be doing anyone? trust me you don’t want to know how dark things can feel for me with this illness journey. but i’ve found that the more i focus on gratitude for the simple things, the more my life around me flourishes. practice doing this- for every one thing you are upset about or wish was different, name three things you love about your life or feel grateful for. last night jonathan and i named everything we LOVE about our lives, families, and recent travels, reframing the things that usually are not our favorites. it was so empowering and freeing in so many ways. on that note, tell me- what are you grateful for? 🌹🌹🌹 #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #tbbinbali #lymewarrior #lymehealing
user_12;user_12166.jpg;i often envy the lives of animals- they live in an otherworldly realm, unfettered by likes and comments and social validation and even by time itself, of everyday social pressures to be enough, to be liked, to juggle the complex web of intricacies of the mind with the often harsh outside world of perceived judgment and misunderstanding. of occasional unkind souls permeating their ideologies of their very worth, of negative feedback loops of feeling mentally broken or intensely stressed or feeling less than. free of the self inflected pressures to be more than they were yesterday. not that they don’t feel pain, i know they most certainly do, and if you spend just a few minutes with me you’ll know i’m of the believe that animals are full of a seeping, weaving, otherworldly, beyond time and space wisdom, a cosmic knowledge and understanding that we humans do not so readily possess. they feel pain, but differently than we do. they are at our mercy for love and care, yet many of them receive the opposite. and still they go on. they persevere to the best of their ability and they greet each new day as a brand new canvas of possibilities for spontaneity and for wandering and for enjoyment. for connection. i am feeling the deep pull for a new type of connection, one that begins within myself and gives love to the inner, younger jordan who is screaming out for the same joy, the same love, the same care i both received and gave with full reciprocity upon coming into this world. it all starts there. i am learning, i am growing, i am going inward- and i can promise you, this new year is my year... to do as the horses do, the dolphins, the felines, the soaring eagles, even the ocean, all whom possess some of the greatest wisdom we have here on this earth. my plan is to share less but feel more. to be more like my animal and earthly friends of the natural world. to heal in ways my soul aches, no yearns, no screams out loudly and deeply for. no more playing small, it’s time. 🐎 #soulonfire | 📷 @nathwild
user_12;user_12167.jpg;what an absolutely sensational 🍯🌙 with this boy - my best friend, my monkey, the one who makes me laugh hysterically (constantly), my healer, my forehead kisser, my professional packer (thank gawd), my morning wake up call, and the five year old to my inner four year old. this life with you is a DREAM & we’ve only just begun. thank you for loving me the way you do, for seeking out all the best vegan options for me everywhere we go so i don’t have a melt down, for tripping and falling just to make me laugh 😆... and most of all, for seeing me to my very core. thank you also for making 35+ hour travel days actually ridiculously fun. i love you, i love you, forev. 💚 love, your sunflower 🌻 and now your WIFE! #jonathangetsyounger #honeymoon #soulonfire #honeymoonersforever
user_12;user_12168.jpg;i realized on this trip that i hit my one year sober anniversary- as of nov 10, it’s been a full year since alcohol has even grazed my lips 👄!! not a sip at our wedding, my bachelorette, honeymoon- nada. i can count on one hand the amount of times i’ve drank in the past few years combined (after drinking heavily as a teenager and in college), but this healing journey has inspired me to cut out alcohol completely. drinking wasn’t making me feel like my best self, even in extreme moderation. my hangovers were terrible even from one drink, it made me feel extra toxic, and it was clear to me my body was just done. i have also fallen in love with the spiritual transformation i’ve undergone from not drinking- i am always ME, in my body and completely lucid and aware. most of all, i’ve fallen in love with how much fun i have without alcohol. it was actually bringing me DOWN for a long time bc every time i drank i didn’t feel like me- so now i can go out and feel 100% like myself with a sparkling water with lime and have a blast. i am not against alcohol whatsoever, my philosophy is DO YOU! but i am feeling very proud of myself for going a whole year without so much as a sip... listening to my intuition in full. can’t wait to see where this journey takes me from here 🥂 *water cheers* curious- do you drink? what are your thoughts?! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #sobercurious
user_12;user_12169.jpg;i had a whole caption typed out about traveling with lyme disease and how hard it is to be in an inflamed body that’s pretty much always in severe pain, but then i got captivated by the colors of this oceanic sunset and decided to delete it all and say- I AM HEALING. i will not perpetuate my old story and i will not give chronic illness power over me any longer. i thank my angels and pleiadians and the universe for a husband who lets me lean all my body weight on him when i can’t walk, and for creating beaches and slivers of the globe as beautiful as this island. this IS heaven on earth, i am convinced. i am manifesting a new story now- of radiant health inside and out. it is mine to have, and it is yours too. 💫 in my earthly heaven @nihisumba... 🌙🌕✨🌛 #soulonfire #lymewarrior #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12170.jpg;i didn’t know it was possible to fall this much more madly and deeply in love with you but you’re constantly proving me wrong, my boy. adventuring this world with you is a dream come true and i’ll never take one second of it for granted. thank you for taking care of my heart, always knowing what i need, and for being my soul’s true home. now let’s soak in every moment of @nihisumba otherworldly magic together... k? #jonathangetsyounger #honeymooners #soulonfire #nihigram
user_12;user_12171.jpg;we made it to @nihisumba, our home far away from home. we left our hearts here two years ago and decided we simply couldn’t top this paradise for our honeymoon... so back we came. there is nowhere more gorgeous on EARTH. it’s true magic in every sense of the word. remote, stunning, completely in a league of its own. plus, the people here feel like family to us and we are so happy to be reunited. we are on cloud ☁️ nine and never coming down! and these dragonfruit welcome smoothies... do they know me or do they know me? 🤤 #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger #nihi #sumbaisland
user_12;user_12172.jpg;let’s be real this sweet little monkey reminded me so much of @huddythekitten i just wanted to pick him up and snuggle him like the cat mama i am 😆 until he hissed at me because he thought i was leaning in to take his food!!! also not unlike hudson lol. we had such a blast in the monkey forest, something i’ve never had a chance to do in ubud because of my lyme symptoms on past trips. being with the monkeys 🐒 made me think about so many things, but mostly how passionate i am about animals, the earth, and how much we are all ONE. my heart has been bursting for all of the animals here, and making me feel so proud to be vegan 🌱 after a long road back home to this lifestyle. i am feeling so aligned and tapped into who i am in my SOUL- and it feels so damn good. & i’m lloving every moment of this honeymoon with MY MONKEY 🐒 behind the camera!!! #soulonfire #lymewarrior #tbbinbali #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12173.jpg;what’s your fave fruit?! 🍉🍇🥝🍌🍓 i have so many but here in ubud right now dragonfruit is stealing my heart. close seconds are banana and jackfruit! fresh, juicy fruit is one of my favorite things in the world and i can’t believe there was a day i feared fruit bc of fruit sugar. fruit is nature’s candy, and is so deeply detoxifying. ever since i started following the medical medium protocols for lyme fruit has been a huge staple in my life. i will do a big blog post on it soon. are you yay or nay fruit?! #soulonfire #lymewarrior
user_12;user_12174.jpg;soaking in the glorious magic of mother earth 🌎 i’ve been thinking so much on this trip about how far i’ve come. my body has been through serious trauma over the last few years, and i am usually too lost in how i feel to notice how much i have overcome. the last time i was in bali i was here solo, and on that trip i was too sick to even function. i sat by this pool every day writing poetry and praying for answers to my pain. now, two years of treatment and two major surgeries later- here i am. back in this beautiful place with my love (my husband!). i am deeply feeling these reminders from the earth that while i have a long way to go, i’ve come so far. it’s time to be gentle on myself, to revel in the process rather than the destination... thank you body for being my home. thank you body for teaching me so, so much. #soulonfire #lymewarrior
user_12;user_12175.jpg;mama bali has a distinct way of bubbling to the surface all that i need to face that i have been neglecting for some time. she drops me into this place of stillness - my center, where time moves slow and i return to the earth in a real way, a spacious way. the earth moves at a different pace than we humans do. the chirping of the birds is her music, the rustling of the wind her dance. it is here where i find peace again. answers to my questions come easily, swiftly. pain melts away. the only time is now, sweet child, the earth reminds me. the only time is now. 🌿 #soulonfire
user_12;user_12176.jpg;loving the raw vegan life here in bali way too much for words. my body is really thriving on the fresh fruits and veggies here, so much so that i decided to go all raw on this trip to see how it impacts my overall healing and well being. 💫 so far i have more energy, and have had way less stomach problems than i can remember in so long. jonathan said it’s the LEAST he’s heard me complain about my stomach in ages. maybe that also has something to do with being in honeymoon paradise... low stress is everything for healing. 💫 not to mention, the day i decided to go raw we ran into the lovely @fullyrawkristina serendipitously and had dinner with her and some other sweet friends. she has been a massive inspiration to me on my entire healing journey, so it felt like a sign from above. but when you start to pay attention, our entirety of life is really a sign. 🙏🏻 💫 love from these happy honeymooners - my 🍯 is raw with me too right now & we’re loving the way we feel! #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12177.jpg;thank you yoga, for saving me time and time and time again and making this stiff body feel more human with every passing day. thank you bali, for your magical healing energy and magnetic pull to flow & discover within. and thank you my husband, for letting our honeymoon basically be a yoga retreat. 🧘🏼‍♀️ #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12178.jpg;in bali with my husband and not sure life could get any better. ubud has become like a second home to me over the last few years, to the point where just being here sends a tangible energy through my bones that is so insanely magical. we’ve spent our first few days eating all of our favorite raw vegan foods, doing all the yoga, and having more fun than two little kids in a candy shop. being married to my best friend is off to a great start 👫!! #soulonfire #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12179.jpg;THE ALBRECHTS ARE OFF TO BALI!! on our first adventure as husband & wife!! and to keep basking in this surreal love bubble glow and never let go... 🍯🌙 #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12180.jpg;in true jordan fashion, i followed no wedding rules. i had four maids of honor. these four along with my bridesmaids are my rocks, my soulmates. they’ve seen me through all of my wild phases and every relationship before my @inspire_people came along. they love me for who i truly am and nothing less. my friends are my mirrors, and looking back into each of them my heart explodes with love. we are the company we keep and i am SO LUCKY to have you all, i will never stop screaming it from the rooftops! can you feel the love through the screen?! #jonathangetsyounger | 📷 @tynandaniels @viaimagery | 👗 bridesmaids dresses: @watters
user_12;user_12181.jpg;our first look is another moment that will forever stand still in time. jonathan, like every other person who knows me, assumed i would be wearing a flowy, bohemian wedding dress. but the simple elegance of this dress grabbed me immediately, and it was only the second dress i tried on. it made me feel like my truest self, and gave me that “the ONE” feeling all brides talk about. when i tapped him on the shoulder a few minutes before this moment, he turned around and took me in. he was speechless — i mean, NO WORDS. then he laugh-cried harder than i’ve ever seen him (or anyone) laugh or cry. we took in each other’s souls for the last time before becoming one. my husband. that man. neither of us will ever forget this moment, right here. #jonathangetsyounger #firstlook | 📷 @tynandaniels @viaimagery
user_12;user_12182.jpg;this moment, my dad walking me down the aisle, as we first laid eyes on our guests - is a moment in time i will remember for as long as i live. as a little girl i dreamt of this moment so long before i ever knew who my groom would be, but i always knew who would be right by my side. my dad. my fellow reflector. the one who pushes me and challenges me and in every sense, reflects me back to myself. daddy, thank you for making this wedding possible and making me who i am. for being the life of every party and for traveling through eons of lifetimes with me. i will FOREVER be your little girl. can we freeze this moment in time forever? #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12183.jpg;i wanted to feel like an ethereal mermaid goddess at our wedding and that’s exactly how i felt in every moment. my intention was to be wildly present, to spread contagious loving energy & sparks of magic, and to bask in the glow of the most love and support we’ve ever felt in our lives. and to share some epic vows with my husband. it was everything we wanted & dreamed of, except 2011111x better. #jonathangetsyounger | 📷 @tynandaniels @viaimagery
user_12;user_12184.jpg;MR. & MRS. ALBRECHT! 11.02.19, a day that will forever be cemented in our hearts as the most magical, love filled, cloud nine billion day of our lives. i cannot wait to spend eternity with you, MY HUSBAND!! #jonathangetsyounger | 📷 @tynandaniels @viaimagery
user_12;user_12185.jpg;last night’s rehearsal magic 💫 cannot wait to become your wife today, MY LOVE!!!! let’s do this! #jonathangetsyounger

user_12;user_12187.jpg;because everyone needs a little sos-free cookie dough chocolate chip muffin action before their wedding am i right 😏 these are my faves of all time and i love seeing you guys remake them. they’re fully vegan 🌱 and as fluffy as can be. on that note, i was thinking tonight about being plant based and how much it means to me. eating this way has given me my freedom back with food- i feel amazing in my body leading up to our wedding and i haven’t changed a thing. getting wedding ready for me has simply been living my life. this is my everyday lifestyle and i love it. AND i get to eat decadent #vegan treats like this every day so... 🍫 win win?!

user_12;user_12188.jpg;channeling feeling amazing on our wedding day no matter what 💫 in many ways my health is not feelin’ great this week, but i’m not letting it get me down because my cup runs over with gratitude. and love. & i refuse to dwell on it and put it further into the universe, bc i know this weekend will be everything and more with this boy by my side! i am visualizing all of the health & telling myself what i know to be true- “i am healthy. i am healing. health and healing are mine to have.” a huge THANK YOU to my boy for simply being exactly who he is. and most of all for asking me to be his wife. 👰🏼 & if you’re sick too and planning a wedding- i see you. it will all turn out perfectly and magically just as it should. i know it. 💗 #jonathangetsyounger
user_12;user_12189.jpg;tonight at the end of an intense lyme treatment i looked at jonathan with an IV still in my arm and said, “can we go to the beach?” and off we went. 👫 we danced around like little kids and the pain flooded from my body and the earth re-centered and grounded me. i knew that if i could just ground my feet in the sand & feel the cool breeze against my skin it would give me just what i needed. it would remind me how good it feels to be alive, even in all this pain. there is nothing, NOTHING like a magnificent electric orange sunset over the beautiful mama ocean waters. it revived me, big time. some days it’s hard to be a human but on those days especially i am so grateful for this beautiful earth we get to call home. 🌎 #soulonfire #lymewarrior #lymedontkillmyvibe
user_12;user_12190.jpg;you can’t pour from an empty cup. i’ve been filling my own cup way, way up these last few days and it has felt so good. 💫 even small breaks from technology to be immersed in nature, spend time with our loves, go inward, and get true, real rest are so important and so healing. this weekend all i did was sleep and rest and read and do yoga and get massages 💆🏼 and it was so, so perfect. 💫 as we flow into our WEDDING WEEK (🙈🙈🙈) i keep these truths close to my heart. it is my intention to be fully present and to soak in the love in every moment. to remember what our wedding is truly about, which is joining forces with my best friend for the rest of our LIVES!! 💫 how was your weekend? any last wedding tips for me? i am so excited and so ready... let’s do this thing! #jonathangetsyounger #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #lymewarrior

user_12;user_12194.jpg;ANXIETY TIPS! 🌺 with our wedding 12 short days away (!!) & still dealing with chronic illness, i’ve been feeling a raging bout of anxiety lately. anyone who has planned a wedding knows, even though it’s a thrilling time these last two weeks are just nuts! and i’m trying to heal from lyme/chronic pain/co infections! today i thought my head was going to explode so here is what i did... 1. GOT OUTSIDE. 🌲 SMELLED SOME FLOWERS. 🌸 LET THE FRESH AIR REVIVE ME. nature, even in cities, is so healing. 2. yoga!!!! movement is huge. it shifts our bodies into an entirely different state and let’s that anxiety FLOW through rather than get stuck! hot yoga today was everything i needed & more. 💪🏼 3. meditation 🧘🏼‍♀️ i know it can be the last thing you want to do in an anxiety tailspin, but closing your eyes and breathing for even just 3-5 minutes (or more) can make a world of difference. 4. think of at least one thing you’re grateful for and focus on that. write it down. tape it to your computer screen if you need to or your forehead (lol). let that remind you to be at peace. 5. create a mantra. repeat it to yourself when you feel anxious. mine is “everything is working out, the universe is guiding me, and i am right on time.” what did i miss?! nourishment and community are huge too. and what i am grateful for today is YOU GUYS & YOGA & FRESH AIR. what are you grateful for? 💗🌸🌲🌺 #soulonfire #12days #jonathangetsyounger #lymewarrior
user_12;user_12195.jpg;i got a lot of clarity while i was away this weekend and promised myself i would get back to sharing more recipes with you guys. i go in and out of recipe sharing because i feel like my meals can be so simple and not the most EXCITING (i.e. not layered mason jars overflowing with chunks and toppings and whatnot), but i also feel like sharing how one truly eats is so important. the SOS-free plant-based 🌱 life brings me so much JOY and also eating simple for my digestion has helped me tons- so why not share that more?! that was after all how TBV started in 2013.. my passion for food! so here is my current favorite morning smoothie... 🍫 CHOCOLATE VANILLA SHAKE MORNING SMOOOTHAY! 🍫 • 1 cup unsweetened vanilla flax mylk • 1/3 cup water • 1/2 cup ice • 1 handful frozen coconut chunks • 1 tbsp cacao powder • 1 big scoop vanilla plant protein (right now i’m liking one from we care spa in palm springs!) • TONS OF CINNAMON! • optional- 1 date if you do well with food combining (i don’t so i wait to have my fruit a few hours after this meal) do you guys want to see more simple recipes like this?! if so... tell me below and feel free to make requests! i’m feeling a ‘what i eat in a day’ series again- leave a 💗🙌🏻 if you’d want that!!!! happy monday! #tbbmademedoit #soulonfire #tbbkitchen #lymewarrior #vegansmoothie
user_12;user_12196.jpg;a weekend full of saunas, colonics, cupping, juicing, and massages 💆🏼 aka a weekend in TBB heaven. when i say this is my happiest place on earth, i am so serious! for someone who lives with chronic inflammation, a detox spa is a dream. and palm springs is pure magic. so grateful to be here with my mama for our mini bachelorette getaway 💫 what have you all been up to this weekend? #soulonfire #tbbmademedoit #tbbtravels #lymewarrior
user_12;user_12197.jpg;it’s officially been a year and a half since i started getting treatment for lyme disease 🤯 and so much has changed. i am still fighting this battle but i feel mentally stronger. i still feel full body pain every moment of the day but i see a light at the end of the tunnel. my energy is returning and even if there’s a long way to go that simple glorious fact is not lost on me. today i received a ketamine IV for an hour and a half and experienced the ultimate bliss i’ve ever known - not because i’m healed, but because i have changed. i know who i am. i saw visions of my soul wrapped in white light. i felt connected to the source energy within me that is healing me in every moment of every day. my purpose is clear. my soul is awake. i am me again, more me than ever before. thank you. to all who have been with me on this battle and shown me love, strength, understanding. i see you and i love you wholly. ✌🏻 #lymewarrior #lymedisease #lymedontkillmyvibe #lymediseaseawareness
