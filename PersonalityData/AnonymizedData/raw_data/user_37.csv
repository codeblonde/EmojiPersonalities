user_37;user_370.jpg;Vegan Gluten Free Vanilla Cupcakes!! Perfectly soft, fluffy and sweet topped with a light coconut cream frosting. And they’re ez pz to make in 1-bowl with just 9 ingredients! ⁣ ⁣ Snag the recipe via link in bio! 👉🏻 https://user_37.com/vegan-gluten-free-vanilla-cupcakes/⁣ ⁣ Recipe development process: ⁣ ⁣ Yesterday I posted a quick story on banana muffins with certain gf flours and I had a lot of feedback asking how I came up with the ratio, how to bake with gf flours etc so I thought I’d share recipe development for some recipes :) ⁣ ⁣ This was probably the most finicky and trickiest recipe to develop because of how simple yet delicate vanilla cupcakes are flavour and texture wise. There’s a reason why chocolate cakes are easier to make and more forgiving, but for vanilla cakes anything weird WILL be noticed. ⁣ ⁣ If you’ve ever seen any of my muffin/cupcake recipes, you’ll notice I always go back to my fav combo of oat flour, almond flour and some kind of starch. But for these, because vanilla is the main flavour I used almond flour, rice flour and potato starch. ⁣ ⁣ First I played around with oat flour, apple sauce, aquafaba, brown rice flour, tapioca starch, corn starch, cashew butter etc but they didn’t meet the expectations and either tasted too strong in their flavour or texture was off. Here’s what the end team looks like: ⁣ ⁣ ▪️Almond flour: gives a rich and buttery flavour and texture without any added butter/oil⁣ ▪️Rice flour: is super light and helps with the density of almond flour and also gives it that nice slight chew texture missing from gf flours ⁣ ▪️ Potato starch: makes it extra light and helps bind ⁣ ⁣ Then we have a bit of coconut yogurt to replace the eggs and add moisture, cane sugar for sweetness and baking soda + baking powder to make sure they rise. ⁣ ⁣ I also added in some tips and tricks for perfect flat top cupcakes perfect for frosting ☺️ I hope you guys enjoy this one!! ⁣

user_37;user_373.jpg;New ✨ Strawberry Lemon Snacking Cake! Snacking cakes are the best kinda cakes: easy to make in 1 bowl and with 1 plan— no fussy cutting or layering necessary. Also wanted to share three ingredients I’ve been loving to bake with: ⁣ ⁣ 1️⃣ Tofu: one of my all time favourite ingredients ever (not only for savory dishes)!! It keeps cakes and cupcakes super moist and bakes up super fluffy. Silken tofu is what you want so it’s not dense— I also experimented eith light coconut yogurt which produces similar results. ⁣ ⁣ 2️⃣ Potato starch: produces cakes way less gummier than tapioca and corn starch and gives a nice tender crumb. ⁣ ⁣ 3️⃣ Coconut condensed milk: for cakes and breads especially, it gives this super milky flavour. I also experimented using half cane sugar and half lite coconut milk for similar results. ⁣ ⁣ If you haven’t tried baking with these ingredients yet, this recipe is a easy way to start 😋⁣ ⁣ Snag the recipe link in my bio! 👉🏻 https://user_37.com/strawberry-lemon-snacking-cake/

user_37;user_3710.jpg;I will be muting my feed from June 1-7 to #amplifymelanatedvoices that need to be heard most. Head to the creators @jessicawilson.msrd & @blackandembodied for more info. #asiansforblacklives
user_37;user_3711.jpg;I always have a hard time finding words, especially the right words when speaking up about what is going on in our society. But regarding recent events (and has been doing on) and the flawed justice system it felt SO WRONG not to say anything. My heart has been feeling heavy the past couple of days and I've typed out drafts and drafts about what I wanted to say and how to say it 'right' and to each, I've wondered if what I'm saying is enough. ⁣ I took a step back from social media today and I've realized IT IS NOT the time to try and come up with the perfect speech and continue to prolong the silence. I'm not an expert, but I am educating myself more and more and my goal is to pass that along. ⁣ -⁣ What I really want to shine light on:⁣ I am not white, but not being white should not be a an excuse to sit back, watch and be ignorant in situations of injustice. Us non-black POC have to do better and need to support black people. How? Educate, share, talk, protest, donate and stand up for what is right. ⁣ I learned a lot from the resources @mimizhuxiyuan posted(thank you @veganeatsnyc + @sweetsimplevegan for sharing this too). I urge you to take a look, educate yourself and learn more and where you can help contribute.⁣ -⁣ Edit: The moment went back on instagram, I came across a comment saying that they're tired of hearing about this news. If you're tired of seeing these posts and hearing about racism, please take a second and just think about how sick people are of experiencing it first hand every day. ⁣ So, enough silence, inaction and ignorance. ⁣ — Art by: @lettersfrom4th, @mimizhuxyuan, @coolbeenart

user_37;user_3719.jpg;Cereously this is kinda cute. But I also don't really know how to eat this. Do I pour milk in it? Won't it get soggy? 😂 I decided to try it with waffles because they're waaaaay crispier. ⁣ ⁣ Were they good? Well yeah, it's mini waffles!! Plus doesn't take much time at all since I just cut them into squares but admittedly kinda fun to eat and I only need one hand. ⁣ ⁣ I used my go-to waffle recipe that I've stuck to since going vegan, they kinda taste like eggo-- superrrr crispy! Here's the recipe for those of you that asked (the same larger one in my story):⁣ ⁣ Ingredients (for 2 large waffles)⁣ 2/3 cup non dairy milk (160ml // I like using lite canned coconut milk makes it richer)⁣ 1 tsp apple cider vinegar⁣ 2 tbsp maple syrup (40g)⁣ 1 tbsp tahini (15g)⁣ 2 tsp vanilla⁣ 1/2-1 tsp almond extract (optional) ⁣ 3/4 cup oat flour + 2 tbsp oat flour (100g)⁣ 2 tbsp corn starch (15g)⁣ 2 tsp baking powder⁣ 1/4 cup blueberries (optional)⁣ 2 tbsp chocolate chips (optional) ⁣ ⁣ Method:⁣ Combine almond milk and ACV together and let it sit for 3 minutes. Whisk in maple syrup, tahini, vanilla extract and almond extract. Sift in oat flour, corn starch and baking powder. Stir with chopsticks or fork until just combined. Then use a spatula and scrape the sides of the bowl inwards 1-2 times. Let the batter sit for 5 ish minutes. In the mean time, pre-heat waffle iron to medium. Add in the batter and cook for 4-5 ish minutes or until you can lift the waffle iron up without it breaking in half. Then cut them into bite sized pieces or eat as is. ⁣ ⁣ Hot waffle tip: place waffles on a cooling rack so that they don't get soggy :) You can also freeze these!

user_37;user_3740.jpg;Hiya 👋🏻. ⁣ ⁣ I’ve been sitting here for 20 minutes trying to caption this post for a recipe I scheduled to post 2 weeks ago but forgot about it in all the noise the first week of this whole situation. ⁣ ⁣ Truthfully my heart hasn’t been here and I feel like I’ve just been forcing my captions and appearance on social media the past 2 weeks. ⁣ ⁣ On top of all of this, I have a lot of family issues that I’ve never really shared that have just gotten worse having everyone at home... all day everyday and it’s been exhausting.⁣ ⁣ My heart is still heavy, its lonely, I’m having a hard time adjusting, I don’t know how to work, when to work and what is appropriate or not— and I question if I’m being insensitive if I do this or that. Its just been messy. I tried to get my shit together this week but it honestly just didn’t happen. ⁣ ⁣ I know everyone is in the same boat and I get frustrated at myself for complaining when I have a roof over my head, food to eat and a very cute subie to love— knowing some people are struggling way more... but it’s just hard. ⁣ ⁣ Okay, I’m actually walking outside as I type this and my hands are freezing and my mind is in a tornado right now and I really don’t know where I’m going with this post— like it’s a picture of coconut crusted tofu!! what am I doing but this might be the most real caption I’ve ever typed out in the past 3 weeks. I’m sorry if I’m not making any sense but if you’re feeling this way, I’m right here with ya. I’m telling myself it’s okay to feel the way I’m feeling and I just want you to know it’s okay too!! It’s human. It would be ?? If we didn’t feel this way. If any of you ever want to chat or even have a meal together virtually... hit me up I’d love to have some company 😌⁣ ⁣ And... wow so what this post was supposed to be about was a new recipe that just went live on the blog for this mega crispy coconut crusted tofu that is highly delicious.

Looking back, 2019 was a better year. It was a good year. I got to take my boyfriend to Japan, to my grandmas place. I graduated from university.

user_37;user_3790.jpg;One of my goals in 2019 was to become a better plant based baker... and I am so pumped to finally share a Vegan Macaron recipe on the blog!! 🎉😭 !! On the last day of 2019 too !! ⁣ ⁣ I used to make regular macarons with my mom for school fundraisers, parties and friends gifts so they were something I really did miss making.⁣ ⁣ I’ve been testing vegan macarons since I think around May and after 30+ batches later I found the right ratios, oven temps, waiting times and folding techniques that worked for me. ⁣ ⁣ Macarons are ready very temperamental. Vegan macarons are even more temperamental. Even with the right ingredients to the T you probably won’t get it your first try. It’s really trial and error and figuring out what works best with your oven and kitchen temperature. ⁣ ⁣ If you’re really keen on making vegan macarons do not give up!! They are possible and when you actually get it, it’s SO satisfying... just like anything in life 😛 ⁣ ⁣ Ready to make your own vegan macarons??

He goes off to work and I'll go for a walk with Subie which usually tires her out. ⁣ ⁣ Then I get to enjoy a super cozy bowl of oatmeal. My body is slowly transitioning back to craving oats and @naturespathorganic has been helping out with that 😂 #ad. Their instant oats are gluten free and their maple brown sugar was my go to back in the day when I was in uni cause it was the easiest to customize. ⁣ ⁣ I know instant oats kinda have a bad rep *guys I know.. I was in uni before too* but!! After a year of dorm food, I figured out how to actually make it taste good and now I love the consistency of instant oats! Plus, they're super convenient.⁣ ⁣ How to Make Perfect Instant Oatmeal *Taste ~Fancy~*⁣ 1. Use hot cashew or oat milk instead of water. Seriously. It's actually creamy! + after its done cooking, add a bit more on top to keep it from drying out. ⁣ 2. Add in 1-2 tbsp of whole rolled oats. It adds more body and texture! ⁣ 3. Add in fresh and/or dried fruit! It makes it sweeter + more textures.⁣ 4. Add whole nuts or seeds for texture⁣ 5. Add a generous dallop of nut or seed butter, for more creaminess & texture⁣ 6. Optional: if you're feeling extra fancy throw on some chocolate chips, drizzle maple syrup and dash on some cinnamon just cause 😜⁣ ⁣ And you're on your way to a hearty cozy bowl of oats! ⁣ ⁣ Share with me your fav combo of oats below, I wanna know!!

user_37;user_37180.jpg;QUESTION: What are your baking woes? ⁣ ⁣ For me, it was gummy un-even baking in quick breads & muffins 😩. You know when you think it’s cooked but you cut into it and you can see obvious raw density either at the top or bottom? Or when you bite into it and it’s not bread-like at all (especially with gluten-free & oil free baking)? ⁣ ⁣ After many (MANY x100) attempts at baking quick breads, I think I’ve learned the correct ratios + a lot of tips and tricks along the way to achieve moist + fluffy BUT NOT DENSE AND GUMMY quick breads. It really depends on the main ingredient used but now that I figured out what works and what doesn’t, it only takes me 2-3 recipe tests vs 10+ (I use a base recipe and adjust accordingly).⁣ ⁣ I’m going to be doing a Quick Bread 101 blog post in the near future so I’d love to know what you struggle with so I can try to cover things people have the most struggle with! Comment ‘em down below 👇🏻 ⁣

The name is fitting eh? 😂 I was told that the reason why it’s pink white green in this order is because the flowers start as a pink bud, into a white flower and then into green leaves 🍃 ⁣ ⁣ Dango is one of my fav Japanese desserts. Do you know what the difference is between mochi and dango? Dango is made from 100% rice or sweet rice flour whereas mochi is made from pounding whole rice that then gets steamed.⁣ ⁣ For this Hanami Dango recipe I incorporated my grandmas secret ingredient to get a super bouncy-tender-chewy-mochi-mochi type texture, it’s a ingredient I always have on hand and it’s high in protein 👀!!⁣ ⁣ Dango is super duper easy to make so I hope you try this simple beautiful dango recipe out! 🍡💗 ⁣ ⁣ Full recipe linked in the bio! 👉🏻 https://user_37.com/hanami-dango/⁣
