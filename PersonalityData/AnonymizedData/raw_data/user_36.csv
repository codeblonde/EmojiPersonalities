user_36;user_3638.jpg;What DOES a vegan eat in a day? 🌮🥗🍔🍨 I’ve been having so much fun singing and grooving on @tiktok over the past two months and I finally got around to making a #whatieatinaday video!⠀ ⠀ WHAT I EAT IN A DAY VEGAN + GLUTEN FREE:⠀ -Fresh Celery + Apple Juice⠀ -Big Lunch of Pinto Bean + @beyondmeat Beef Tostadas⠀ -Snack of @hippeas_snacks⠀ -Tons of H2O All Day⠀ -Post-Workout Burger Taco Spinach Salad⠀ -Chocolate Ice Cream from @so_delicious⠀ ⠀ Since I practice #intermittentfasting I typically feast between the hours of 1PM-6PM. Intermittent Fasting has totally changed my body + mind because it’s taught me to listen to just how much food my body needs to thrive! If you are struggling with heath, overeating, under-eating or are just wanting to find your body’s balance, TRY Intermittent Fasting.⠀ ⠀ 💕Seriously, Intermittent Fasting and eating #plantbased cured me from all those nasty lingering bulimic thoughts and tendencies just by allowing myself to feast without guilt or “fear” of eating the wrong things. Plants heal! ⠀ ⠀ 👩🏽‍🍳Looking for more flavortastic recipes and soulful sounds?⠀ ⠀ GET MORE COLORFUL RECIPES AND SONGS HERE: http://www.youtube.com/user_36 ⠀ ⠀ SING ALONG WITH ME ON TIKTOK HERE: https://vm.tiktok.com/coXedL/⠀ ⠀ MUSICAL LIVE-STREAMING COOKING CLASS WITH ONE GREAT VEGAN⠀ EVERY SATURDAY AT 1PM CST⠀ TIKTOK LIVE + FACEBOOK LIVE + INSTAGRAM LIVE⠀ ⠀ 🔥ALL RECIPE LINKS IN MY BIO⠀ ⠀ #user_36 #veganchef #veganrecipes #vegan #plantbased #healthyrecipes #soulfood #cookingshow #vegancookingshow #vegancooking #sing #veganrecipeshare #plantprotein #veganrecipe #soulfood #singingchef #vegansinger #recipe #healthy #musicalcooking #Musical #glutenfree #plantsheal #eatingdisorderrecovery #healing

user_36;user_3668.jpg;NEW VIDEO! 🎥 How do I Drink #CeleryJuice Every Day? (YOUTUBE LINK IN THE BIO!)⠀ ⠀ 🥬 Real talk though, now is the perfect time to start drinking celery juice on the daily to help keep your immune system strong.⠀ ⠀ My loves, you all KNOW my obsession with celery juice is real and every day that I drink this green magic I feel alive and renewed! Inspired by @medicalmedium and inspiring my friends and family to start drinking this green goodness has seriously become a passion of mine because I feel the positive affects of fresh celery juice on the daily!⠀ ⠀ Benefits of Celery Juice:⠀ -Activates the gut for better digestion⠀ -Natural anti-inflammatory⠀ -Aids the Liver⠀ -Fights infections⠀ -Promotes Cardiovascular Health⠀ -Skin healing⠀ -Improves sleep and mental clarity⠀ -Clears up skin⠀ -Hydrating⠀ ⠀ I suggest investing in a juicer (I bought one at Target made by Hamilton Beach for $60 and it’s lasted me 7 years!) and juice 1 full stalk of celery + 1 big pink lady apple 5 times a week. I also like to drink it first thing in the morning because I’ve found that it helps keep me full and energized until I dive into a huge plant-based lunch around 1PM.⠀ ⠀ If you are looking for a inexpensive way to keep the doctor away TRY CELERY JUICE. Oh! And don’t forget to get your groove on when you are juicing this magic green drank.⠀ ⠀ 🎶 Celery juice, celery juice, I’m drinkin’ me some celery juice!⠀ ⠀ 👩🏽‍🍳 Looking for flavortastic recipes that help you get your glow on? 🎶 You can find music-infused recipes and live-lyrical classes on my YouTube Channel: One Great Vegan ⠀ ⠀ 🎥 http://Youtube.Com/user_36⠀ ⠀ 👉🏼 YOUTUBE LINK IN THE BIO⠀ ⠀ #user_36 #celeryjuicebenefits #youtube #veganyoutuber #vegan #plantbased #freshjuice #freshpressed #juice #veganyoutube #vegancookingshow #vegancookingclass #musicalcookingshow #veganchef ⠀ ⠀

user_36;user_36127.jpg;✨How do you get your #GLOW on? To glow means to find overall health and peace within yourself and share that glow by being an example of love. ⠀ ⠀ ✨Well, actually it goes a bit deeper than that. When I was 17 years old I was confronted with the reality that life is short and that mental illness runs rampant in my family. At that moment I had to make a choice:⠀ 1. Wallow in the tragedy and let that darkness consume the rest of my life.⠀ 2. Find light through the pain by accepting my illnesses, insecurities, and past abuse.⠀ ⠀ ✨I chose to accept my truth. No matter how ugly, wicked, and sick my birth mother’s mind was, and despite how crippling the fear that I too could have bipolar schizophrenia, I made the choice to accept that mental illness was a part of me and I would not let that illness define my life as Gabrielle Reyes.⠀ ⠀ ✨By finding peace with my past, discovering the healing power of eating plants, and discovering the joy of an honest sexual relationship I feel that glow more and more everyday and strive to dig deeper within my self everyday!⠀ ⠀ ✨So, how DO you get your glow on?⠀ 1. Strive for mental health and wellness through truth.⠀ 2. Heal your body with plants and a variety of colors.⠀ 3. Aim for sexual health and honesty in all relationships. ⠀ ✨Try out these three tips and let me know how you feel when you open your life to truth, possibilities, and overall health! ⠀ ⠀ 📷 Photo by @aceshotthat ⠀ ⠀ #user_36 #getyourglowon #mentalhealthawareness⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #mentalhealth #vegan #plantsheal #healthandwellness #veganchef #plantbased #plantpowered #romance #ruth #relationships #vegans #veganactress #vegancookingshow #veganglow #veganlife #healing #wordsofwisdom #veganbody #vegangoals #vegancooking #cookingshow #vegancookingclass

user_36;user_36158.jpg;Going #ZEROWASTE one day at a time! 🌏 Today I’m trying out a new way to clean my mason jars that I adore using for #sustainable storage and of course for, my big glasses of daily fresh celery juice! 💚⠀ ⠀ 💥 So, I was doing a bit of deep cleaning and I just discovered a fabulous way to remove that pesky glue that gets stuck to glass jars under the sticker. ⠀ ⠀ 🍊 ORANGE GOO-GONE RECIPE ⠀ -1 Part Melted Coconut Oil⠀ -2 Parts Baking Soda⠀ -1 Tsp Orange Essential Oil⠀ ⠀ ✨ Now mix that baby up! Make sure the mixture is thick like a paste and stick the Orange Goo-Gone onto the spot where the glue is stuck. Let the mixture sit on the jar overnight. Wash off the mixture with a sponge, warm soap, and water and get a sparkling clean, ready to fill with goodies! ⠀ ⠀ 🌿 Every year we made it our goal to use less and less waste and choose glass/wood/metal over plastic containers. It’s been challenging but overall a fun learning experience!⠀ ⠀ 👩🏽‍🍳 Looking for helpful tips and epic food that helps you get your glow on?

user_36;user_36160.jpg;💚Celery Juice keeps you feeling SEXY! Have you tried fresh celery juice yet? ⠀ ⠀ ✨My loves, you all KNOW my obsession with #celeryjuice is real and every day that I drink this green magic I feel alive and renewed! Inspired by @medicalmedium and inspiring my friends and family to start drinking this green goodness has seriously become a passion of mine because I feel the positive affects of fresh celery juice on the daily!⠀ ⠀ 🍃 Benefits of Celery Juice:⠀ -Activates the gut for better digestion⠀ -Natural anti-inflammatory⠀ -Aids the Liver⠀ -Fights infections⠀ -Promotes Cardiovascular Health⠀ -Skin healing⠀ -Improves sleep and mental clarity⠀ -Clears up skin⠀ -Hydrating⠀ ⠀ ✌🏼 I suggest investing in a juicer (I bought one at @target for $70 and it’s lasted me 7 years!) and juice 1 full stalk of celery + 1 big pink lady apple 5 times a week. I also like to drink it first thing in the morning because I’ve found that it helps keep me full and energized until I dive into a huge plant-based lunch around 1PM.⠀ ⠀ 💚 If you are looking for a inexpensive way to keep the doctor away TRY CELERY JUICE. Oh! And don’t forget to get your groove on when you are juicing this magic green drank.⠀ ⠀ 🎶 Celery juice, celery juice, I’m drinkin’ me some celery juice! 🎵⠀ ⠀ 👩🏽‍🍳 Looking for flavortastic food that helps you get your glow on?

user_36;user_36181.jpg;When you are cooking colorful you are cooking GREAT! 🌈⠀ ⠀ One of my best bits of advise for people who ask me how to go vegan is to EAT THE RAINBOW. It’s best to always base the majority of your diet around colorful whole foods and then add in whatever fried, battered, and buttered treats you want to spice up your #plantbased meal! When you are eating a multitude of plant-based colors your body is soaking up all the nutrients that make those ingredients so vibrant. It also helps that veggies, fruits and herbs are so dang tasty too! 🍠🥑🍎🍇🧅🥦🌽⠀ ⠀ 👩🏽‍🍳 Looking for flavortastic recipes full of color?

user_36;user_36184.jpg;@spiraldiner in DFW. 🍔 Who else had their first vegan experience at this classic spot? 🙋🏽‍♀️⠀ ⠀ 💕 When I was 11 years old I came to Spiral for the first time with my dad after a anime convention in Fort Worth. I remember tucking into a stacked veggie sandwich while my father feasted on a big bowl of the soup of the day.⠀ ⠀ Flash forward 17 years and I have a soft spot in my heart for Spiral because every time I walk through their vibrant doors I’m reminded of my father and how proud he is of me as he watches from the stars.⠀ ⠀ That, and they also make some BOMB Buffalo Chikn’ Nachos! 😋⠀ ⠀ 🎶 Keep your ears perked up because I think that @the_michael_childs + @ayanna_rose_ + I may also have a Spiral Jingle in the works. 👀⠀ ⠀ #user_36 #dfwvegan #dallasvegan #vegannachos

user_36;user_36197.jpg;🌿 GREEN glorious green! My obsession with #celeryjuice has been going on for 9 months now and I feel like a changed woman. And my Song of Celery Juice is the JAM y’all! 🎵⠀ ⠀ 🌱 Honestly, when I first heard about drinking celery juice for your health I thought it was just another fad cleanse that sounded like A LOT of work that I wasn’t willing to commit to consistently. 🍎 But, the first time I added a big pink lady apple into my celery juice it changed the game. 😍 The sweetness of the apple gives the drink a light, refreshing, and tasty flavor that cuts the earthy flavor of the celery.⠀ ⠀ 🍃 Benefits of Celery Juice:⠀ -Activates the gut for better digestion⠀ -Natural anti-inflammatory⠀ -Aids the Liver⠀ -Fights infections⠀ -Promotes Cardiovascular Health⠀ -Skin healing⠀ -Improves sleep and mental clarity⠀ -Hydrating⠀ ⠀ ✌🏼 I suggest investing in a juicer (I bought one at @target for $70 and it’s lasted me 7 years!) and juice 1 full stalk of celery + 1 big pink lady apple 5 times a week. I also like to drink it first thing in the morning because I’ve found that it helps keep me full and energized until I dive into a huge plant-based lunch around 1PM.⠀ ⠀ 💚 If you are looking for a inexpensive way to keep the doctor away TRY CELERY JUICE. Oh! And don’t forget to get your groove on when you are juicing this magic green drank.⠀ ⠀ 🎶 Celery juice, celery juice, I’m drinkin’ me some celery juice! 🎵⠀ #user_36 #veganrecipes #celeryjuicebenefits⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #celeryjuiceheals #celeryjuicechallenge #getyourglowon #medicalmedium #freshjuice @celeryjuicebenefits @celeryjuiceheals @medicalmedium
