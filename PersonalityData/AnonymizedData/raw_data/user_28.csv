user_28;user_281.jpg;Boy did this mama need a night out! #andwine #andchampagne 😂🥂🙏Thank you to the amazing @tastecanadaawards team. Monday night’s gala was such a fun celebration of Canada’s culinary writers. 🇨🇦🇨🇦 I can’t tell you how grateful I am to be a part of this passionate (and hilarious) group. I left the gala feeling inspired by so many great convos with new and old friends. . . I’m still in disbelief over receiving two gold awards, one for Health and Special Diets Cookbook of the year (Oh She Glows Every Day!), and a second honouring Oh She Glows as best Health and Special Diets Food Blog 2017. This year has been a trying one, and I’ve struggled with self-doubt as I try to find some sort of balance between motherhood and my career. The recognition is so meaningful and reminds me to keep going. We are often too hard on ourselves, especially in a creative field. I’m so grateful to be a part of this community, and can’t believe how much you have all changed my life. ❤️ . . I’d like to give a shoutout and a big congrats to all the winners! @jckfoodgirl, @frankferragine, @adashofvegan, @guylaine_guevremont_muula_ , @catlefebvre, @chefjameswalt, @earlsrestaurant, @mariloubiz, @samueljoubert, Naomi Duguid, @hotthaikitchen, Racha Bassoul, @realbiondino, @matfoulidz, @a_born_baker, @chefannaolson, @epicesdecru, @lfmchef, Nettie Cronish and Cara Rosenblum, Stephanie Cote, @mariannedez, @diversivore, and @kitchenhealssoul!!

user_28;user_282.jpg;"NEW on the blog...Ultimate flourless brownies for TWO (vegan + grain-free), a revamp of the ones in #osgeveryday and just in time for 🎃🎃🙀I'm also dishing some exciting cookbook news! . When I told Eric about this recipe revamp he said, ""Why would you ever want to make fewer servings of brownies? It just doesn't make sense."" He kills me. And I had no decent rebuttal. 🤷🏼‍♀️ . Link in profile! It's also live in the app. 📲"
user_28;user_283.jpg;I was being nice this time and gave Eric the bigger salad... . JUST KIDDING 🤣 . You can find this easy nut-free taco salad recipe in my app (available on iOS and 'droid). The taco crumble is an incredible mix of roasted/salted pepitas, sundried tomatoes, garlic, chili powder, etc. 👌makes for a great salad topping, especially paired with my creamy hummus dressing and all the fixins' 🥑🍅🥒
user_28;user_284.jpg;Here's a fun way to use Roasted Butternut Squash w/ Pecan Parm leftovers! Warm them up and topple over a big salad. Adding a cozy heated-up component to a salad is a good way to transition them into fall and winter. Stick to the ribs, ya know? 👌And if you're like me and you don't crave salads this time of year, it's an easy way to trick yourself into making them more! I'm all about tricking myself as much as possible 😂🤔 . . I whisked together a speedy dressing made with apple cider vinegar, pure maple syrup, olive oil, Dijon mustard, pink salt, and pepper. Just all to taste. So good! . . Another way to enjoy a hot & cold salad this fall is with my Crowd-Pleasing Tex Mex Casserole (recipe from my first cookbook). Warm it up and add it on a bed of lettuce...then add all kinds of toppings like avocado, salsa, cashew sour cream, green onion, etc. THAT'S HAPPENING TOMORROW with ma leftovers 🤗✅ . Ps - link to the roasted butternut squash recipe is in my profile 👍
user_28;user_285.jpg;(oops, I deleted my videos by mistake so reposting 🤷🏼‍♀️😆) . Last weekend I decided it had been TOO LONG since I made my beloved roasted butternut squash dish, complete with almond-pecan parm...and kale...and lots of garlic. Have you made it? Oh me oh my, it’s a show-stealing side I tell ya. (Making all the other dishes give the side-eye, heh. #butternutplease) . . Here’s a little summary of the comments I received when I served it to the fam: . Eric: Holy sh*t that’s hot!!! *burns mouth* (he never learns) and then “Butternut squash is so much better than pumpkin” (LOL...so random….I die) .  Adriana, 3 years old: NO THANK YOUUUUUUU, as she skips away with Arlo’s toy in her grasp. Spotted 10 minutes earlier: downing a box of “circle crackers” (sigh) . Arlo, 1 year old: *screams and beats his hands in protest because he has to wait for the squash to cool* then proceeds to inhale it. He was nice enough to smash the leftover squash into his hair, and even tossed some squash over his shoulder for good luck. . Me: *screams and beats my hands in protest because I have to wait for it to cool* then eats 2 big servings. 🤣 . . *****MAKE-AHEAD TIP***** . Did you know you can prep this dish a couple days in advance? This is a fun trick for holiday meal prep when sanity is at an all time low (or is that just me). . . Simply chop the squash (I just said “simply” and “chop squash” in the same sentence...#fail) OR get your paws on some pre-chopped fresh butternut at the grocery store (bless their souls)...and throw it into the casserole dish with your oil, garlic, salt, parsley, etc. Wrap the casserole dish with foil and let it hang out in the fridge for a couple days, if you’re doing that make-ahead thang. Chop the kale (this time I doubled the amount and loved the extra greens!!) and put it in a tiny container or baggie in the fridge, as well as the almond-pecan parmesan. (Pro tip: you can make this “vegan parm” will all kinds of nuts and seeds...this time I used almonds and roasted/salted pepitas...it also works without the nutritional yeast, just in case you don’t have it on hand! I change it up all the time). Put that in the fridge too. Cook when ready
user_28;user_286.jpg;These are my go-to vegan chocolate cupcakes 🤗 They're the perfect cupcake for all of your celebration needs, and they never last long at a party (or decked out alongside an Easter spread, maybe?). You won't believe it when you see how much they rise while baking...fluffy cake for days, lol. I top them with a layer of salted buttercream (which I’d like to eat with a spoon all on its own...okay, maybe I do...), and sprinkles because sprinkles are life and festive as ffffffffffff. ✨👯 The full recipe is available on user_28.com (direct link in profile) and it’s also in The Oh She Glows Recipe App.
user_28;user_287.jpg;"Ultimate Green Taco Wraps—for #meatlessmonday and #tacotuesday! Get ready to pack a ton of plants into your meal. If you haven't tried my lentil-walnut taco meat, this is a great recipe to give ‘er a go with; it's high in protein 💪, and the taco seasonings and chewy texture create a scrumptious-tasting taco “meat”. Lettuce wraps make this recipe grain-free, but feel free to use tortilla wraps or warm corn shells (love!) to change it up, or you can make this recipe into a big salad, too. Snag the recipe on user_28.com (direct link in profile), and you’ll also find it in the app and book #2. If you try it out (or have tried it out), be sure to leave a comment and let us know how it went! 😎😋"
user_28;user_288.jpg;Chili Cheese Nachos—made vegan! In my past life, I loved digging into a big ol’ plate of chili cheese nachos from a popular fast food joint. (And I washed it down with a shake, of course.) 😊My version has a decadent-tasting combo of luxurious vegan cheese sauce and smoky lentil and kidney bean chili, and it’s vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free (with a nut-free option to boot.) Nope, I don’t miss the old one a darn bit. 🤗 The full recipe is available in the #osgeveryday cookbook, and psst...you can also find it on @clean.plates and @honest blogs. Let me know if any of you have tried it out! If you like the video, don’t forget to visit the link in my Insta profile to subscribe to our YouTube channel.

user_28;user_289.jpg;✨Our 6-ingredient Hunky Heartbeet Cabbage Soup is going to make you GLOW! ✨Turn the music up and get groovin’. This borscht-inspired soup is vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free, and it’s jam-packed with feel-good ingredients. The recipe is available on www.user_28.com and in our app. See the link in my Insta profile to subscribe to our re-launched YouTube channel so you never miss a new video! 🎥 .  Before I go, I’d like to share a couple reviews from OSG readers just in case you need a bit more convincing to try it out. 😚 Lacey S. writes, “I am Polish, and I make borscht ALL the time. This soup is AMAZING!!! It tastes so much like borscht it’s unreal. A lot quicker to make, and obviously meat free... I’ve given tupperware containers full to all my family. Will absolutely be making this again!” Jen F. writes, “...This soup is incredible and super easy really. I made it while my family was away, just in case as they are not beet lovers, and I almost ate the whole thing, so good! I forced my husband to try it, and despite the cringing look on his face as he tasted it (he HATES beets), he then said, “Oh, wow, that’s pretty good!” I can’t wait to make a double batch this week and freeze half of it…” Thank you for the kind words, Lacey & Jen! Happy cooking, everyone. 💪
user_28;user_2810.jpg;I finally got around to sharing our fave 10-minute toddler-friendly pasta recipe on the blog this week! It’s SO EASY for those hectic weeknights when cooking is the last thing you want to do, and it packs in protein, fibre, and healthy fats. I’ve also provided a few ideas on how to change it up (one of my faves is to purée cooked carrot or cauliflower and stir it into the pasta for a nutrient boost). There’s a direct link to the post in my profile, so hop on ova to check it out! 👀😎
user_28;user_2811.jpg;"(A Couple Cooks takeover, 4/4) Bliss bites are one of the most popular recipes on our website, and they happen to be fully plant-based. We've had many people tell us they make a batch and keep them in their refrigerator or freezer for when they need a sweet treat. Made with oats, coconut oil, PB, maple, and cocoa powder, they're one of my personal favorite recipes that we've made. Ever. Thanks so much for following along with this takeover—it's been a blast!

user_28;user_2812.jpg;"(A Couple Cooks takeover, 3/4) Wait, did I already say curry? This one is our absolute FAVE to have for dinner, this time using lentils and a bright green cilantro chutney.

user_28;user_2816.jpg;just realized I forgot to share this cozy soup that I posted to the blog a MONTH ago! Better late than never, right?! 😊 Anyway, I revamped an old blog favourite, my Broccoli and Cheese Soup. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free. I call it a “weekend” soup because it involves a few homemade components (cheese sauce, soup, and homemade croutons), so you’ll need an hour start to finish. It’s a good one to make when there’s a storm outside and you have nowhere to be. 🌨☃🌧 In my post, I’m also talking about some business goals for 2017 and sharing a fave quote for the year. There’s a direct link in my profile, so hop on over to the blog to check it out! 😎
user_28;user_2817.jpg;My kind of Valentine’s Day is easy...simple...no pressure. It’s the little things, you know? This morning, I let Eric sleep in while I took care of the kids and breakfast. Adriana got a small colouring set from us from the Dollarstore. We forgot about Arlo, but I’ll give him extra milk or something. 😂 She spit out the rice crisp treat I made and said “No like it!”. She keeps me humble. 😳 We skipped gifts and exchanged homemade cards from the kids. Well, they were mainly from Adriana, but Arlo might’ve chewed on them a little. Eric is cooking me dinner later tonight and there will likely be one kiddo crying through the entire meal. But I will savour every bite and 🍷. We might save the mess and just order in. It's all good. 🤗 .  This life is messy and imperfect but these 3 are all I could ask for. ❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
user_28;user_2818.jpg;"Jumbo rice crisp heart, anyone? 😍 I made this quick dessert for my Valentines using my Almond Butter Rice Crisp Treats recipe as the base. (I put the link to this recipe in my profile!) My original plan was to make individual hearts using cookie cut-outs, but I only had a few minutes, so I made one big heart. To be honest, I think I love it even more. Adriana was pretty impressed, too. Although, when she took a cautious bite, she made a face and said “no like it”. She’s not a big sweets person and is also sick, so take that review with a grain of salt. 😂😁 . To make it: Spoon the rice crisp mixture onto a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and then lightly wet your hands before pressing it into a heart shape. The hand-wetting is key, or else it will stick like crazy. I also placed a piece of parchment paper on top of the heart and pressed it down to compact it. Chill the heart in the freezer until cold and mostly firm. I topped mine with melted dark chocolate, a pink “chocolate” glaze (made up of melted cacao butter, powdered sugar, almond milk, beet powder, and pink salt...so good!), and a white glaze (powdered sugar, almond milk, and melted coconut oil); unfortunately, I don’t have precise measurements for those as I just winged it. Then I chilled it again until the topping was firm! Slice and enjoy. I recommend making this just before serving it, as the rice crisp tends to dry out as it sits! . Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone. 💕😘🍫"
user_28;user_2819.jpg;"Hello, lover. This borscht-inspired soup is a stunner, from the prep stage (gorgeous shades of plum and violet) to the final end result (a bold crimson red). 😍😳😍 It’s bursting with Vitamin C, iron, and B vitamins, making it a great immune-booster this time of the year.

user_28;user_2825.jpg;I just sat here for a half hour trying to put my immense gratitude into words for this incredible community. It feels impossible to write anything that feels worthy of how I feel about your support and enthusiasm for what we create each year. You all truly mean the world to me...for every recipe you’ve tried, shared, loved, hated...for every time you’ve read my stories or followed along our life changes..for every time you have left a comment or said hello on the street. I often struggle with feeling like I’m not creating enough or making enough of an impact as I try to navigate parenthood with a newborn and toddler, a growing business, and being present through it all. How do I know if I’m doing it right? I’m still learning and f*ing up often and growing and know that “doing it right” means making mistakes, putting the ❤️ in it, and accepting that things will never feel balanced all at once. But I thank you for being there...on the days when I’m on my A-game, and the days when things are quiet and I’m working away behind the scenes. I hope you know that I care about you and I enjoy this all more than you know.  Whether 2016 was your best yet, or one you’d like to leave in your dust (🖕😂), I hope it was touched by the food that I share, bringing comfort and all the 😋😋😋😋 to your days. May 2017 bring peace, happiness, love, health, compassion, more laughter, and some damn delicious food. Happiest new year, everyone ❤️🎉✨
user_28;user_2826.jpg;(Oh, Ladycakes takeover, 5/5) I’m a lover of carbs and would eat pasta for every meal if I could. My go-to pasta dish this time of year is Fettuccine Cashew Alfredo with roasted Brussels sprouts and sautéed mushrooms + peas. The cashew alfredo is super easy to whip up and, lucky for you, the recipe is up on my blog. 🍝 Welp, that’s all from this end. Thanks a million for following along, guys. 💕 — @ohladycakes #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2827.jpg;(Oh, Ladycakes takeover, 4/5) I’m one of those people who prefers to eat something sweet in the middle of the day. It’s usually a few squares of extra dark chocolate or a bowl of coconut whipped cream topped with stewed berries (because I can be pretty dang lazy), but some days I remember I have bag of wholesome treats in the freezer and, just like that, my day is made. These are my Almost Raw Chocolate Chunk Cashew Bites and they’re every bit as good as they look. They can be devoured straight from the freezer and—if you need something warm midday—they pair perfectly with a mug of @nutritionstripped’s golden milk. 🍪✨— @ohladycakes #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2828.jpg;(Oh, Ladycakes takeover, 3/5) Lunch! I know a lot of people like to snack during lunchtime, but I require three solid meals a day or else I turn into a monster (the “hanger” is real, folks). Because I live in a household of two, we almost always have leftovers from the night before—which is great for me because that means lunch requires minimal effort. Today’s lunch is a big bowl of Spicy Peanut Stew with Butternut Squash + Chickpeas (the most popular recipe on my blog), and it is every bit warming and delicious. I like to top it with avocado slices, peanuts, and kale, and I serve it with a side of crispy bread or quinoa. But usually bread because bread is LIFE. 🍞🤘 — @ohladycakes #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2829.jpg;(Oh, Ladycakes takeover, 2/5) By the time 10AM rolls around my stomach is grumbling and I'm ready for second breakfast (and second coffee, too). Depending on the intensity of my workout that morning, I'll have anything from a small bowl of muesli and homemade coconut yogurt to a giant protein waffle that's loaded with nut butter and stewed fruit. Most times, though, I opt for something on the smaller side because I can't stand being bogged down by a big breakfast. Chia pudding is a favorite because it's quick, easy, and packs a lotta punch. This one is made with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and pure maple syrup, and I throw in some maca, lucuma, and beet powder for good measure. I top it off with coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of whatever it is I have hanging around the pantry—in this case, @sevensundaysmn muesli, flaked coconut, and fresh fruit. — @ohladycakes #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2830.jpg;(Oh, Ladycakes takeover, 1/5) Hi, guys! Ashlae from @ohladycakes here. I'm thrilled to be taking over Angela's Instagram account and to let you in on a day of my plant-based eats. Although it's not all that glamorous, my first (post-workout) breakfast is almost always a @vega_team protein shake and toast. Most of the time the toast is dry (because I've got an affinity for plain toast) but, every once in awhile, I'll slather on some peanut butter, arrange some banana slices on top, then give each piece a good shake of cinnamon. If I'm feeling extra fancy, I'll drizzle on even more peanut butter then finish the slices with some kasha, flaked coconut, and hemp seeds. #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2831.jpg;Happy Tuesday, everyone! Are things moving at mach speed for you like they are for me this month? Luckily, Ashlae from @ohladycakes is here today giving us all an excuse to slow down: Please take a load off and follow along with the very last #osgtakeover of 2016! I’ve had some requests to showcase my own day of eats OSG-style, and I will definitely take you up on that in 2017. I can’t promise my meals will be styled to the nines (that just doesn't happen these days 😂), but I can promise they’ll be a real example of my eats as a mama of two. Anyway, more on all of this in the new year! 🎉  Ashlae’s based in Denver, CO, and has been blogging since October 2011. Though she’s currently a full-time blogger, she’ll soon revert to part-time blogging as she’s gearing up to launch her own business. The recipe collection on Oh, Ladycakes began with vegan versions of Ashlae’s fave decadent dessert recipes, but has recently evolved to be more inclusive of dishes she consumes on a day-to-day basis. In fact, the most popular recipe on her blog is actually a savory recipe, Spicy Peanut Stew with Butternut Squash + Chickpeas...which you’ll see featured here in a few hours! Let’s dig in, shall we? 🍽
user_28;user_2832.jpg;We just heard from the Canadian App Store that The Oh She Glows Recipe App is one of the Best of 2016 on the iPad! This is such a crazy honour, and it’s all because of your amazing support. I couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve created and how much it has grown since we launched earlier this year. In 2015, our goal was to make my plant-based recipes more accessible to you on your phones and tablets in a visually appealing way, and it’s so fun to see that dream come to life and that so many of you love it is just icing on the cake. 🎂 We truly appreciate all of your feedback as it helps us grow and improve what we offer you. We’re really excited for what’s to come! Don’t forget: Our app is currently 50% off (link in profile) for a limited time and there’s a free holiday cookie bundle included on the bundles page as a small token of our appreciation. 🍪 Our app makes a fun stocking stuffer for the foodie in your life, too. Just sayin' 😉  If you're in Canada you can try out a smaller demo version of our app at various Apple stores across Canada! How fun is that? (I just posted a sneak peek on my Insta Stories if you want to check it out!) I’m not sure if the demo version is live in the US or outside of North America, but maybe you can let us know if you see it?  We’re still working away on the Android version, which will be coming in early January. We were hoping to have it ready for the holidays, but we’d like to beta test the app once again before launching to make sure everything is perfect. Not too long to go now!! I’m also releasing a detox-inspired recipe bundle in the new year, too, so keep your eyes all like... 👀 for that.  Last but not least, high fives to Eric and our amazing app team for working so hard on this app over the past year! 👊👊👊 I think I can speak for us all that we’re super excited to see what 2017 brings. Thank YOU and happy cooking, from all of us. ❤️
user_28;user_2833.jpg;(Faring Well takeover, 5/5) Dessert is a cup of peppermint tea—or maybe a mug of cocoa. But when recipe testing for the holidays is in full swing, I’m lucky enough on a few days to have something sweet leftover to nibble on later. This is a sweet potato pie I’ve fallen head over heels for—and the multiple recipe tests are not bumming me out one bit. This was such a treat to hang with you today, thank you Angela for having me! — @_faringwell #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2834.jpg;(Faring Well takeover, 4/5) Dinner is almost always a macro bowl. I replace grains with more veggies because I’ve eaten so many veggies in my life I have actually turned into one. Here we have some steamed broccoli, cauliflower, delicata squash (a fall “must”), cooked beet, baked tofu, caraway kraut, and a drizzle of tahini sauce. It’s my “showstopper” meal of the day, which I look forward to the most. All the good feels. — @_faringwell #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2835.jpg;(Faring Well takeover, 3/5) Lunch is more of a snack-sesh over here, typically comprised of a mixture of steamed veggies with either tahini for dipping or a simple homemade hummus. I tend to be here and there in the afternoons, and with all the recipe testing I have little interest in creating more dirty dishes to tackle. After my protein-packed breakfast and snack, a little savory veggie-action and healthy fat perfectly tides me over until dinner, and keeps the dishes to a minimum (priorities). — @_faringwell #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2836.jpg;(Faring Well takeover, 2/5) Moving along to the midmorning snack! I can’t help but whip up this green smoothie after my morning exercise. It’s hydrating and filled with more plant protein to help my baby muscles recover and fuel me for a morning of work. This gem is comprised of frozen bananas, blueberries, vanilla plant protein, frozen spinach, and cashew milk. — @_faringwell #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2837.jpg;"(Faring Well takeover, 1/5) Good morning, folks! I’m super pumped to hang with you guys today and share some of my daily plant-based eats around these parts. This bowl of chocolatey overnight oats is packed with my favorite vanilla plant protein, raw cacao, cinnamon, and sprouted oats. It's a no-brainer every morning when I first wake up (starving, as always). I enjoy a bowl/jar of these before hitting my AM workout, and sincerely enjoy the dose of chocolate first thing in the morning ;). — @_faringwell #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2838.jpg;Now that I've had my 🍵 and overnight oats, I'm excited to let you know that Jessie of @_faringwell is taking over my Instagram today! Get ready to see how she fuels her days.

user_28;user_2839.jpg;My matcha is glowing thanks to the Mayfair filter ☺️ Lately I've been all about matcha since coffee tends to make my baby all like 😳 so green tea is a nice compromise. Keeps me alert and feeling almost like a fully functioning human. 😂 I like to add a small amount of sweetened almond milk when I'm feeling crazy (which is often) 😈

user_28;user_2841.jpg;Welcome to your holiday vegan cookie headquarters! Today on the blog, I'm sharing my 15 best #vegan cookies (and 5 more square type treats). There's a direct link in my profile to visit the post! The cookies in the image above are my One Bowl Jumbo Chocolate Chunk cookies (v+gf). 🤗 Enjoy, my friends, and happy December! 🌲✨💃🍪🍾
user_28;user_2842.jpg;"(Pure Ella takeover, 5/5) I’m super excited to share my favourite dinner with you. I just love great veggie burgers, and lately, I’m back to enjoying these Lentil Burgers with a Tamari Ketchup (recipes from my Cut the Sugar book)—they are so good, plus they contain a good portion of protein to keep me full, yet are nice and light. When I eat veggie burgers I hardly ever eat them with a bun, instead I prefer them with a salad and a side of quinoa or buckwheat. That way I maximize on nutrition and avoid empty carbs that fill you up. Once you finish your dinner, don’t forget to turn up your favourite tunes and DANCE! It’s the best habit to get into, to just have fun and dance in the living room or kitchen! :) Seriously, not only are you having fun and feeling happy—but you’re also lowering your blood sugar and keeping your heart healthy and happy! A walk outside after dinner is also a great way to end the day. Last thing I want to add is that in between these meals and snacks I try to drink a glass of water or herbal tea. I hardly ever drink juice unless it’s freshly juiced. :) AND yes, I do love to bake delicious treats and desserts, but those are not an everyday treat; they’re usually something I bake for my blog or for the weekend, and I try to maximize on nutrition with desserts, too, and always try to choose healthier ingredients and sweeteners. So, my sweet friends, I hope you’ve all been having fun in joining me on OSG’s Instagram takeover, and I hope you’ve learned a thing or two about how you can cut sugar without feeling deprived and while still enjoying a bit of a sweet life by adopting healthy sugar habits. With love, Ella <3 — @pure_ella #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2843.jpg;(Pure Ella takeover, 4/5) Between 3–4pm is usually the time people struggle hardest with cravings! Especially if you’re working and the day just doesn’t seem to end…and sometimes your cravings can really be triggered by emotional stress or even boredom…. (Seriously, I’ve been there!) That’s why it’s important to have some kind of healthy snack within reach so that when you need a little pick-me-up you’re not tempted by those nasty vending machine snacks. If I have some nice home-baked snacks (like, lately, my Superfood Healthy Pumpkin Bars) I have one of those, or just a handful of almonds, or make my own trail mix that’s super easy and simple to customize and—most importantly—healthy! Here I’m having a mix of almonds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, coconut chips, and—for an added little sweetness—dried cranberries. All the magnesium, protein, and healthy fats in the nuts and seeds satisfies not just your sugar cravings, but also gives you a boost of essential minerals your body and brain need to function well. It’s really the simplest way to snack in a healthy and happy way! I also make a nice Rooibos or Chai tea this time of year to give me that coffee indulgence, and the spices keep me warm and happy because they also have a natural sweet taste, especially cinnamon. :) If you’re quite full from lunch, though, reach for a green apple or some other fruit that’s low-sugar but tart and tasty—green apples rock! I keep an apple or a trail mix in my purse when I’m on the road to have a healthy snack with me all the time. :) xo Ella — @pure_ella #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2844.jpg;"(Pure Ella takeover, 3/5) When it comes to lunchtime, I usually incorporate some type of grains (or leftover gluten-free pasta, in this case), with lots of veggies that are usually seasonal and vibrant and make my plate come alive! Here I have a bed of baby spinach topped with purple kale, red cabbage, beets, cucumber, and avocado. (Obviously, I am really vibing on purple right now! ;)) I also include a healthy protein; in this case it’s edamame beans. I top this with a drizzle of organic EVOO and a squeeze of lemon juice, freshly ground pepper and Himalayan pink salt, and some fresh herbs if I have those on hand. What I try to do is have 3/4 plate filled with veggies and about 1/4 plate with carbs. Incorporating healthy fats and protein is also very important and crucial in helping absorb nutrients from the vegetables and making you feel fuller. (If I do have a little sweet craving after lunch, I have a couple of 72% or 80% dark chocolates—because I’m a chocoholic and also sometimes you just need a boost of superfoods .;)) Aside from a hearty, filling-yet-still-light lunch, it’s important to squeeze in some type of physical movement—I usually go for a walk with my dog after lunch or for a run about 1 hour after lunch. Incorporating physical activity is crucial for keeping your body and blood sugar stable and healthy, as exercise actually lowers blood sugar. Come back to check out my mid-afternoon snack! xo Ella — @pure_ella #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2845.jpg;(Pure Ella takeover, 2/5) It’s time for my mid-morning snack, and this is when I reach for either fresh fruit or a combination of dairy-free yogurt with fruit and some delicious toppings. Here I’m enjoying plain unsweetened coconut yogurt with pomegranate arils, hemp seeds, and raw cacao nibs. This is a delicious low-sugar snack that will pick up my energy and keep it stable up until lunch. On days I go to the gym in the morning, I also throw in a green protein smoothie to help with muscle recovery and keep my protein intake higher. A green juice would be great, too! A healthy mid-morning snack (even just a fruit serving) is important so that you don’t go too hungry before lunch, which would mean your blood sugar drops and you could end up eating too much. Also, do add in a walk or some kind of physical activity every few hours. Park the car farther away from the office, take the stairs—this also affects your blood sugar (I’ll be explaining that in the next post.) See you at lunch, my sweets! :) xo Ella — @pure_ella #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2846.jpg;"(Pure Ella takeover, 1/5) Hi everyone, it’s Ella from @pure_ella. I’m so excited to be taking over OSG’s Instagram! Since my cookbook has set me apart as a sugar expert, I thought I'd show you how I cut sugar throughout my day. I used to be a sugar junkie and relied on it to keep my energy up—boy, did I have it all wrong. Turns out it’s the sugar spikes and crashes that deprive you of energy, not to mention mess with your focus, mental clarity, and overall health. Now, my approach is all about adopting healthy sugar habits that nourish your body and keep your blood sugar in balance. When I talk about the sugar that I consume and is healthier, I’m referring to unrefined sugar, preferably low-glycemic, and sugar found naturally in fruit and grains. All carbs are essentially sugar because they convert to glucose in your body, so also watch how you combine your total carb intake during a meal (e.g. if you’re having a big bowl of pasta, hold off on that granola bar and eat it as a snack 2 hrs later). When I wake up I drink water first thing, then about an hour later I have breakfast. This is my typical breakfast during the weekdays (eaten around 8am)—a bowl of satisfying oatmeal. I cook the oats with water and top with unsweetened almond milk (or another plant milk I have on hand), and I top this with brain food (a.k.a. hemp seeds and walnuts + other nuts and seeds I might have around). I drizzle this just a bit with either honey or coconut nectar. Rarely, I add fresh fruit (I prefer that later as a snack), and rarely, I add dried fruit—here I’m going all out because that dried fig looked great and made my oatmeal much prettier and IG worthy. :) It’s also worth it to mention that those nuts and seeds add a great amount of protein and healthy fats—key nutrients that you require at every meal. A savoury breakfast is a good option, too—I love a scrambled tofu or avocado toast on low-glycemic grain bread, like my home-baked sourdough rye, with a protein shake. (On weekends we may have pancakes or waffles as a “treat”.) After this, I send the kids off and make myself a nice cup of green tea—unsweetened, of course. ;) Stay tuned for more inspo! xo Ella #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2847.jpg;Good morning, friends! Who’s ready for another delicious #osgtakeover? 😋 Today I’m introducing you to the lovely Ella, blogger and photographer behind @pure_ella and author of cookbook Cut the Sugar. Ella began blogging as a creative outlet for her depression, which stemmed from dealing with a rare and difficult muscle disease. From being unable to walk under her own power or even hold her baby, she’s come a long way in her healing journey. Ella is now a vibrantly healthy mom of two, and she attributes her success to the plant-based diet she adopted as she relearned how to eat and take care of herself. Her approach to sugar and food in general is to eat with balance and reach for foods that are not only good, but also good for you. I hope you’ll follow along as Ella walks us through her inspiring day of plant-based eats. Take it away, Ella! 👏✨

user_28;user_2849.jpg;Today on the blog I’m sharing my thoughts on life as a family of four (how has it been almost 2 months?!), and this Cozy Butternut, Sweet Potato, and Red Lentil Stew recipe created in partnership with @PulseCanada. Yep, it’s time to get COZY up in here! I think you’re going to love it. (Direct link in profile.) #LovePulses #sponsored #plantpower #user_28
user_28;user_2850.jpg;(Mississippi Vegan takeover, 5/5) I don't have a sweet tooth y'all! Truly. I'd rather have potato chips for dessert. *But* I had to show off a little bit for you guys, right? So here you go: my version of Cracker Jacks, but better. Popcorn, maple caramel, sliced almonds, chopped pistachios, coconut sugar, and maldon salt. And I must say that they are outrageous! Because they are salty and not too sweet, I'm a happy man. I do plan on getting most of these recipes up on my blog (mississippivegan.com), so do go check it out as I have some other fun recipes on there currently. I can't thank @user_28 enough for letting me take over her feed today. You're such a sweetheart! And I hope all of you have enjoyed my takeover. Ok, that's all! Bye! — @mississippivegan #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2851.jpg;(Mississippi Vegan takeover, 4/5) Supper time! Here is one of my many versions of a macro bowl, Mississippi Vegan style as I only use the prettiest veggies. I recently moved from NYC to Jackson, MS, and I knew the first thing I would have to do after relocating here was to find the local farmers’ market. (I would go to the one in Union Square [Manhattan] two to three times a week!) I was tickled to find loads of beautiful plants at the one here in Jackson. For example these purple and watermelon radishes. I kept the tops on and sautéed them in a cast iron with olive oil, garlic, and sea salt. And how about these purple and white sweet potatoes. They were just roasted in the oven until soft. Do you see that deep purple color? I can't! Next up are sautéed brussels sprouts. All of these veggies are loaded on top of turmeric-cayenne infused rice. To finish, a drizzle on top of tahini, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt. I also snagged a few viola petals from my front porch because, why not? — @mississippivegan #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2852.jpg;(Mississippi Vegan takeover, 3/5) I'm all about doctoring up leftovers, like this cashew cream of potato soup. This soup works beautifully as a blank canvas. It's just cashews, boiled potatoes, sautéed garlic, sea salt, and white pepper—then blended until smooth. The other night I served it with roasted Mississippi shiitake mushrooms, roasted pearled red onions, smoked olive oil, and fresh rosemary and thyme (hop on over to @mississippivegan to take a look). But today for an afternoon snack, I loaded it with fresh spinach, loads of tarragon (I love it so much!), and a sprinkling of smoked paprika. To finish, a healthy cracking of black pepper and drizzle of good olive oil. You know you want it! — @mississippivegan #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2853.jpg;(Mississippi Vegan takeover, 2/5) Next up is my midday salad. I find that if I eat heavier cooked foods during the day, I get tired and sluggish. Who has time for that!? So usually, I like a large and juicy salad loaded with vegetables and served with a light and refreshing dressing. This salad here has romaine hearts, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, local blue basil, and tons of black pepper. To finish, a hefty drizzling of my Meyer lemon, pecan, chickpea-miso dressing. The Meyer lemons are from Louisiana and the pecans are from my backyard! Can't get more local than that, eh? Lucky for me, it is still pretty warm here in the south, so this salad is perfect for eating in the sun while getting some much needed vitamin D. — @mississippivegan #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2854.jpg;(Mississippi Vegan takeover, 1/5) Hey Y'all! My name is Timothy, a.k.a. @mississippivegan. I am so excited to take over @user_28 Instagram for the day. What a treat! I will share with you what a typical day of eating looks like for me as a vegan. I strive to always source local produce and also support local farmers. Therefore, breakfast is usually a mono-meal of seasonal fruit, like these delicious satsumas. These are Louisiana satsumas and I just can't get enough. They are incredibly easy to peel and they taste like Skittles! A little tip from me to you, go for the smaller ones when shopping (or picking), they are sweeter! #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2855.jpg;Happy Friday! Today Timothy of @mississippivegan is here helping us celebrate the arrival of the weekend with some gorgeous food photography, as he showcases his typical day of plant-based eats in the next instalment of the #osgtakeover series. A self-professed “baby blogger,” Timothy has only been blogging since this summer—but he’s been actively creating content for his Instagram page Mississippi Vegan for over 2 years. (If you haven’t checked out his feed, you really should! *heart eyes*) He’s also done many pop-up dinners at different event spaces and restaurants in NYC...how cool is that? Recently, Timothy moved back home to Mississippi to slow down, develop recipes for his new blog, and work on his first cookbook, which will come out in fall 2018. The book will feature recipes inspired by the southern, Cajun, and creole cuisines and flavours that are near and dear to his heart. As you'll see in his takeover, his food is flavorful, creative, and comforting. 🙌  So are you ready to get this pre-weekend party started? Let’s give the Mississippi Vegan a warm welcome from the OSG community as he kicks off his takeover! I’m so excited to have him here, and I hope you are too. 👌🤗 (Photo credit: @fogwoodandfig)
user_28;user_2856.jpg;(The First Mess takeover, 5/5) I generally find a way to eat chocolate almost every day because treating yourself is key! These are the brownies from my upcoming vegan cookbook. I made them for a special project the other day, and having a pan just sitting in the refrigerator has been pretty great. They’re gluten/grain-free, oil-free, and so fudgy that it’s almost ridiculous. It’s been great sharing my day of plant-based meals with you all! Thanks so much for following along ☺ — @thefirstmess #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2857.jpg;(The First Mess takeover, 4/5) This is basically my fantasy dinner bowl—with all of my favourite foods doused in a homemade cider vinaigrette and some hot sauce for good measure. Brown basmati rice, roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, chickpeas, and arugula. I prep the rice and sweet potatoes ahead of time, warm them up when I need them, and then just throw everything into the bowl with a sprinkle of sunflower seeds. I never get tired of this combination, and I love how great it makes me feel. True comfort food. — @thefirstmess #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2858.jpg;(The First Mess takeover, 3/5) I do at least one warming potion/superfood latte a day, usually around that time of the afternoon when I need something to keep me focused. This one is a mugful of almond milk, 1 teaspoon virgin coconut oil, ½ teaspoon of turmeric, ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon maca powder, a drop of vanilla, the tiniest pinch of cayenne, and a little maple syrup. This cozy drink usually saves me from scarfing an entire bar of chocolate in 5 minutes ☺ — @thefirstmess #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2859.jpg;(The First Mess takeover, 2/5) I rarely do a full-stop lunch! I tend to be a grazer, and working on recipe development/food photography most of the time adds to that habit. If I’m actually sitting down to lunch, though, it’s usually something piled up on top of sourdough or sprouted whole-grain toast. Here, I’ve sautéed some mushrooms with rosemary and shallots, and then finished them with a bit of vegetable stock, miso, and balsamic vinegar. Lunch is also my guaranteed solo meal of the day, and since my partner can’t stand mushrooms, it’s my only opportunity to get them in ☺ — @thefirstmess #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2860.jpg;"(The First Mess takeover, 1/5) Good morning! So happy to be on Angela’s account, and so excited to share a dream day of plant-based meals from my perspective. I’m generally up quite early because I like to get my exercise in before the day gets away. In all honesty, the thought of a smoothie/smoothie bowl gets me through the majority of the workout. This one here is an açaí bowl with bananas, frozen strawberries, and blueberries. The homemade hemp granola and heaps of coconut on top is the best part though. Worthy of note: the bowl and the workout happen AFTER coffee ;) — @thefirstmess #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2861.jpg;"Good morning, everyone 👋 It’s time for another mouthwatering #osgtakeover where I give the reins to a fellow food blogger to showcase a typical or “dream” day of plant-based eats. This week I’m welcoming Laura from @thefirstmess to my Instagram page. She’s a fellow Canadian from Southern Ontario (*fist pump*), and her specialty is wholesome, seasonally inspired main courses that come together with minimal fuss. (Pro Tip: If the cooler weather’s got you down, be sure to head over to her blog to check out her Creamy French Lentils with Mushrooms & Kale stew; this cozy dish is a tried and tested fan favourite that’s so cozy for fall/winter.) Her food photography also gives me all the heart eye emojis. 😍 Laura will be celebrating the release of her debut cookbook, The First Mess Cookbook, in early March 2017. (I was given a sneak peek and can attest that it’s an absolute stunner!) Let the countdown to March begin. High fives, Laura!  Prepare your eyes to feast on some beautiful, scrumptious-looking food photography as Laura shares her ideal day of plant-based meals, in 3...2...1...🤗"
user_28;user_2862.jpg;If you’ve seen my Snapchat or Insta Stories lately, you’ve probably noticed that my Vegan Banana Bread (direct link in profile) is a regular in my life these days. It’s become nothing short of an obsession, making the perfect addition to the breakfast table...or lunch table, or snack table, or any-meal table (muhahaha). It’s also the reason I hoard spotty bananas in a special corner of the kitchen. 😉 Eric once tried throwing out my old bananas...and, boy, that didn’t go over so well. 🙅 ~~ Today I’m dedicating this new fave recipe of mine to one of my fave people, Ashley McLaughlin (aka: @edibleash), in honour of her virtual baby shower! Ash and I have been friends since waaaay back in our early blog days (like, 2008 or 2009!). We were brought together by a mutual love of homemade granola bars (we both had granola bar businesses back in the day), blogging, photography, and eating for a living. Last year, Ashley shot the food photography for my second cookbook, #osgeveryday, and it's been amazing watching her turn her love for food photography into a successful career. Now I’m sharing in her excitement as she and her hubby await the arrival of their first baby in a couple months, and I couldn’t be happier for them. Thank you to Sonja (@acouplecooks) and Gena (@thefullhelping) for organizing this virtual baby shower (#ediblebabybash). The theme is breakfast, so if that’s your jam be sure to follow along for all kinds of delish breakfast recipes. And if you want to try out my fave vegan banana bread, be sure to click the link in my profile to be taken to the recipe! You can also find the recipe in the Oh She Glows Recipe App.💥
user_28;user_2863.jpg;(Cookie + Kate takeover, 5/5) Here’s my favorite crunchy, salty snack—popcorn! I grew up eating stovetop popcorn, and it’s 1000 times better than the microwave version. I love that I can keep my kitchen stocked with popcorn kernels and cook up some fresh popcorn whenever I get the craving. (Bonus—since I have to actually cook the popcorn, I don’t find myself mindlessly snacking on it like I would with a bag of chips.) I love topping my popcorn with a drizzle of good olive oil, sea salt, and black pepper (it goes great with a glass of wine after a long day). My friend @gimmesomeoven got me hooked on nutritional yeast on popcorn, so I often add some for cheese-like flavor. So good! This wraps up my day of plant-based meals. I hope you found some cooking inspiration in my photos today, and thanks again to Angela for having me! xo, @cookieandkate #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2864.jpg;(Cookie + Kate takeover, 4/5) Would you look at that beauty? I just made my Thai red curry recipe (available on my blog) so I could redo the photos. They weren’t doing the recipe justice!  This dish is rich, creamy, and full of veggies and kale. It’s perfect for cool fall/winter evenings, and more redeeming than takeout. The secret to making awesome Thai curries at home is to add a little bit of coconut sugar, rice vinegar, and tamari, which makes the dish taste much more complex than just curry paste with coconut milk. I’m pretty excited to have leftover curry for the next few days (can you tell that I live on leftovers?). — @cookieandkate #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2865.jpg;"(Cookie + Kate takeover, 3/5) Some days I need a snack to tide me over to the next meal, and hummus is one of my favorites. It’s super tasty and offers some protein, since it’s made with chickpeas and tahini. I happened to have some leftover homemade hummus today (it’s the Green Goddess Hummus on my blog) but I love Trader Joe’s roasted garlic hummus, too. Today, I dipped some bell pepper and pretzels in my hummus; I also love it with warm whole-grain pita bread/pita chips. — @cookieandkate #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2866.jpg;"(Cookie + Kate takeover, 2/5) For lunch, I made a big kale salad with the surplus of kale in my veggie drawer. I added cooked quinoa and chopped up some other random veggies in my drawer—cabbage, radishes, cucumber. Then I whipped up some creamy, herbed tahini dressing, making enough to last me through the week (for a similar salad, check out my anything-goes kale salad on cookieandkate.com). Kale salads can be a little more time-consuming to make, but I love them because they’re delicious (of course) and hearty enough to keep well as leftovers. Maybe you know this already, but the trick to making an amazing kale salad is to remove the tough ribs, chop the kale into small, bite-size pieces, and then massage it by scrunching the leaves up over and over until they’re fragrant and softer. If you’ve ever ordered a kale salad that arrives full of giant, poke-y kale leaves, you know how important this is! It’s such an awkward meal to eat that I’ve sworn off ordering kale salads on first dates. ;) — @cookieandkate #osgtakeover"
user_28;user_2867.jpg;(Cookie + Kate takeover, 1/5) Hi, everyone! This is Kate from @cookieandkate, and I’m so excited to be taking over my friend Angela’s Oh She Glows Instagram today (what?!). She asked me to share a day’s worth of plant-based meals with you guys. I must confess that I don’t always eat so well. Sometimes even food bloggers are too busy to cook! Here’s what an ideal day looks like for me.  When I wake up, the first thing I do is chug a big glass of water or two because I’m always parched in the morning! Then, I feed my dog, Cookie, and start some coffee. That’s Cookie in the corner—she is not to be trusted around food. :) I have to eat breakfast (or my blood sugar will crash later in the day) but I’m not a morning person, so I keep breakfasts simple.  Today, it’s reheated apple steel-cut oatmeal with a spoonful of almond butter, which I shared recently on my blog, cookieandkate.com. It’s a one-pot breakfast that you can cook on Sunday and portion off for weekday mornings. The trick to making amazing steel-cut oats is to toast the oats before you add liquid.  My quick, go-to breakfasts are whole-grain toast with peanut butter or mashed avocado, and granola or muesli with almond milk and fruit. If all else fails, I’ll grab a big handful of nuts and some dried fruit to keep me going. #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2868.jpg;Happy Halloween, everyone! 🎃 I’m super excited to kick off this week with another drool-worthy #osgtakeover. (Be sure to check out last week’s series debut takeover by @blissfulbasil if you haven’t already!) This morning I’d love to introduce you to the lovely Kate from @cookieandkate. If you’re not already familiar with her vibrant, creative, and approachable recipes, hopefully today will inspire you to head over to her blog + Insta account and check them out! Though Cookie + Kate began simply as a creative outlet, Kate’s now a full-time food blogger who’s set to release her first cookbook, Love Real Food, next May. She’s got a passion for sharing meatless mains that make even the most devoted of meat lovers ask for seconds. Her food photographs, much like her recipes and writing, are stunning (seriously: stunning!) yet approachable and down-to-earth. And really, who can resist her super cute pooch, Cookie, who makes food-stalking cameos on her blog, Snapchat, and Instagram Stories?! I die. 😂 🐶  So without further ado, please make sure your seatbacks are in a comfy position, make sure your personal electronics are fully charged, and try not to drool as you follow along with Kate’s #osgtakeover. 😉 Take it away, Kate!
user_28;user_2869.jpg;(Blissful Basil takeover, 5/5) Dinner is my favorite meal of the day, and I love making something that’s just as satisfying as it is nourishing. Lately, that’s been seasonal power bowls and warming soups, but tonight I was craving a big salad with lots of crisp greens and crunchy seeds. This chopped napa cabbage salad with sweet tamari-sesame dressing is everything: sweet, tangy, refreshing, super crisp, and satisfyingly crunchy. The recipe is on my blog (www.blissfulbasil.com), but I made a few small adjustments. I added one bunch of chopped lacinato kale to up the nutritional oomph and more tamari, maple syrup, and sesame seeds (to account for the extra greens as well as the most gigantic head of napa cabbage I’ve ever encountered). Thanks for letting me spend the day with you! I hope this peek into my ideal day of plant-based eating was as enjoyable for you to see as it was for me to share. Gratitude and good vibes to @user_28 for letting me occupy this lovely space for a day! xo, @blissfulbasil #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2870.jpg;(Blissful Basil takeover, 4/5) Today’s afternoon snack: a green smoothie so vibrant it glows...almost. I spent this afternoon chipping away on photo edits, replied to blog comments, and did a quick “brain dump” of new recipe ideas. Then, I finished out the workday with a second email sweep. Since I didn’t have a chance to squeeze in a workout this morning, I stopped working around 5pm and fit in a 30-minute workout. Exercise is something I look forward to, because it keeps my mind energized, optimistic, and free from worry. I work out 4–6 times a week, and although strong, toned muscles are an added perk, it’s the feel-good vibes and mood boost that keep me coming back. Of course, post-workout smoothies like this one certainly don’t hurt either!  To make this smoothie: Add 2 small frozen bananas, 1–1 1/2 cups filtered water, 1/2 small green apple (cored and seeded), 2 handfuls baby spinach, 1–2 tablespoons pumpkin seed protein powder (or other plant-based protein), and 1 small knob of fresh ginger (peeled and roughly chopped) into a high-speed blender. Blend until smooth, pour into a glass, and top with a small handful of pomegranate seeds and coconut flakes. — @blissfulbasil #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2871.jpg;(Blissful Basil takeover, 3/5) For lunch, I typically stick with foods that are fresh, energizing, and easy to digest, because I’m prone to post-lunch sleepiness if I eat anything too heavy. I almost always have leftovers from dinner or recipe testing, but today was a special exception! I took time to prepare one of my favorites: avocado toast. This particular variation is toasted sunflower bread topped with sliced avocado, burst garlic-herb tomatoes, and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. The recipe is featured in the “Brunch” section of my cookbook, but it also makes a wonderful light lunch.  For years, I had a habit of chipping away at work while eating lunch, but lately I’ve been prioritizing “balance” over “busy” and that means taking an actual break from work to enjoy lunch. Usually, I’ll take a break to watch inspiring YouTube videos or read an article on a topic I’m curious about (e.g., the cosmos and the brain benefits of meditation are two recent topics of interest)! — @blissfulbasil #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2872.jpg;(Blissful Basil takeover, 2/5) Morning snack time! I’m a snack lover and often look forward to snacks just as much as meals. Today I had two “power biscotti” and a matcha latte. I was in need of an extra energy boost this morning, and this matcha latte did the trick. To make it: add 1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder to a bowl, pour equal parts (I use 3 ounces of each) hot water and coconut milk over top, and vigorously whisk until frothy. The Power Biscotti are featured in my upcoming cookbook—out December 20th—and they are one of my all-time favorite snacks. They’re vegan, allergy-friendly (i.e. gluten-free, nut-free, soy-free, grain-free, oil-free), and offer a subtle sweetness along with the most satisfying crunch. Plus, they’re great for dunking! #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2873.jpg;(Blissful Basil takeover, 1/5) Good morning! This is Ashley from @blissfulbasil , and I’m honored (and super excited) to be taking over Oh She Glows’ Instagram today. In the spirit of sharing, I thought it would be fun to share a few of my daily routines and offer a peek at what my ideal day of plant-powered eating looks like. I want to highlight the word “ideal” here, because I certainly don’t nosh on such a snap-worthy spread every day. That said, this is a great example of the way I most love to eat. Alright, let’s get to it!  I never used to consider myself a “morning person,” but I’ve definitely become one! I’m more motivated, balanced, and optimistic with an early and self-reflective start, so I typically wake up between 5:30am and 6:30am but will happily sleep in if my body needs it. Once I’m up, I get ready for the day and then plop down in a quiet spot in our living room to meditate for 20 minutes. It’s taken me years to develop a consistent meditation practice, but I’ve found that just 20 minutes sets the stage for a more mindful and peaceful approach to the entire day.  Once I’m done meditating, I head straight to the kitchen and make myself breakfast and a cup of tea or coffee. I’m a smoothie lover, so that’s often my go-to breakfast, but lately I’ve been enjoying coconut yogurt topped with granola and a drizzle of maple syrup or vegan honey (yes, there is such a thing as vegan honey—it’s made from apples)! I often eat breakfast while completing my morning email check (I try to check email just twice a day—once in the morning and once in the late afternoon—so that I’m not reacting to my inbox all day). Once I’ve checked email, I plan out specific projects, tasks, and to-dos for the day. I have a general, recurring schedule that I follow each week, which makes planning daily to-dos much easier than if I were to approach each day with a completely blank slate. #osgtakeover
user_28;user_2874.jpg;"Hey friends! I'm excited to let you know about a new takeover series that I'm hosting on my Instagram page. Starting today and continuing over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing takeovers from some of my fave food bloggers. Each blogger will walk you through their typical or ""ideal"" day of plant-based meals from breakfast to dessert. I hope you’ll be inspired to try out some new plant-based dishes, ingredients, or recipes along the way! We’d love to hear your feedback if you have any ideas for future takeovers, too. To kick off the series, I'd like to introduce you to Ashley @blissfulbasil, a school psychologist and the author, photographer, and recipe creator behind Blissful Basil—though for many of you she likely needs no introduction. She’s been blogging for a little over 6 years now, and will be releasing her debut cookbook, Blissful Basil, on December 20th, 2016. I can’t wait! Ashley’s creative recipes, which range from comforting meals to naturally decadent desserts, reflect her passion for transforming whole, plant-based ingredients into dishes that are both nourishing and satisfying. On her blog you’ll find recipes like: Cosmic Strawberry-Ginger-Peach Bliss Bowl, Spring Risotto with Asparagus, Peas, + Roasted Garlic Cashew Cream, and Quinoa-Cauliflower Cakes with Herbed Brazil Nut Cream. Yes, please! 🤗👌 I hope you’ll follow along with our first #osgtakeover as I turn the reins over to Ashley in 3...2...1… :) (Photo credit:@vsprungphoto)"

user_28;user_2883.jpg;Don't you love when lunches are super tasty and super quick?! Today's bowl was reheated stir fry from last night (featuring green beans, snap peas, spiralized beet, chickpeas) with rainbow quinoa. I topped it with toasted pepitas, hemp hearts, pink salt, pepper, and a homemade vinaigrette. Perfecto!! I'd say it's baby-in-the-belly approved based on all this kicking. 😳 Despite my jam-packed stomach, I'm off to find the coconut oil chocolate stash in my freezer...muhauha. (For my coconut oil chocolate recipe, see the direct link in my profile...it's FAQ #1!) 😈
user_28;user_2884.jpg;Really enjoying this lunch lately! It's an easy way to use up grain + veggie leftovers.

user_28;user_28140.jpg;A huge thank you to @kellysbake shoppe for creating this beautiful birthday cake for Adriana's party! It went perfectly with our Frozen theme. (ps - and it put the smash cake I made her to shame! 😜☺️) such a happy day ❤️

user_28;user_28142.jpg;Just made @meganjgordon Spiced Butternut Squash and Sorghum Salad (recipe via @thekitchn) - I won't lie it was a lot of prep work (chopping butternut is my nemesis...ha), but it's really tasty. A nice way to kick off September. I made a few tweaks - cut the sorghum in half (I wanted more squash to grain), used a 3 pound butternut squash, swapped maple syrup for honey and reduced it a bit, cut salt down to 1 tsp, and added a bit of ground allspice along with the other spices. I also soaked the sorghum overnight to cut down on cooking time (40ish mins vs. 50-60 mins). note to self - if you find yourself wondering if 3/4 cup of toasted pepita seeds is too much for a salad you smarten yourself the hell up. Granted, I probably ate half of the seeds before they made it to the salad...anywho... Thanks Megan!!
