user_5;user_52.jpg;the only thing i no longer wear from this photo is the long hair. keep your clothes, wear and rewear them over and over. i have no idea how old this belt is, it use to be from my mom. if you treat your clothes well and cherish them, they can last years and years. clothes aren’t disposables, they’re items we should keep and for this we need to think twice before getting something new. 💭 some better alternatives to tossing clothing in the bin: swapping, selling, donating (to people you know or charity shops. textile bins don’t count), upcycling & repairing. . #ethicalfashion #sustainablefashion #ethicallymade #veganshoes #vintage #slowfashion
user_5;user_53.jpg;been working my way through the book Fashionopolis by @danathomasparis this week and still have a lot to go. It’s full of great insights and information.

user_5;user_54.jpg;i started reading the book Fashionopolis by @danathomasparis and it is brilliant so far. although it does not focus on racism in the fashion industry, it is very eye opening in this matter and i am looking forward to learn and research more. this will be the topic of next week’s video and podcast where Christèle from @maisonmbosso will be invited. I quickly touch on this project in the introduction of my newest video. All ads revenue will be donated and I also added lots of resources in my “blm” story highlights and in the description of the video. . 📷 @taniabiland . #ethicalfashion #fashionopolis

user_5;user_59.jpg;a great week in the mountains with these power women, sisters, and dear friends 🤍. strong friendships and deep connection is something i’ve always longed for and although I met lots of amazing people while traveling and living abroad, there is no one who’ll know me better than the girls I’ve grown up and went to school with. Also super grateful we’ve all evolved in ways that made us connect even more over the years and adopted common interests which made us closer.

user_5;user_510.jpg;I wanted the swans in the photo as well until they came a little too close.. i have been doing at home workouts and yoga a lot more than usual over the last month and although i did really enjoy it, i missed being outdoor as much as i’m used to. so going back to the lake more often and going for walks and runs really feels great. also in last week’s episode I decided to review loungewear as lots of us are at home more than usual at the moment and many of you requested that I’d film an episode about ethical activewear. I have to be truly honest, a lot of the activewear I own is old from not sustainable companies and I’ll keep using these until they are worn out. But there is one brand I’ve been testing their activewear for a while that I feel confident reviewing. And that is @organicbasics which I can definitely recommend for anyone doing workouts, pilates or yoga.

user_5;user_514.jpg;a lot of you ask me for « affordable » sustainable brands. first of all, « affordable » means something different for everyone and second, sustainable fashion will never be cheap like fast fashion. why? because the people who make the clothes are being paid fairly and working in safe conditions. also, most sustainable brands use more eco, organic & natural fibers which are more expensive than synthetic fabrics such as polyester. now that we know why sustainable fashion will NEVER be cheap, it’s important to review our shopping habits. by shopping less often, we are able to invest in higher quality pieces that will last overtime and this should be our main focus when it comes to sustainability. another great way to shop sustainably is thrifting, which will always be the cheapest and most affordable way to shop fashion ethically. clothing swaps and upcycling are amazing options too. this year I discovered @naz.fashion and i am so excited to be sharing their new collection with you as i believe these pieces are longterm items that I keep wear every week. the beige shorts everyone asked about is this one also from @naz.fashion . massive sales never happen in sustainable fashion, however, I have a 10% code you can use on your order, it’s CHLOE10. 🦢 . 📷 @perezdavid . #ethicalfashion #ethicallymade #sustainableliving #sustainablefashion #ecofriendly #fairfashionoutfit #ethicalootd #ethicalfashionbrand

user_5;user_516.jpg;1, 2, 3.... do's and don'ts during quarantine  don’t: spend your days on screens hug everyone (this one has been hard for me) buy another fast fashion charity t-shirt do: read books, meditate respect social distancing & try FaceTime photoshoots support small ethical businesses  This time is another opportunity for us to vote with our money and support ethical and sustainable practices. If you’d like to donate to an organisation, please don’t buy another fast fashion t-shirt you don’t need to support a cause. Either support an organisation directly or support a small sustainable company who produces ethically.  @feel_a_fil is an ethical fashion brand based in Switzerland (this is rare!) and came out with this so beautifully knitted shirt made out of organic GOTS certified cotton. It’s made in Germany and the different lines create two interlocking hands. A symbol of solidarity, of helping others, of being together. For every T-shirt sold, FEEL A FIL will donate CHF 25(!!!) to local non-profit organisations and initiatives that are particularly affected by the consequences of the pandemic. In addition, the purchase supports local and small manufacturers who are now struggling with a loss of revenues. It also helps to promote sustainable production ideas, which will become even more important in the future.  Don’t buy a t-shirt you don’t need, don’t feel the pressure of supporting others if you are yourself struggling at the moment. But for everyone who’s in a safe position to give a hand in some way, you can use this opportunity to support ethical organisations & businesses. . 📷 @taniabiland . #ethicalfashion #quarantine #quarantineoutfit #sustainablefashion #fairfashion #fastfashionsucks #ad

user_5;user_526.jpg;This week is Fashion Revolution week. It commemorates the death of 1,138 garment workers at Rana Plaza factory collapse on April 24th 2013 in Bangladesh. This year, because of the pandemic, many brands cancel orders which results in factories closing because they are not receiving payments. Not only are the garment workers unfairly paid, they are now loosing their jobs and have no social support. It’s on us to remember and take action.  No matter where you live, where you’re from, it is our time to raise awareness about the fashion industry, its unfair, impactful practices and ask for transparency.  Let’s ask the companies #whomademyclothes and under which conditions.  Let’s get educated about the fashion industry. I recommend watching @truecostmovie and reading the book Fashionopolis by Dana Thomas. The more educated you are about the topic the more you will be able to identify greenwashing companies and avoid them. Download @goodonyou_app to learn about the different fabrics and the brands ratings in terms of sustainability and ethics.  Follow ethical fashion creators on social media @kristenleo @ethicalandeasy @beatriceturner @heylilahey @letstalkslow @wearilive @ninabotzen @annalaurakummer @venetiafalconer and many more.  Support small sustainable businesses and ethical fashion brands. Use, reuse, repair and upcycle the clothes you already own. Organize a clothing swap (after the quarantine). Buy vintage and second hand. Or even try a shopping ban for a year.  There are many ways to get involved and everyone has an impact.  Check out fashion revolution in your country. Although all physical events are cancelled, there are many online conferences happening and it’s the perfect time to learn something new.  The fashion industry is one of the top polluting industries in the World, let’s make this change! . 📷 @perezdavid 👕 @armedangels 100% Organic cotton, produced fairly and sustainably, all profits goes to National Garment Workers Federation (NGWF) in Bangladesh.

user_5;user_530.jpg;before I started riding bikes, I actually did horse riding for 8 years. I once broke my collarbone and then shortly after I stopped. I was craving something different, so I quit to start training for triathlon. This was way before I went vegan too. I have never done horseback riding since then, It’s been around 10 years I guess. I don’t miss it, but I loved the connection with the horses and just animals in general. They’re such wise beings 🐴 . 📷: @perezdavid . #horsesofinstagram #horse #switzerland #cyclinglife #cyclingswitzerland #cyclinggirl
user_5;user_531.jpg;sunshine, books & journals. as much as I am used to this home office thing, I’ve had such a hard time sticking to a strict schedule lately. And that’s ok. I may be productive one day and not the next. I may be productive for an hour and not the next. My time in Bali, my birth chart reading with @heynikkijae and this current situation have taught me to listen to my own internal rhythm. Yet, I still have a hard time. It’s difficult for me not to have a sense of structure in my life and simply following my intuition in the moment. I work best when I have some sort of routine and vision. I’ve always been super organized and disciplined and I should not see this as something negative either. Navigating between personal discipline (what my mind tells me to do) and inner intuition (what my heart tells me to do) is not easy but I’ve learnt that neither go without the other.
user_5;user_532.jpg;i’ve been taking things slow, waking up whenever i felt truly rested, practicing yoga and meditation almost everyday, reading tonsssss (i never thought i could read this much this fast), cooking healthy foods, drinking warm teas, taking hot and cold showers, whatever feels right, getting some things done, going for walks, creating videos, listening to myself more than ever and letting go of guilt and resistance. i am learning to really live intuitively and it feels amazing. . 📷 @perezdavid 👕 @_lu_cie_e . #slowlife #slowliving #slowdown #yoga #yogapractice #yogaeverydamnday #meditation #readingtime #quarantine #quarantineandchill

user_5;user_539.jpg;i think we might have seen parts of Bali close to like it used to be ten or twenty years ago. Because of low season and the virus (especially) many of the places we stayed at we were the only guests and although it was the best experiencing the island without too many tourists, my heart aches for the people here who are and will be suffering from the virus outbreak. Despite the current situation, coming here was a reality check about my privilege as well. I don’t believe in luck generally speaking, but lucky is what I deeply felt all this trip. Lucky, privileged and endlessly grateful for our time here. For the people we met, the ones that drove us places, the ones that cooked for us and the ones that hosted us. 🤍 . #bali #thankful #grateful #gratitude #travel #indonesia
user_5;user_540.jpg;Everything I read, listen to or watch online talks about the virus and although I’d love to talk about many other things than this right now, I feel the need to share about the situation and what’s happening for us as I can’t deny it affecting our travels. For those who called me irresponsible for traveling during these times, David and I left before the situation escalated. There was no way for us to know back then this was going to happen. Also, I think that there are definitely smarter things to do at this point (and always) than judging people online, instead maybe we should start (finally) supporting and caring for each others. Our flight home is tomorrow and now that Shengen has closed its boarders, it doesn’t make sense to try and get another flight even earlier. Swiss government says to go home asap and Swiss citizens will be allowed in the country (from what I understood) The main issue is flights and the government here in Bali if they decide to shut down everything. I will keep you guys posted. Hope everyone is safe and healthy at home 🤍 and for those currently traveling, you are not alone, call your airlines, call the embassy to get more information. . 📷 @perezdavid . #coronavirusbali #coronavirusswitzerland

user_5;user_548.jpg;We heard so many things about the Gilis (good and bad) that we thought let’s go and see for ourselves. We even decided last minute to go to Gili Meno and Gili Air instead of just one. The first few days on Gili Meno were lovely & quiet. The beaches on Meno are clean, the sand is white and there were very very few people (low season and corona panic consequences I guess). 🥥 The island is small so you can get everywhere super fast (especially with a bike). I will write on the blog a bit more about my thoughts once I come back and have some time to reflect on it. Anyways, it was nice going to the beach and not having anything else to do for a day on Meno besides reading books and snorkeling. 🏝 . 📷 @perezdavid 🏠 @meno.island.villas . #giliislands #gilimeno #gili #indonesia

user_5;user_550.jpg;had such a lovely time spending the first part of our trip in the center of Bali. at the beginning of the week we stayed in @baliecostay for a few days and we had such a lovely time. being away from busy Ubud, we took time to just rest, read and go for walks. the food at @baliecostay was so fresh and delicious! a lot of the food we ate is actually grown on the property, I had never seen such an abondance of tropical fruit trees in my life. we were even given a tour of the permaculture garden and it was so interesting learning about this as David and I both want to grow more fruits and veggies this coming Spring 🌱. do you guys grow your own food? let us know which ones! . 📷 @perezdavid . #bali #baliindonesia #baliecostay #ecofriendly #permaculture #ecoresort #gardening #gardeninglife #swing
user_5;user_551.jpg;This weekend we treated ourselves to a stay at @fivelementsretreat and it was the most luxurious act of self-care I’ve had in a very long time. We had a full afternoon of massage, body scrub and infused bath by the river, followed by a delicious vegan dinner. The next morning we woke up to a sunny day and took a synergy yoga class. Had some green juice and dragon fruit smoothie bowl (one of the best I’ve ever had) and spent time at the pool. It was such a treat and although there are many things I don’t indulge in, staying in beautiful places is one of a few exceptions. . 📷 @perezdavid 👙 @wdlk 🏠 @fivelementsretreat . #fivelementsbali #bali #indonesia #fivelementsretreats #selfcare #treatyourself #spaday #wellness #retreatyourself

user_5;user_555.jpg;David and I fell in love with this little place of paradise. We arrived in Bali a few days ago and one of my main concern coming here was to avoid crowded and very touristy areas as much as possible, so we could enjoy nature and get a sense of the local culture here. The village of Sebatu is located a few kms north of Ubud, and believe me or not, we did not see one single tourist in this village. The area is so lush and we have been loving this jungle life, falling asleep with the frog and cricket sounds and waking up with rooster cry every morning. It is low season at the moment and the Corona virus has made many tourists scared to travel. We have been taking precautions and we are so happy to be here, we absolutely don’t regret it at all. We have been staying at @sebatusanctuary for the last couple days and it’s actually our first time in a Eco Resort, which means they are actively committing to reduce their environmental impact. For example, they eliminate as much as possible single use plastic by serving their guests water in glass bottles always, they reduce at least half of electricity usage thanks to solar energy.

user_5;user_559.jpg;almost finished reading my second book of 2020 already. The Four Agreements had been on my list for so long and I finally took the time to dive in. It’s so easy to read and I’ve got only one thing to say about it: I wish our childhoods innoncence and truth remained with all of us by default. No assumptions, no fears.

user_5;user_561.jpg;time to take care of our skins... 💭  I’ve been testing the @cosmetiques_yemanja products only since beginning of December and my skin has been feeling amazing using these. The products are made in Switzerland, all the ingredients are ethically sourced, organic and vegan. From personal experience, I’ve never seen such « clean » products on the market so far, and they are all fragrance free.  As someone with combination skin, I have been using the BALANCE line and my skin has been a lot more resilient with me. It looks hydrated without feeling oily and all products are very gentle, they did not cause me any irritation.  Skin issues stem from many different factors and two things that I have personally noticed tend to affect my skin are my cycle and gluten. And in this case, skincare will most likely not be enough to heal your skin to a deeper lever. However, what you put on your skin can drastically improve your skin by supporting with the healing process.  Finally @cosmetiques_yemanja also collects their all glass packaging when you are done with the products. You can simply return the empty bottles back to any shop in Switzerland that sells @cosmetiques_yemanja to recycle the containers. ♻️ Want to try the @cosmetiques_yemanja too? Enter the giveaway to win the following products: • Elixir Light Complexion • Mini Hydrating Cream • Balance Serum • Balance Solution (all these are part of my daily routine atm and I truly love them)  To enter: ☁️ say 3 things you are grateful for today ☁️ tag a friend you want to see more  Good luck!!! 🤍 . 📷 @taniabiland . #skincare #giveaway #naturalbeauty #naturalskincare #veganskincare
user_5;user_562.jpg;My go to outfit is always a white tee and a pair of denim. Denims are timeless and versatile. They are resistant and usually last forever. They never go out of trend, ever. But denim production hides a very dirty industry. In fact, conventional cotton crops implies the use of monocultures, toxic fertilizers and harmful pesticides. Denim manufacturing also consumes an shocking amount of water. On average, 7,600liters of water just to make one single pair!!! And to make it even worse, the denim industry uses all sorts of nasty processes such as chlorine bleaching, sand blasting to name a few. Hazardous chemicals are extremely common when adopting these techniques, which not only are polluting the water stream of a the geographic area but also contribute to making the working conditions even worse than they already are. Garment workers are putting their lives at risk every single day for us to buy cheap clothing and this makes me so angry. It’s time to wake up and support companies that are doing something good, even if we have to buy less to afford these! It is our job and responsibility to pay the true cost for what we want and need. No one should be suffering directly or indirectly for the clothes WE wear. Shopping less is the first thing to do. And if you need a pair of jeans make sure of these three things: - they are made out of GOTS certified organic cotton - their production didn’t require the use of harmful chemicals - they were made in safe and fair conditions . Let’s invest in higher quality instead of quantity. Let’s invest in companies that focus on values instead of profit. . 👖 @armedangels « DetoxArmyChloe » for 15% off (valid until 18.02) 📷 @taniabiland . #DetoxArmy #DetoxDenim #armedangels #sustainablefashion #ethicalfashion #ethicallymade #sustainableclothing #sustainableliving #fairfashion #fairfashionootd #fairfashionblogger #slowfashion #swissblogger

user_5;user_571.jpg;currently reading in bed getting ready to relax over the holidays. I haven’t taken many breaks from work over the last few years. I was always either studying, working on uni projects, side jobs and youtube whenever I had free time. I always took my laptop everywhere even if I only was away for 24h to answer emails and use my travel time « efficiently ». I finished school in May and started working full time for myself straight after and didn’t take any Summer holidays. Trust me it’s not easy to let go of your job when you love it so much and feel so lucky and privileged to make a living from my passion. It’s not easy to take time off when everything relies on just you and there will be no one else than myself to upload new videos on my channel while I take a break. And this is why I’ve pushed through, created a strict schedule and routine for myself and sticked to it. There will still be videos coming during the holidays, and I’m excited for every single one of them. But I will also spend a few days away from my phone and social media to start 2020 fresh and inspired. I started reading this book so I will be reminded to read and unwind during the holidays. It’s called « The Women Who Stole My Life » by Marian Keyes. I have no idea if it’s good, but it’s not the point. The point is to take it slow and relax, because after all, that’s what the holidays are for. What book(s) did you pick for the holidays? 📖 . #bookstagram #booklover #unwind #meditation #timeoff #metime

user_5;user_579.jpg;if I could talk to my younger self, I would tell 16yo me that loving yourself is not something you once manage to do and then it just stays forever. It’s a never ending journey of self-care and taking loving decisions for your well being. That taking care of yourself is not only about your physical appearance but mainly about your mindset. The way you perceive yourself will change over the years and you will learn to accept yourself the way you are without caring about other people’s opinion anymore. It’s about feeling good with yourself, physically and mentally. And it’s not easy every day but be patient because it’s worth the time and effort. Over the years I’ve put “feeling good” as part of my daily priorities and I make sure to add at least one activity every day that I know will affect my well being positively. So wether it’s running for an hour, making green juice or doing a 5 minute meditation, I will do it. . 📷 @taniabiland 👙 @dorina_official . #LoveYourCurves #DorinaLingerie #DorinaSwim #DorinaActive #ad #zalandostyle #selflove #selfcare #loveyourself #loveyourbody

user_5;user_582.jpg;if you know me, you know how much i love vintage clothes. clothes that have a story already and giving them a second/third/fourth life. In my opinion, nothing is more sustainable than reusing clothes that would otherwise be thrown onto landfills, wether they’re clothes from your wardrobe or from other people or second hand stores. Second hand fashion isn’t marketed as much as sustainable fashion brands are. And this is a shame. So I got so excited when Justine from @cocktail_brut offered me to do a little vintage piece giveaway on here. (the winner will be able to pick one vintage item of her choice from @cocktail_brut) To enter you have to: - follow @cocktail_brut - follow @beweardocumentary (my passion project) - comment something you’re thankful for today 🧡  winner will be picked and announced this Sunday 17.11 in my stories 🥳 . 📷 @cocktail_brut . #vintage #vintageclothing #vintagefashion #giveaway #ethicalfashion
user_5;user_583.jpg;this time of my life when I had no idea what CO2 emissions even were and travelled the world.🌴 oh well, what an innocent lovely period of my life! Now that I’m aware, I question myself twice before hopping on a plane and it’s never an easy decision. But I try not to be too hard on myself either, because let’s be honest, I’m not going to stop travelling all together either. I just do it a lot less often and in a more mindful way. I believe I have a lot of positive habits regarding sustainability in my daily life and I do not feel bad for flying once or twice a year as transportation is only one aspect of sustainability. I think that whatever you do, as long as you are conscious and feel fine with it then it’s the way to go. We can keep eco shaming each others for what we’re not doing perfect yet (and might never do) but I think that if we all just let each others take our own decisions without constantly judging, we’d all be encouraged to have a positive impact. That’s my opinion. 🌎 What do you think? . #sustainability #sustainableliving #lessflying #mindfultravel #mindfulliving #conscioustravel #consciousliving
user_5;user_584.jpg;In my opinion, ethics are part of sustainability. Ethics for the earth, the people and the animals 🌎 This is why I get very skeptical when « sustainable » brands use leather in their garments for example. But there is hope. With all the new inventions coming out we really no longer need to kill animals for food but also for clothes and accessories. Have you ever heard about mushroom leather, cactus leather, apple skin leather or even pineapple leather? Until last week, I still only owned two belts that I picked from my mom’s closet (which I would encourage anyone to do, or shop vintage). Now, I’m a proud Piñatex (pineapple leather) belt and shoes owner 🍍 @theforwardlab (jeans and turtleneck are both thrifted) Oh and by the way, this is our kitchen, and Marius, our new cactus 🌵 . 📷 @taniabiland . #pinatex #piñatex #pineappleleather #veganleather #veganshoes #veganbelt #veganfashion #sustainablefashion #ethicalfashion #allwhiteoutfit #monochromeoutfit #ethicalootd

user_5;user_592.jpg;after three years of persistence and hard work I’m so happy to say I’m finally done with school, and this time probably for a while.. studying film 🎞 was one of the best decisions and although I never identified myself as the artsy kid, I ended up starting a creative career. I still remember so vividly the day I told my parents I was quitting Health Sciences school to go study film in Berlin. It was for sure not the easiest choice to make and it was even harder to convince them it was the right thing for me. But after three years of seeing me thriving in what I do, they were so proud and happy to see me graduate, now fully supportive of what I do.  What I personally take back from film school is the people I met along the way, the projects I worked on and everything I learnt from the moments of stress, fear and self-doubt. Even though I do not give high importance to official degrees and diplomas, I am forever grateful I was able to study (first of all) something I love (second of all). Finally, I shared a video on my french channel regarding studying abroad and previously also did a Q&A in English about film school if you’re interested. Who’s graduating or has graduted this year as well? and what are you guys studying? 👩🏼‍🎓 . 📷 @perezdavid . #filmschool #dbsberlin #berlin #unistudent #graduation #filmmaking #collegegraduation #collegelife #filmstudies #degreestudent #filmstudent

user_5;user_596.jpg;my skin was flawless until I turned 19 yo and then for a few years I started struggling with hormonal acne. I still am although it has improved so so much. Before I got acne I never would really understand when my friends would complain about their skin breaking out and I thought it’s not that important anyways. But when I started getting acne I realized how much it started affected my sense of self-worth and confidence. Along these years I’ve tried a few things that worked for me: • avoiding processed foods (sugar/oil) focusing on whole foods plant based 🌱 • eating gluten-free (my digestion is thanking me as well, not just my skin) 🍞  And here are some other factors that have also played a role in the health of my skin: • eating lots of greens 🥬 • eating lots of fruit and berries everyday • exercising regularly • spending more time in nature • reducing stress (w/ meditation and yoga) • having a simple & natural skincare routine • stop touching my skin (still learning with this one) • adding superfoods and herbs @ateliernubio to my diet to support my elimination organs (colon, kidneys and the skin)  In my experience, superfoods and herbal supplements are not miracle products. Yes, they do for sure provide your body healthy nutrients and help with detoxification. However, they’re not going to suddenly make your skin glow if you don’t pay attention to your lifestyle and habits as a whole. Every aspect of your external and internal life has an impact on your health. I’ve been taking @ateliernubio plants for the skin for over a month now and although they did not make all my breakouts miraculously disappear, they did help my skin heal faster. This what I’ve experienced but you might notice different benefits. If you’d like to try for yourself you can follow the next steps in order to receive the formula as a gift: • follow @ateliernubio • follow me @user_5 • comment your best beauty ritual ❤️ Randomly picking a winner on Friday.

user_5;user_597.jpg;This is the first year since I was a kid that I’m not going back to school in September. It feels weird to be staying in Switzerland as it used to be the time I’d fly back to Berlin for uni. I was always a good student (I think?!) but I was also very stubborn and upfront about what I wanted for myself. For the past 5 years, I visualized what my dream job would be like after graduating, working everyday a little bit towards this direction. And all I can tell you now is that this journey of waking up at 5 or 6am to work on my YouTube videos before heading to class has paid off and omg it was worth the pain. I love how much freedom and challenges my job offers me and I would never trade it for the stability of a 9-5. I’m able to work from home or from anywhere else I’d like to be. Sometimes I work in cafes and meet up with people. I commute by bike whenever possible and carry a leather-free vegan backpack @fitzandhuxley , which is always filled with all my camera gear, too many notebooks and my laptop. If you’re not happy where you are right now, take 3 minutes everyday to close your eyes and visualize your dream life. And then take every actions and decisions to bring you closer to it. No matter how long it might take you, hard work always pays off eventually.

user_5;user_5101.jpg;As a vegan and sustainable fashion lover, I refuse to buy newly made leather from fast and sustainable brands. I believe leather isn’t an ethical fabric and as ethics are part of sustainability it is therefore not sustainable. The only reason why I still here and there wear leather shoes or bags is because I’ve either bought them second hand or have owned them since years before I turned vegan. I believe that in 2019 we know enough to produce high quality and resistant shoes without using dead animal skins. A month ago I discovered apple leather (made out of apple pulp and skin leftover from the juice industry) which is 100% vegan and doesn’t compromise in quality. These sandals from @zoastoreofficial a 100% ethical and vegan marketplace for accessories and cosmetics. These shoes are made out of apple waste, yet they look and feel like real leather.

user_5;user_5104.jpg;i’ve been keeping this secret since april and now i can finally share this with you! 🙈 i designed a sustainable bikini in collaboration with @liljathelabel . it’s made of plastic bottles and fishing nets found in the ocean. it’s produced ethically in a small family business in Indonesia where everyone gets paid fair living wages. and lastly, the bikini is versatile since you can wear it two ways. check out @liljathelabel website for more info ❤️ can’t wait to see you guys photos wearing this cutie! . 📷 @perezdavid . #ethicalfashion #econyl #sustainablefashion

user_5;user_5107.jpg;someone: why do you only wear white? me: 🤔  tbh i’m very picky when it comes to colors. i get tired of them real quick and when it comes to clothes i want to invest in pieces that i will keep forever because way too much textile is being thrown away, polluting our environment. at a point in my life i was wearing lots of black, and still do somedays in the winter. however i no longer associate with the person i use to be when wearing darker colors. maybe the fact that i’m a lot more at peace with myself now is simply being reflected by the way i dress. but if you know me well, you know i’m not the humane form of peace and calmness either. my mood evolves and changes so fast some days that even David has a hard time keeping up. it’s the same with clothes. some days i don’t want to be seen, some days i want to make a statement. but one thing always stays, i want my clothes to be either second hand or produced sustainably and ethically.  deadstock silk dress by @taiyo_us . 📷 @henrigogniat . #sustainablefashion #sustainability #ethicalfashion #ethicalclothing #switzerland #ootd #ethicalootd #fairfashion #slowfashion #upcycledclothing
user_5;user_5108.jpg;this weekend i made the conscious decision not to touch my phone for 24 hours.  ever since i started putting all my heart and soul into making videos and youtube and sharing my life as a diary here i always had this urge, this feeling that i had to keep a certain rhythm to keep growing, always at the pursuit for more. i’m the type of person who’ll do anything it takes to get what i want and i wanted so hard to make this my job that i was ready for anything. i would wake up at 6am (sometimes 4-5am even) to edit videos before heading to uni or work at 10. i would work on it during lunch breaks, on weekends without ever taking time away from it fully. social media has become and is my job for now. all these years of studying and working side jobs and doing social media have taught me to be disciplined with my time, to use it efficiently. but when it comes to the amount of time i was spending on my phone, there was still a lot of it that was “unnecessary” or should i say it didn’t fulfill me. i get easily trapped into watching stories and scrolling down and im sure i am not the only one here. i already downsized the number of accounts i follow to focus more on my work and life and it’s helped but still i somehow never fully disconnected. although it was something i wanted to do for so long.  on saturday i decided i was going to have a phone free day. and not only was is great and very easy, it was also very eye opening regarding the way i use my phone on a daily basis. although i do spend some productive time on my phone for work, majority of it isn’t. and this mostly because of social media. instagram and youtube are the two apps i get lost on.  now that im back using my phone, i want to create a system to check my phone only 2-3 times a day for less than 1h/day in total. i’m going to set alarms tomorrow to define time frames to use my phone and we’ll see if that works. if you have any method or tips to share please let me know... 💋 . #digitaldetox #digitalminimalism
user_5;user_5109.jpg;slept in and spent the rest of the day in the mountains with @perezdavid . ⛰ this is where i feel most alive, where i come home at the end of the day starving and exhausted like a kid who played outside all day. just ate two vegan burgers with fries and now i’m so ready for bed. 💤 . 📷 @perezdavid . #hiking #switzerland #hikingswitzerland #hike #trailrunning #swiss #swissalps #mountains #mountainlife
user_5;user_5110.jpg;David helped me redecorate my room last week and I’m so excited to share this new vlog with you (link in bio). We added these three frames from @desenio just above my desk and it ties this area of my room so well. so so happy with how it came out✨ And you know what the coolest part is? @desenio plants 2 trees 🌳 for each tree used for paper/frames on top of sourcing their wood only from certified farms. For those of you who are looking to add new art and redecorate your home, I decided to partner up with @desenio to offer you guys 25% off posters* with the code “CHLOEKIAN25” on all of their website until August 15th. *Except for frames and for handpicked and personalized posters.

user_5;user_5111.jpg;i love love love mondays because i am so excited to get as much work done as possible and clear up all my schedule to just catch up on things. feeling on time with things or even ahead of things on Mondays is the best feeling ever. ✨ hope you all had a great start! also, before you ask, this dress is from @zara, a place i no longer shop at which has now officially become a greenwashing temple. i own and wear it since 8 years. i wonder how many people who bought that same dress 8 years ago still own and wear it... don’t throw your fast fashion pieces in the trash, keep wearing them or find them a new home if they no longer serve you. and when you need something new to replace it, take a better decision and buy second hand or from an ethical brand 🧡 at least that how i see it and how i do it. 😊 . 📷 @perezdavid . #ethicalfashion #sustainablefashion #fairfashion #ethicalclothing #sustainability #sustainableliving #minimalism #secondhand #vintageclothing #veganshoes #veganleather

user_5;user_5113.jpg;after last year’s 32km +2200m trail run race with my mom, we decided to take it a bit easier this year and sign up for a 16km +700m one instead. it was very last minute and so happy we did it. it was such a great race and gorgeous scenery. ⛰ couldn’t have thought of any better way to spend this Sunday than outside in the mountains!  When it comes to my running gear/clothes, i get asked all the time through DMs what brands I use and if I also look for sustainable alternatives. Buying second hand performance running/cycling clothes can be tricky since the selection is often non existent or very limited. To be truly honest with you guys, performance running clothes are hardly ever made sustainably. The material used for breathable workout gear is polyester, which is a form of plastic. The best option I’ve found for more sustainable workout clothes are made out of recycled polyester like this top which you can find on @vepsi_official . It’s worth getting just a few quality ones and then using them for years. Personally that’s what i do and these clothes usually last forever. I’ve been wearing this top non stop for running, it’s super light and comfy! 🏃🏽‍♀️ . #trailrunning #trail #trailrunner #thyondixence2019 #running #runnersofinstagram #runner #runnergirl #vepsiambassador

user_5;user_5116.jpg;i started reading again 📖 and i love it so much. i read a lot of self help books last year and then stopped after the summer as i got caught up with college, travelling and moving out of berlin. there are many spots here in switzerland where you can donate books and take new ones with you (usually old phone cabins). I have to say this book sharing thing is amazing when you dont want to end up with piles of already read books in your house. it’s also a great way to read something new or different from what you’re used to. what are you reading these days? any book recommendations? 📚 . #bookstagram #books #bookclub #readingnook #reading #selfhelp #selfhelpbooks #novel

user_5;user_5121.jpg;“The most sustainable clothes you can find are the ones you already own.” So last week I rediscovered a closet full of vintage clothes that my mom use to wear 30 years ago (JACKPOT🎊). I literally took everything out to try it on. If you’ve never had a look in your parents’ closet then maybe this video will make you change your mind.

user_5;user_5122.jpg;« Fair fashion is too expensive »  This is something I hear often, so here are a few sustainable alternatives to fast fashion for those on a really tight budget.  REUSE the clothes you already have in your closet or even your friends/family’s which they no longer wear or fit in. There have been items that I started wearing and loving again after years of being untouched in my closet. Give those items a chance! SWAP your clothes with your friends/family or through @bigsisterswap . Swapping is a great way to wear new clothes and change your outfits without expending the size of your closet either!  UPCYCLE your old clothes to make them attractive again. Change the buttons of a cardigan, crop a large sweater, dye a stained dress, make a tote bag out of an old shirt and use the leftover fabric to create scrunchies. I reckon upcycling requires some time and effort, but trust me, if I can do it you can too. There are so many upcycling DIYs on YouTube without even a sewing machine. This is a great way to avoid textile waste and prolong the life of your garment!  THRIFT clothes at flea markets, secondhand stores and vintage stores. Check out your local charity shops and start digging. You will be amazed by how many cool items you’ll find in there! If you don’t have access to thrift stores, you can also check out @depop , @kleiderkreisel (for germany), @vinted or @poshmark for some online vintage finds!  Finally, there are some fair fashion brands who are more affordable than others such as @everlane @peopletreeuk @organicbasics . It also comes down to how we spend our money and consume in general. Buying sustainably also means buying more consciously and consuming less. If we all bought less things and only what we really needed, a lot more of us could afford to shop from sustainable brands. What are your favorite sustainable brands?👇🏽 . 📷 @_lu_cie_e . #sustainablefashion #sustainability #vepsiambassador #thrifting #ethicalfashion #secondhand #vintageclothing #fastfashionsucks #thetruecost
user_5;user_5123.jpg;First day at @neonyt.berlin with @vepsi_official is over already! This morning we participated to a SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Lookbook Challenge. The two SDG we picked were: 1. Gender Equality 2. Quality Education We had to pick brands which fullfilled at least one of these two goals and here are the two outfits @ninabotzen and I put together. I really fell in love with this jumpsuit from @danyaweevers which I paired with a bag from @mama.tierra and slippers from @aburycollection . Fashion is an industry we cannot ignore if we care about sustainability.

user_5;user_5141.jpg;morning yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️ is something I haven’t practiced so consistently lately with finishing school, moving out, moving in, sorting my life, and starting triahtlon training again. Now I am finally creating a more balanced routine for myself again with meditation, yoga and stretching. It helps me be more calm and grounded. Ask @perezdavid, he’ll tell you I get less angry and am way more peaceful when including these habits in my life. We started meditating again at night for 10-15min before sleeping and I already love it. Yoga and stretching is very beneficial when it comes to muscle recovery and flexibility. I was so nervous going back to swimming training yesterday morning because I hadn’t trained in a few years and thought i had lost everything. But in the end, I was able to follow the group for the whole hour and didnt get dropped once. I could feel my core and back where still strong 💪🏽 and all the yoga i did over these past years in Berlin is definitely for something! . 🧘🏽‍♀️: @thy_halo . #yoga #yogapants #yogaposes #yogagirl #yogalife #ethicalfashion

user_5;user_5157.jpg;it’s so good to be back in Switzerland and make this place feel like home again. for me this always starts with surrounding myself with my essentials. replacing these small things I use everyday by more eco friendly alternatives. a bamboo thoothbrush instead of a plastic one, solid soap instead of liquid bottled one. I am someone who hardly ever buys cosmetics, my tooth/body/skin care routines are mostly waste free and super simple. I’m super excited about these zero waste and vegan alternatives from @hydrophil_com and I’ve discovered some new eco friendly products like the Conjac sponge to wash my face in the morning. I believe sustainability can start anywhere in our lives, even in out bathrooms. Having a lower impact is accessible to anyone and perfectionism shouldn’t be the reason why we don’t even start somewhere in the first place.💭 @hydrophil_com #hydrophil . #sustainable #sustainability #sustainableliving #lowimpactliving #lowimpactlifestyle #lowimpactmovement #sustainablelifestyle #ecofriendly #zerowaste #zerowasteliving
user_5;user_5158.jpg;with @fash_rev around the corner i thought i’d share some of my favorite thrifted pieces & outfits. this cream linen shirt is probably my most worn piece of my whole closet, it’s so comfortable and high quality. i bought it at a second hand store in Berlin. same for these light yellow high waisted shorts from @gap, also thrifted 2 years ago. the swimsuit i reused from my mom and it was originally from @hm (which ironically just came out with a new « conscious » bullshit collection again..) buying fast fashion from second hand stores or even reusing is totally ok in my opinion since this would have all been shipped to Africa and dumped into landfills. just to give you an idea, small tiny Switzerland itself throws away 50,000 tons of textile waste per year.. so before you buy new clothes again, ask yourself twice wether you really need it because oftentimes, you really don’t. . 📷 @gentiankadrijaj . #whomademyclothes #fashionrevolution #ethicalfashion #sustainablefashion #ootdfashion #oootd #ethicalootd #secondhand #thriftstorefinds #fastfashionsucks

user_5;user_5165.jpg;where did the last three years just go? as excited as i am for future adventures, it’s hard to believe my life in Berlin is going to be over soon. listening to my intuition for this one and letting myself go wherever feels right (and fun). after 2 years of travelling and 3 years in Berlin and 3 moves i feel ready to be home for a bit. so many chapters are coming to an end soon, while many more others are still blank for me to write the story. and i’m telling you, it’s gonna be a good one 🖤 . 📷 @gui.mancuso . #berlin #tempelhoferfeld #ethicalfashion #ethicalclothing #organiccotton #fairfashion #sustainablefashion

user_5;user_5169.jpg;It’s always such great news to discover upcoming fair fashion companies and especially here in Switzerland 🇨🇭! This weekend I had the honor to meet up with @diffairfashion team in Zürich and try their first collection (which I am in love with!). @diffairfashion is a Swiss fair fashion brand who supports local tailors and designers. All their clothing is made with 100% natural fibers and no animal based fabrics. Another thing that’s so unique about @diffairfashion is that all their clothing is produced according to the demand and to your personal measurements to avoid textile waste. How cool is that? ✨ Check out their crowdfunding campaign and the new collection by clicking the link in my bio! . 👕 @diffairfashion 📷 @pascalewidmer . #fairfashion #fairfashionblogger #fairfashionootd #fair #sustainablefashion #sustainability #sustainable #sustainableliving #sustainableclothing #slowfashion #ethicalfashion #ethicalclothing #ethicalootd

user_5;user_5186.jpg;#tbt exactly a week ago, picking up trash at the beach in Athens after my morning run with @kristenleo . 90% of the trash we picked was plastic straws, which are slowly but surely finally being forbidden in some European countries. At home I have some stainless steel straws from @yummiiyummiiuniverse which i love using for smoothies.

user_5;user_5187.jpg;spontaneously decided to go to the @berlinale today with @prettygagagirl to watch a documentary about Toritama, a poor city in dry north-eastern Brazil also known as the « capital of jeans ». Did you know that one pair of denim jeans requires over 3000 liters of water to be produced? And water is not the only issue. Denim production involves the use of many pesticides, harmful chemicals (used in the dying process) as well as sandblasting techniques to soften the fabric. “Overall, denim production can cause serious social and environmental consequences” - @goodonyou_app is a great app for you to find brands like @armedangels that produce sustainable and ethical denim. Or you can do like me and get your jeans at the fleamarket and second hand stores. ✨ . 🧥 @humanasecondhandgermany 👖 fleamarket 👞 @dr.martensvegan 📷 @prettygagagirl . #ethicalootd #whomademyclothes #fashionrevolution #filmmaker #fastfashionsucks #ethicalfashion #sustainablefashion #sustainability #denim #jeans #documentary #berlinale #berlinale2019
