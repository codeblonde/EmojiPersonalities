user_33;user_330.jpg;There’s a new video on the tube 🥕 three super delicious and wholesome nourish bowl recipes!⁣ ⁣ When I first started trying to add more whole grains into my meals, I used to find them pretty dry, and bland. To remedy it, I started learning how to flavour the grains, which made it a world of difference. It’s actually one of the only ways I got Robin to start eating brown, red, wild rice, or quinoa 😜⁣ ⁣ So needless to say, the grains in these bowls are flavoured using one simple ingredient, and if you don’t have said ingredient you can always pour overtop a generous serving of the sauce/dressing we share with each recipe, just to flavour it up even more.⁣ ⁣ These bowls are hearty and filling, but feel fresh enough for the warmth of summer ahead.

user_33;user_331.jpg;Just made a couple batches of this almond chocolate overnight oats for our brekkie tomorrow morning. Takes 5 minutes to prep and made with just 5 ingredients. The next morning, top it with your favourite fresh fruit, and you’re good to go! Quick and easy, wholesome and delicious 👉 recipe link in profile 💗 #vegan #breakfast
user_33;user_332.jpg;I can hardly believe it’s been over 5 years since these little fudgy brownie bites made their debut appearance on our blog 😯 it’s one of the first recipes I ever uploaded, and to date still one of my favourites. It’s just 5 ingredients, makes for a super wholesome snack, and these little guys freeze really well too ❄️ I actually prefer eating them straight out of the freezer because then they’re even more dense and fudgy to sink your teeth into 🤤 recipe link on the homepage of user_33.com 🥰 #vegan #plantbased #glutenfree #snacks
user_33;user_333.jpg;There’s a new video on the tube 🤓! It’s actually been quite a while since we’ve made a video in the habit-building realm, and this was the first video that Robin and I have ever made together from start to finish - we hope you enjoy it 👩🏻‍💻⁣ ⁣ In other news, I hope you are all keeping well these days. I know the past months have not been easy for many of us.⁣ ⁣ I just wanted to say thank you so so much for being part of this community and for allowing us to keep making content. Creating content for PUL is a place where I can escape to when things around me feel strange and unknown. I hope it serves as a little escape for you too. A big hug from me to you, wherever in the world you are.
user_33;user_334.jpg;For the last couple weeks I’ve been having the most intense vivid dreams.⁣⁣ ⁣ Historically, I’m someone who either dreams but forgets about it soon after, or some nights I feel like I don’t dream at all, but there’s something about the last couple weeks, and especially last couple days, that are noticeably different. I’m having dreams that feel incredibly real. I remember moment by moment what happens, in intricate detail and in scenarios that feel like they last for hours. They aren’t overly positive or negative, and not about any one thing in particular. It’s all relatively neutral, but it just feels so REAL. I really don’t know what to make of it.⁣⁣ ⁣ The craziest thing is, last night one of the many dreams was that Robin and I went to look at this apartment that had a very NY loft industrial feel - high ceilings, characteristic windows from ceiling to floor, open layout. I woke up and excitedly told Robin about it, and then today, on our bike ride home from the studio, we took a little detour. Strangely enough, we found a building that looked so similar to what I had dreamed, except it was a industrial building for businesses and not homes. What does it mean!? 🤔 why am I dreaming so vividly lately, and why is it seeping into reality? Or am I just giving meaning to nothing?⁣⁣ ⁣ Anyway, it has nothing to do with this burger, but in case you’re interested in devouring it, you can find the recipe on the homepage of our website. It’s a darn yummy burger, that freezes really well in case you want to batch make it for meal prep 🍔⁣ ⁣ Do you give any meaning to your dreams, or do you think it’s a whole lot of nonsense? 🤷🏻‍♀️
user_33;user_335.jpg;There’s a new video on the tube! 🌱 A what I eat in a day video, meal prep edition 👩🏻‍🍳 let me know what you think of the concept and if you’d like to see more videos like this one 🥰 video link in profile 📽⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ And to all the beautiful mummas out there, happy mother’s day 💐
user_33;user_336.jpg;"Hey friends, we’re bringing the PUL E-cookbook back 👩🏻‍🌾⁣ ⁣ Maybe it’s the growing PUL community, or maybe it’s being cozy at home that’s making people want to try new recipes, but we’ve been getting flooded with emails the last few weeks asking if we can bring the E-book back.⁣ ⁣ We launched the E-book in December 2019 to celebrate PUL's 3 year anniversary. It was a way for us to compile all our recipes into one place to share with you, and we are super proud of it! After a couple months, we took it down because new recipes were made on the blog that were not in the E-book (the E-book includes all recipes made up until the end of December 2019), so we at PUL considered it ""out-dated"". But after taking it down, we received so many requests to make it available again, so here it is!⁣ ⁣ If you’re interesting in checking it out, link is in profile 🤗 and for those who already have it, we hope you’ve been enjoying it 🥰 happy cooking! 👩🏻‍🍳 #vegan #plantbased #recipes"
user_33;user_337.jpg;Robin’s asked me to send his thanks for all the lovely messages, we were smiling ear-to-ear reading through them 😁⁣⁣ ⁣ We’ll be back to making content this week (thanks for being so patient), and I can’t to wait share some new recipes in the coming weeks - we’ve got plenty on our list just waiting to be filmed 🤤⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ For now, if you’re meal prepping at all this weekend, consider adding this curry to the list 🙌⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ It’s a recipe we default to often because it’s easy to make, and calls for ingredients we usually have hanging around the house, like potatoes, frozen peas, and coconut milk. If you have a veggie in the fridge that needs using up, like zucchini, mushrooms, or bell peppers, go ahead and toss it in! ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Full recipe link in profile 👩🏻‍🌾 #vegan #curry
user_33;user_338.jpg;I present to you Dr. Robin de Rozario, PhD 👨🏻‍🎓😆🎉!⁣ ⁣ I met Robin in the weeks before he started his PhD. Since then I’ve seen him do and create incredible things. He’s given talks at conferences around the world, he’s given lectures at the university, TA’d classes, and done research project after research project. It all makes me so incredibly proud. In the last 4 years he’s worked so hard, and quoting one of his committee members, “the amount of quality/value of the contributions is impressive.”⁣ ⁣ Yesterday was a precious and peculiar day. In the months before his defense, Robin had planned his graduation ceremony. In the Netherlands, a PhD grad ceremony is like a mini wedding: over a hundred friends, family members, and colleagues attend. We had finalized the venue the party would be at, we drafted the menu with the catering company, we knew who would be playing the music, we had it all sorted... and then the world was put on pause.⁣ ⁣ At first he thought he’d postpone his defense until it was all over, but realizing it could be many months until then, he opted to do his defense digitally.⁣ ⁣ Wearing the traditional ceremonial attire (don’t you love the suit? It makes him look like a pianist 😌) Robin logged in online where he was met by his eight committee members. For an hour, he gave his defense, and was asked questions (see IG story for a sneak peak). At the end of it all, they granted him with his PhD, his supervisor gave a touching speech, and I definitely shed a tear or two.⁣ ⁣ Given that his method of graduating is far from the standard procedure for a PhD, and given he’s the first from his university to graduate digitally, a professional cameraman from the university asked to come take photos (from a considerable distance, of course). The credit goes to him for the beautiful photos in pics #2,3,4 @brainportpixels ⁣ I know it wasn’t the graduation party he was hoping for, but he made the most of it, blazing yet another new path for how things can be done. So so proud of this guy 🎓💝 P.S. his thesis is publicly available online in case there are any smarty pants out there wanting to give it a read - link in profile 🤓
user_33;user_339.jpg;My last couple years of university I didn’t live on campus, so I would commute in by bus. Whether it was by good grace or misfortune (I still can’t decide), there was a coffee shop along the bus route which specialized in making the best, soft, fluffy, warm cinnamon buns 🤤⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Sometimes I’d hop off the bus a few stops before making it to campus to treat myself to a roll, with a cup of coffee, and always an extra serving of icing on the side 😌⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Good grace: because it was absolutely heavenly. Misfortune: because I was spending my tiny bit of student loan “fortune” on my frequent visits 😅⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Fast forward to life in the Netherlands, and I’ve come to learn that cinnamon buns just really aren’t a thing here 🤷🏻‍♀️ so we took it upon ourselves to make a veganized cinnamon bun, to allow me to reminisce and save some dough (😉). Anyone else also find baking to be super therapeutic? 🙋🏻‍♀️⁣ ⁣ Recipe link on the homepage of the PUL website 👩🏻‍🍳 #vegan #pastries #baking
user_33;user_3310.jpg;"I woke this morning in a bit of a slump. I think I was missing family back in Canada, and feeling like I haven't been as productive as usual in the last few weeks with the change of routine. Nothing to complain about - was just noticing my energy felt a bit lower than usual. I also haven’t been working on content creation as much these last few days, which usually gives me a lot of energy, since we’re counting down the days until Robin’s PhD defense (just 4 days to go!). When I create content, I tend to get absorbed by it, and I don’t want to be absent with him right now. I want to be present, helping with the little things: making him a coffee, lunch or dinner, or going on walks with him to clear his head. He’s oddly calm about it all; I think I’m more nervous for the big day than he is 😅⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ When Robin's books came in, I sat down to give the book a read over (mostly flipping, let's be honest, because I don't understand most of it 😜). He had published a little thank you note in there for me that I genuinely didn't expect, and when I read the sweet words he wrote, I had a good cry (see IG stories for a snapshot of the text). We sat and hugged on the couch for a while, and I was just feeling super grateful for the words he shared.⁣ ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ This is a bit more of a vulnerable post to put out there, but I guess I just wanted to share that a small, few, kind words can go a long way to brighten someone’s day. Is there someone you could message right now with some words of gratitude or appreciation? Maybe even just to let them know you’re thinking of them? A sentence or two is all it takes 💗"
user_33;user_3311.jpg;Continuing with our snacking series, I present to you these ultra dense and wholesome orange chocolate oat bars. Batch make ‘em and enjoy ‘em throughout the week. Recipe on the homepage of the PUL website 🍊 #vegan #snacks
user_33;user_3312.jpg;If you’re in need of a little snack inspiration, here’s one of my favourites 🍅⁣⁣ ⁣ I’ve always been a huge fan of vinegar. Fun weird fact: you know those little sachets of ketchup and vinegar you get at fast food restaurants sometimes? Ya, me and my sister used to take “shots” of the little vinegar packets when we were younger. Kind of gross, I know, but the vinegar obsession has always been real.⁣⁣ ⁣ For this recipe I make a rich balsamic reduction, but if you’re not a fan of vinegar you can leave it out entirely. Either way, it’s a fresh, fragrant and flavouful little snack or appetizer. Bon appetit! Recipe on the homepage of the PUL website 🌿 #vegan #snacks
user_33;user_3313.jpg;These loaded sweet potato fries are a labour of love but so worth the effort. Most days, I want a meal that comes together quickly. One pot, few ingredients, and preferably done in 15-minute or less 😜⁣ ⁣ But sometimes, just sometimes, I find it soothing to work my way through a recipe that’s a bit more involved, knowing full well I’m going to relish every bite of it when I’m done. From baking the sweet potatoes, to making the hearty chili, to whipping up the creamy cheese sauce, and finally tossing together the homemade salsa - it’s worth every minute 😌⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Full recipe for these #vegan loaded sweet potato fries are on the homepage of the PUL website!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ What recipe do you like making sometimes that takes a bit more tender love and care? 👩🏻‍🍳
user_33;user_3314.jpg;New video on the tube, all about making more plants from what you might already have 🌿⁣ ⁣ I think I’m officially becoming my mum. Right now, that’s like a dream come true - my mum is the best - but when I was 13, I thought she was a bit crazy. There were little plant pots all over the house, vines of plants crawling up walls, and she was always trying to teach me how to propagate plants, but I didn’t much care for it then.⁣ ⁣ Fast forward to now and I think I might be a tad bit obsessed 😏 There are little jars, vases, and pots all over our home with little plant babies, and the PUL has become my own personal little plant nursery 🌱⁣ ⁣ Considering we’re all spending more time at home, and given it’s spring, this might be one of the best times to start 🌞 #video link in profile!
user_33;user_3315.jpg;The peanut addiction continues 😏This creamy peanut soup calls for staple ingredients you might already have, nothing too fancy. The sweet potatoes makes the soup thick, the coconut milk and peanut butter makes it creamy, and there’s a touch of sweetness from the banana. It might sound super weird to add banana to a soup, but somehow it works. Perfectly. Recipe link in profile 🍌

user_33;user_3321.jpg;Turned 29 years young today 🌿 birthdays have always amused me: I feel the same as I did yesterday, but on this one day I get showered with more love than usual. Haha, I’m not complaining 😜 but to be honest, I‘ve always felt like the love and appreciation should be given to the birthday person’s life-giver. So to that I say, thank you mum! Super glad she’s come for a visit so we could spend this day together 🥰

user_33;user_3324.jpg;Happy birthday to... Pick Up Limes 🥳⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Crazy how time flies. It was 3 years ago that Robin took me into the chamber of commerce in the Netherlands to register PUL as a business. I thought he was a tad crazy, on account of having only just uploaded the first video to the PUL channel a month prior.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ The last 3 years have been an incredible journey, with plenty of ups, and plenty of downs. Through it all, it’s been this community that’s inspired us to continue to grow, evolve, learn, and create every single day. Knowing our recipes are being enjoyed my you, all around the globe, is our biggest gift. And you gift us with that everyday. Thank you 🙏⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ To celebrate, we made a pretty epic vegan chocolate cake - and the #recipe is now on the blog 💃🏻 Comment 🍰 if you want a slice, and we’ll save you the biggest one 😉💋

user_33;user_3327.jpg;"There was one day last week when it was sunny and the flowers were starting to bloom; I didn’t realize how excited spring made me until I felt that gentle sun kiss my skin 🌞 Then it all got taken away: it’s been rainy, windy, and cold in the Netherlands the last few days. Super stormy and moody. Not too fun to be outside, but it makes being inside feel super cozy - or as the Dutch would say, “gezellig” 😌Candles are lit, fairy lights on, and copious amounts of warm tea being imbibed.

user_33;user_3335.jpg;1. Celebrating 1,460 days with this cutie 🥰⁣ 2. Four years ago today, I met Robin on a beach in Thailand. That night, we chatted for hours, and some strangers invited us to learn how to slackline with them. We’ve been hooked ever since ✌🏼⁣ 3. After traveling together in Asia for 6 weeks, we said goodbye thinking we wouldn’t see each other again... but a few weeks later, I was in The Netherlands for the first time ever to visit the boy 🚲⁣ 4. A couple months later, the boy visited Canada for the first time ever. I tried convincing him to stay 🇨🇦⁣ 5. While he was in Vancouver, he tried convincing me to move to the Netherlands, hence the, “everything can be imported [to the netherlands]... even Canadian girls!” 💃🏻⁣ 6. We said our goodbyes at the airport, not knowing when/if we’d see each other again 🥺⁣ 7. A few months later, I moved to the Netherlands, and we got ourselves a tiny little apartment 🏡⁣ 8. Life in Europe wasn’t bad, and traveling was way easier, but I did miss my family something fierce. Living away from what was once “home” is never easy ☀️⁣ 9. Pick Up Limes started to grow, and working out of our little apartment just didn’t make the cut anymore, so we got a studio space for PUL. We poured a lot of hard work into building and making the space ready, and it was worth every minute 🔨⁣ 10. A lot has happened in four years years. Curious what the next four years has in store...❣️For now, the sweet boy has been sick at home all day, so we’ve been chillin’ on the couch, eating oranges. I think it makes for a pretty romantic anniversary 😜

user_33;user_3339.jpg;This #vegan banana bread was one of the first recipes we made for the channel, just under two years ago.

user_33;user_3340.jpg;"You asked for it; so here it is! My very minimal bullet journal spread - NEW #video link in profile 📓🖊🖤⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I got my first ever bullet journal as a Christmas gift last year, and it took me until April to get started with it. The reason for the delay: perfectionism. I had seen so many people create the most beautiful spreads - so artsy and creative - and I was intimidated. I also felt a bit overwhelmed, not knowing where to begin and what pages to create. The best thing I did was to stop thinking and to just put pen to paper. Some pages I created stuck, and I still make them to this day, other pages felt too demanding of my time and energy, so I stopped. That’s the beauty of this system: you can tailor it to your needs at any moment.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Some people bullet journal to express their creativity, others to organize their thoughts, others to plan their days. For me, it serves the function of increasing my productivity, and helping me become more mindful. I hope you enjoy the video 🥰⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ How do you organize your time and to-dos? Bullet journal, another journal, digital planners, apps? I’m curious what’s most common amongst us 🤓"

user_33;user_3346.jpg;Weekends are for pancakes and getting things done ✅⁣⁣ ⁣ Robin and I have spent our morning and afternoon doing a whole apartment declutter by getting rid of things that no longer serve us (worn out clothes, cracked containers, broken electronics).⁣ ⁣ Even though we are really conscious of what we bring into the house, and we really aren’t big spenders, it’s kind of sad to see the amount of “stuff” we’re taking off to the recycle depo or things that are going to the thrift store. In the last couple years I’ve become much for sensitive to the realization that each of us leave such a footprint on this beautiful planet 🌎👣⁣ ⁣ In a time of holiday purchases, just a friendly little reminder to try to go for products that are minimal waste, items that are actually functional, items that can be used for years and years, or the best gift of all: spending quality time with your loved ones 💗⁣ Have a good #minimalwaste gift idea to share? Share in the comments below 🎁⁣ ⁣ #recipe link for these #vegan pancakes on the homepage of the PUL website (www.user_33.com) 🥞
user_33;user_3347.jpg;Oh boy, oh boy, have we got a recipe video for you! Turn on some fairy lights, grab a pull over hoodie and a big bowl, cuz in this video we’re making 5 cozy soups. It’s like a hug in a bowl 🤗. Batch make and freeze for later, take to a potluck to enjoy with company, or cozy up with it alone on the couch 🥰 #video link in profile 🥣
user_33;user_3348.jpg;Anyone else obsessed with beets? I grew up very much despising them. My dad would always steam a bunch to snack on and I used to think it was the weirdest thing ever 😝. I think some day, in some way, we all eventually end up adopting characteristics and habits of our parents... especially the ones we thought were strange. Any trait of your parents you‘ve adopted over time? For the full recipe breakdown, visit the homepage of our website 💗

user_33;user_3350.jpg;Need a wicked weekend dinner idea? Look no further than this creamy #vegan mushroom pasta 🍄 seriously one of my favourite pasta recipes yet, and we’ve had such incredible responses from those of you who’ve made it so far. Visit the PUL blog for the recipe 👩🏻‍🍳⁣ ⁣ Also: I’ve been really enjoying reading the comments on the latest VLOG (link in profile) - I know I don’t share much of my personal life, and if I can be honest, I think it’s because I’m more shy than I might come across. Despite being on camera for nearly 3 years now, I still get nervous each time 😅 but anyway, just wanted to say I’m grateful for all the love and positivity. Thank you 🥰

user_33;user_3355.jpg;Holy guacamole, 2 million!? We’re bringing out the sparklers for that ✨✨✨⁣⁣ ⁣ The number doesn’t amaze me as much as the PEOPLE who make up that number. I’ve had friends tell me time and time again after reading the comments section of our YouTube videos, “Wow, Pick Up Limes has the most friendly and caring supporters on the internet!”⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ I love that together, we’ve created a community of people who are beyond compassionate.

user_33;user_3356.jpg;My day has consisted of snuggling on the couch with a big fluffy blanket, alternating between watching Harry Potter and Friends, all while drinking loads of this #vegan Golden Milk (c’monnn antioxidants, work your magic!) 💛 Robin just got home from work and made me a big pot of soup, and now I’m thinking: the pain and congestion is never fun, but being sick isn’t all that bad sometimes, eh? 😜 What do you usually do, eat or drink when feeling under the weather? 🤧 For the full #recipe see link in profile ✨

user_33;user_3361.jpg;With the days getting shorter and shorter, I’m finding I’d rather spend the dark early mornings snuggled in bed just a liiittle bit longer. We’ve just uploaded a new #video sharing 5 different overnight oats recipes 🖐🏻⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ When breakfast has been prepped the night before, I feel I can afford/deserve the extra few minutes in bed, don’t you think? 😏⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ The recipes are wholesome as always, but also super indulgent. I’d liken it to dessert in a jar... but for brekkie 🤤 Link in profile 🍌⁣⁣ ⁣ Which of the three pics do you think you’d want to try first? 1, 2, or 3? 🧐
user_33;user_3362.jpg;A few years ago, I lost someone incredibly close to me to cancer. It’s something that affects us all, and a hardship no one should have to endure.⁣ ⁣ With October being Breast Cancer Awareness month, we’re supporting @physicianscommittee in sharing their 4-pronged approach to beating breast cancer (not sponsored). We’ve expanded on the topic and written a #new article about it on the blog - link in profile 🌸⁣ ⁣ Take care of yourselves, and each other 💗 #LetsBeatBreastCancer
user_33;user_3363.jpg;Lately, I’ve noticed I’m much more sensitive to the words “I am”. Those two words are so incredibly powerful. They are identifiers: I am Canadian. I am a content creator. I am a daughter, a sister.  But the “I am” statements can also affect our psychological health and well-being if we don’t pay attention, especially when we feel we are failing at something. Then our inner dialogue can change to “I am a failure”. “I am stupid.” “I am unloveable”. There’s a #new video on the tube about how we can become aware of our inner dialogue, and two simple ways we can overcome these feelings of failure. 📽 #video link in profile
user_33;user_3364.jpg;This picture says it all: it was so much fun filming with the ultra-talented @gazoakley from @avantgardevegan 🌱 ⁣⁣ ⁣ Two years ago, only months after starting the PUL channel, YouTube’s algorithm recommended a video to me. It was Gaz’s #vegan fish and chips video, and I was totally captivated. His creativity and skills in the kitchen were remarkable, and when I learned he specialized in making only #vegan recipes, I was completely floored. I had found a little gem. ⁣ ⁣ I had never before emailed a total stranger, but this time I couldn’t resist. I messaged to tell him he would reach incredible heights, and that his recipes were all too inspiring. Who would have thought just two years later, we’d be creating a recipe video together 🥰⁣⁣ ⁣ Head over to the tube to check out our latest #new videos! I share some nutrition info 👩🏻‍🌾 he shares some magical chef skills 👨🏻‍🍳 it’s a good time to be had 😎⁣⁣ ⁣ Video link in profile ✨
user_33;user_3365.jpg;It felt like Friday yesterday. On the one hand, it’s making this week feel incredibly long. On the other hand, I feel like I’m getting so much done with this “extra” day I feel I’ve been given 😂 can anyone else relate?⁣ ⁣ And with that extra time, I’ve gone ahead and posted a new recipe to the blog 👩🏻‍🍳 Our first ever #vegan pulled jackfruit recipe... and I think this one will be the first of many! Featuring a delicious and juicy nectarine salsa to top it with.⁣ ⁣ Getting ready to say goodbye to the summer fruits, though, and hello to all the fall and winter squashes and pumpkins! Any fall recipe requests for us? 🍁🍂
user_33;user_3366.jpg;Ooooh it’s been a hot minute since we’ve shared a Tea Time Tuesday video. Happy to announce there’s a #new TTT video now on the tube! This video’s all about learning to build self-confidence.⁣ ⁣ Sitting and talking to a camera each week, to make a video that would be seen by thousands, was not something I’d ever have signed up for a few years ago. I was the kid who ran away from taking most family pictures because I didn’t like being in front of the camera, and if I had to be in it, I’d just make funny faces because it was the only way I could deal with feeling awkward and uncomfortable. Confidence is not something I think any of us are born with... I really believe it’s something that can be learned.⁣ ⁣ What’s something you’re confident in? And if you’re comfortable to share, what’s something you want to build more confidence in?
user_33;user_3367.jpg;This granola is made with no added oils or sugars - one of my favorite things to meal prep on the weekend! Do you have a go-to item you prep? 👩🏻‍🍳 Right now I’m on my way to the airport to pick up my cousin and her little one who are visiting from Canada. We’ll explore the Netherlands together for a few days, before heading to Germany to visit our other cousin. Growing up, cousins for me were like my siblings - we grew up together and were practically raised by each others’ parents as much as our own. Anyone else have a similar family dynamic? Can’t wait for the family time 🥰, and I’ll be back to posting videos next week, followed by a super exciting collab video - stay tuned!  Granola #recipe link is in profile 🙌

user_33;user_3369.jpg;"I’m in the process of learning Dutch 🇳🇱 • Or more like: I was learning it over a year ago, then stopped completely, but now I have to pick it back up again 😅 My intensive courses start in a month and I reeaaallly have to start practicing again - “ik moet oefenen” 🤓 Everyone in the Netherlands speaks English so darn well that the incentive to learn the language hasn’t been high. But if I want to stay in the country past next June, I’m obligated to learn the language. So let the studying begin; wish me luck! “Wens me geluk!” 💪🏻"

user_33;user_3375.jpg;Why is that when we live in a country we always itch to explore other countries? Why not our own? Lately I’ve been exploring new places here within the Netherlands, and seriously this place is like a dream. Biking around little cities or along canals, this place has its own special kind of beauty 😍 What country do you live in? Do you feel you’ve explored it enough?
user_33;user_3376.jpg;If you’re doing any meal prepping this weekend, might I suggest this quick, 15-minute #vegan curry 👨🏻‍🍳 • Curries are seriously the best. They’re comforting, warm, filling, nutritious... in fact, I love them so much that going to make a video dedicated to just curry recipes 🥳 Do you have any favourites? We’ll try to whip together as many as we can 💃🏻 • 📽 #recipe is in our latest #video 🌻link in profile • TIP: like with most curries, it can be enjoyed right after you make it, but the taste is even better when you’ve given the spices and sauces time to meld. That’s why curries usually taste even better the next day 😏
user_33;user_3377.jpg;NEW VIDEO 👩🏻‍🍳 some quick, delicious and healthy 20-minute #vegan meal ideas 🤤 • This here is a Creamy Peanut Veggie Noodle Stir-fry and it’s Robin’s latest obsession.

It’s Robin and I exploring a beloved city in the Netherlands, with all the goodies we ate the whole day through (aka a “what we ate in a day” video).👨🏻‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳 Getting it live was quite a struggle this time 😅 To start, the video was a beast to edit, then the hard disk drive corrupted and some data was lost, and if that wasn’t enough: I was hoping to post the video at the airport when waiting to board my flight from the Netherlands to Canada, but then learned that I forgot my passport at home (who does that!?). So I missed my flight. With having to buy new tickets and spending nearly two days in transport, I’ve finally arrived to Canada. But will all that was hectic behind me now, the video is live! And so excited for this one too! Hope you guys enjoy it, it was super fun for us to film and make 🕺🏻💃🏻 Video link in profile 🙌

user_33;user_3387.jpg;NEW VIDEO ✨ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Have you ever created a healthy eating goal, but then couldn’t stick with it? In this video we’ll explore which strategies you can use to get unstuck. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ I loved making handouts when I used to work one-on-one with clients. I tried to create handouts in a way that helped them understand their own habits and behaviors better, and handouts that helped them come up with their OWN solutions (as opposed to me or someone else telling them what to do).⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ Sometimes, the reason we can’t stick with our healthy eating goals is because the intrinsic motivation just isn’t there. We feel we “should” be doing it, as opposed to genuinely and passionately wanting to do it. The “will” just isn’t there, or as you know I prefer to say: the “why” just isn’t formulated well enough yet. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ So to accompany this video, I created an extensive PDF that you can use as a guide to help you achieve your healthy eating goals. As always, it’s completely free. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣I hope you find it helpful 💗 ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ 📽 #video link in profile 👩🏻‍🌾⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

I’ve always believed that people generally are good, do good, and want what’s good for others... with each passing day I feel more assured of it through the love and kindness of this community. Thank you for always uplifting me, and each other. Thank you for being here 🌻✨💛"
user_33;user_33103.jpg;✨ NEW VIDEO ✨ • We’ve uploaded 8 new recipes to the blog today, and there are 6 #new recipes shared in the video 💃🏻 these are all breakfast and lunch ideas with just 7-ingredients that take well under 30 minutes to make 😁 • 🥙 #video link in profile 🌻 happy Friday, friends 💕
user_33;user_33104.jpg;For two years we’ve made videos for the tube, but for some reason I haven’t posted videos to IG. Whaddya say to more of these little video snippets? Yay or nay? 🌝 This Heirloom Sweet Potato & Beetroot Soup is one of my favourites, warm and comforting for cold and rainy days like we’ve been having the last couple days ☔️ #recipe link in profile with the full-length video on the blog as well 💗
user_33;user_33105.jpg;new 👩🏻‍🍳 recipe • I remember in high school my mum always gave me a hard time for skipping breakfast. I didn’t feel hungry a lot of the time, and other times I was just running late and it was the last thing on my mind. These days, breakfast is as important a meal to me as the others. Couldn’t miss it or else I’d get hella hangry. What’s your relationship with breakfast like? Do you have it every day 🍌 • This here recipe is for those grab-n-go kinda mornings: for breakfast or as a snack. Wholesome, 10 minutes to prep, freezes well, #vegan and #glutenfree 🍎 • Recipe link in profile 💐 Happy April!
user_33;user_33106.jpg;15-minute dinners x3 🎉 • I honestly LOVE cooking and being in the kitchen, but some days I’m a bit lazy or feeling too busy. I want something yummy and homemade, but I don’t want it to take too long. That’s what this NEW video is all about 👩🏻‍🍳 • The key is to multitask: while something is boiling, you chop something up. While something sautéing, you whip together a sauce. I’ll walk you through the steps when making this Thai Red Curry Noodle Soup with Crispy Tofu, plus we’ll make a taco and pasta dish too 🍜 🌮 🍝 • ✨ #video link in profile 💃🏻
user_33;user_33107.jpg;n e w ☀️ v i d e o • A whole day of eating while on holiday 👩🏻‍🌾: homemade recipes, snacks on-the-go, dinner in the city, and a trip to these beautiful sand dunes 🤩 • 🎥 #video now on the tube, link in profile 💃🏻 what’s your go-to snack when you’re traveling or on the road? 🍎
user_33;user_33108.jpg;It’s 10:30pm and I’m already daydreaming about breakfast. Have you had a #vegan cream cheese before 🥯 • I grew up in Toronto (practically New York’s little sibling) so we had LOADS of bagels and cream cheese when I was growing up. It was practically a staple in our house. I’d always have it with sliced cucumber and tomato, and a sprinkle of salt... ugh, so good 🥒🍅 • Fast forward to now being in the Netherlands where vegan cream cheese isn’t the easiest to come by. So we whipped this together at PUL, and my word I really feel like it tastes better than the original. It takes just 10 minutes to make, #recipe link in profile ☝️ now I’m off to bed to dream about this stuff 🌙 g’night
user_33;user_33109.jpg;n e w ✨ v i d e o • I recently did an Instagram story question asking what kind of videos you guys wanted to see more of. Without a doubt, three topics were most requested: (1) more VLOGS, (2) more what-I-eat-in-a-day videos, (3) quick dinner meal ideas... and to that I say: your wish is my command 😌 • First up, a vlog from this beautiful place on our recent trip to Spain 🇪🇸 Robin and I acting goofy 🤪 epic drone shots while exploring the island 🌴☀️ and a little incident of nearly killing myself... nothing morbid, but just take note from me and be careful out there 😅🙈 • The next two videos will also both be shared within the next week 🙌 but for now, NEW #video link in profile 💃🏻 go go go!
user_33;user_33110.jpg;Anyone up for one (or two or three) of these fudgy, two-bite brownies 🙋🏻‍♀️ • First day of spring, so let’s celebrate with chocolate 🙌 these little guys are refined sugar-free too, sweetened naturally with dates, and made using whole food ingredients💃🏻 especially delicious when enjoyed with some coffee or tea ☕️ • You know the drill: recipe on the blog, link in profile, brownies are in my belly. Happy hump day, and spring, friends 😉💐
user_33;user_33111.jpg;Are you a weekly meal prepper? Comment 👍🏻 for “yes” or 👎🏻 for “no” or 😏 for “not yet but I plan to start” ✨ • And if you were in the 👍🏻 or 😏 category may I suggest trying out this vibrant and delicious chickpea ambrosia (aka food of the gods) 🤤 it’s hard to believe it would taste better than it looks, but I assure you, it’s both sexy and delish 🙌 • 💃🏻 #recipe link in profile 💋
user_33;user_33112.jpg;I have two sisters to whom I look up to incredibly much. My eldest sister, @sarabadiei1 , after having worked as an engineer, left to start working as a humanitarian aid worker in various countries around the globe. She always reminded me of Angelina Jolie, but just a million times more badass 😎 • She’s worked with Doctors Without Borders and The Red Cross: from combating malnutrition and disease outbreaks in Africa, to rebuilding infrastructure for citizens in conflict regions like Gaza & Afghanistan. She’s always been the most incredible role model: caring, compassionate, giving and selfless ✨ • She’s also the sister who had a daughter born nearly 2 months prematurely (remember that vlog?), and despite all her hardships, came out stronger than ever. Fast-forward to today: she’s a Liberal party candidate, working to pave the way for a bright Canadian future. I’m so beyond proud. Sometimes I think she’s a superhero, humbly tucking her cape in under her pants so we don’t see it 🦸🏻‍♀️ • I know our community is global, but if any of you are in the lower mainland of British Columbia, you can show your love and support TOMORROW in Port Moody at her campaign launch 🇨🇦 or just head over to her FB page and say hi (link in bio) 🌻 thanks for being such an incredible example to us all, big sis. Love you 💗 #internationalwomensday #iwd2019
user_33;user_33113.jpg;And just like that, another year came and went ✨ today I turned 20... with 8 years of experience 😜 although I still act like a kid and photobomb my own pictures when I find out Robin is snapping a pic of me... some things will never change 🤓
user_33;user_33114.jpg;h a p p y 🎈 b i r t h d a y... to Pick Up Limes 🥳 • Officially 2 years old today! Technically, our first video launched 2 years and 1 month ago, but I say “officially” because it was 2 years ago today that Robin took me in to the Chamber of Commerce to register PUL as business in the Netherlands 👩🏻‍🌾 • I didn’t really understand why we were registering it at the time. PUL was very much in its infancy, and I had no way of knowing if it was something that could grow into a full time gig for me. Before PUL, I worked as a dietitian, and my dream was always to go to medical school. For almost 10 years I prepped at making that dream come true, and the day it did - the day I got my medical school acceptance letter - was the same day PUL reached 100k subscribers on YT. It was also the same day the Dutch government granted me a 5 year visa to stay in the Netherlands. You’d think I’d be over the moon with all this incredible good news in one day, but to be honest, I broke down crying. I felt like I was at a cross roads in life. I wasn’t sure which decision was the right one: to move back to Canada with my family, and become a doctor 👩🏻‍⚕️ or to stay in the Netherlands with my love, and pursue an unknown career on the World Wide Web 👩🏻‍💻 • You know how the story ended (or should I say, started 🤓), and it was all made possible because of you. I’m so grateful for this community. For this family we’ve created and grown together. Each of you inspires me each day with your tags, comments, emails and presence. I couldn’t have imagined a better outcome, and I have you to thank for making this all possible. So happy birthday to us, and here’s to many more prosperous years ahead 🎂🤗💗🙏
user_33;user_33115.jpg;NEW video 🥰 • You know those few times in your life when you learn a new nugget of information and it totally transforms the way you think and look at things? That’s what happened to me when I learned about the ego. And not the shallow “oh he’s so full of himself 😒” kind of ego. I mean the ego that each and every one of us has inside... the one most of us don’t even know is there. I know I didn’t 🙊 • 📽 #video link in profile 💗
user_33;user_33116.jpg;NEW video 🤤 • How to make hummus 👉 5 ways 🎉 • I’m seriously OBSESSED with hummus, we have it at least once a day as a dip or in a sandwich, wrap or nourish bowl. These recipes are some of my all-time favourites: they’re super easy, wholesome, and perfect to make during meal prep 🙌 • 🍋 #video link in profile, and yupp, more bloopers too 😜💃🏻

user_33;user_33118.jpg;NEW video 😎 • What’s the deal with #sugar? Are fruits okay? What about artificial sweeteners? Is maple syrup better than plain white sugar? Sugar is such a hot topic, and can be a controversial one too. We delve into all the questions above, plus 10 tips on how to manage our sugar intake 💪🏻 #video link in profile 🙌 • aaaaand it’s my first time sharing a blooper reel because way too many people think I speak effortlessly all the time, so let’s demystify that 😜 • What’s your take on the whole sugar thing? 🧐

We can still be super productive and get things done 💪🏻 it’s more about finding balance and the right mindset that lets us slow things down. Ideas and exercises for each day, plus a printable guide 😌 who’s gonna join 🙋🏻‍♀️ • 📽 new #video link in profile 👈🏻
user_33;user_33120.jpg;n e w r e c i p e 🍎 It’s been snowy here the last few days, and the studio has been extra chilly. We can’t control the temperature of the space ourselves, so we’ve been baking up a storm so that the oven heats up the space 🔥 practical and productive: we recipe tested a whole bunch of things today! Some recipes are EPIC (can’t wait to share) and some massively failed 😅 so goes the process of recipe development 😜 and we’ve been making this cider on repeat to stay warm too #cozyvibes ❄️ It’s a simple recipe, just 4 ingredients, but we figured we’d type it up to share in case you’ve never made it before. It’s one of my go-to faves in the fall and winter. Plus, we included two variations: one hot (pictured here) and one sparkling and chilled. It’s the perfect drink for any occasion 💃🏻 #recipe link in profile ✨
user_33;user_33121.jpg;n e w 🎶 v i d e o • Starting a YouTube channel is something I never thought I’d do. Having it grow the way it did is something I never could have imagined. It’s been amazing in so many ways, a true blessing to be able to connect with each and everyone of you 🙏 I’m forever grateful. But the decision to pursue YouTube as a career did not come easily. I fought with the idea for quite a while, and even as it grew there were moments when I was so close to giving it all up. In the #video, made by the amazing team at @epidemicsound and @florian_land , I share why I felt the way I did, and what it took for me to “take the leap” into the unknown territory of becoming an online content creator 👩🏻‍💻Needless to say, I’m so glad I pushed past the discomfort in those earlier days. I can’t imagine things being any other way👩🏻‍🌾💗📽 video link in profile ✨ #theleap #seekdiscomfort #user_33
user_33;user_33122.jpg;"Celebrating 1,096 days with this cutie 🥰 let’s take a little stroll down memory lane, shall we 👇 • Robin and I met on a beach in Thailand 🌴 I sat under the only palm tree providing shelter from the blistering sun, and pulled out my camera to take a picture of the crystal blue waters... but the camera wouldn’t work 📷 It must have gotten water damage on the boat ride over, and it was a brand new one too 💦 😔Trying to fiddle with it, I I heard a voice behind me say, “want me to take a picture for you?” Disgruntled and unamused, I replied no 😒 and those were the first words we exchanged. Romantic isn’t it? 😜 He started a conversation, and then invited me to dinner with his friends. After that we all said farewell; he was leaving the next day 👋 • The next morning I woke up and walked down to the local restaurant for breakfast, and saw him sitting there. He told me he “missed his boat”, and invited me to go rock climbing with him. That was our first unofficial date (see second pic). The next morning he “missed his boat” again. This happened day after day for a week 😅 Eventually I asked if he just wanted to catch the boat together, and he agreed... and that’s how our adventures together began 💃🏻🕺🏻 • Good thing that camera got damaged, eh? 💗"
user_33;user_33123.jpg;My hair set on fire tonight 🔥 true story, no joke. Apparently it was a solid flame making its way up my locks, but I didn’t see it. I only heard it crackle, and heard some people shout. I then smacked my head a couple times to put it out, and subsequently pulled out a couple handfuls of hair 💁🏻‍♀️ Luckily I have a lot of hair, so it hardly made a dent. Have you ever smelled burnt hair? 😂 it’s not a pleasant smell. But it was worth it! I now have cute shorter layers, and it happened on a night out to meet the amazing team of @thehappypear 🍐🍐 These guys are so inspiring ✨ • I came across their content not long after the launch of PUL, and I was overwhelmed by their positive energy 📽 Do you ever wonder if someone’s online persona is how they actually are in real life? I wondered that about them all the time. I can now confirm: it’s not act. Steve & Dave are just a ball of energy and positive vibes all around. Check out their IG & YT for all things #vegan and delicious, like this here sage & thyme burger of theirs 🍔 • And note to anyone with long hair: keep those long locks away from open flames on dinner tables 😅🙈
user_33;user_33124.jpg;n e w 🌱 video 💕 • Last year I read a sign that said “plant lady is the new crazy cat lady”... genius 🤓 I’m guilty as charged! Anyone else a little plant obsessed? For all things green, check out the latest #video 🌿 link in profile 💃🏻 what’s you’re favourite plant? I think mine is the pothos 🍃🥰
user_33;user_33125.jpg;n e w ☕️ r e c i p e 😌 • It’s been one of those rainy-stay-in-on-the-couch-and-cuddle-up-to-watch-some-Netflix kinda days. My drink of choice during such days: this here London Fog. 5 minutes. 5 ingredients. And speaking of Netflix, anyone watch the new Black Mirror’s Bandersnatch? I’m so totally 🤯... what a genius idea 😳 Robin and I spent too long going through all the “pathways” 🙈 • 🙌 #recipe link in profile!
user_33;user_33126.jpg;n e w 🍅 r e c i p e 💃🏻 • Featuring a new homemade #vegan ricotta recipe ✨ Do you have an ingredient you keep buying in the hopes that you’ll use it more often? For me, it’s zucchini. It’s that one ingredient that stays in the fridge to the point of spoiling, and to avoid having to toss it I usually just throw it in a soup 😅 This here recipe was one of those use-up-some-leftover-scraps-in-the-fridge kinda recipe, and yes. Just yes 🤤. The genius who came up with the idea to make these little lasagna-like rolls: none other than our PUL miss Suzy, so compliments to the chef 👩🏻‍🍳 It’s a delish and healthy little appetizer or snack, to enjoy cold or (preferably) hot 🔥 • 🙌 #recipe link in profile!
user_33;user_33127.jpg;Happy New Year’s Eve, friends!! 🎉💃🏻 here in the Netherlands fireworks are banned year round, but the ban is lifted on New Year’s Eve. Kids flood the streets and alleyways and set light to their little rockets 🧨 it’s festive and fun, but it also scares the living daylights outta me. Bangs as loud as gunshots! Haha, I’m clearly getting old 😂 We also have a friend who nearly lost a finger to it a few years back while taking part in it himself 😬 be safe tonight kiddos!! Are fireworks legal to use where you live? Hope you have a magical evening, and wishing you all the loveliest of all starts to the new year ✨ • Ooooh and should you wake up and want some comfort food after a night of festivities, but still want to start the new year right with a wholesome breakfast, may I suggest this pancake recipe? Link in profile 🍒 we’ve been having this for breakfast each morning for the last week 🤤
user_33;user_33128.jpg;Hello from Belgium, and Merry Christmas to all who celebrate! 🎄🎁 Robin and I took a little road trip across the border today to explore the quaint little city of Gent and to check out a super cozy Christmas market. Christmas lights, music, church bells, mulled cider and Belgian waffles everywhere! 😜 Tomorrow, for second Christmas Day (yupp - they celebrate two Christmas days in the Netherlands!), we get together with all of Robin’s family. Wishing you all a merry, festive, relaxing, food-so-good-it’s-coma-inducing holiday season with friends and family ✨
user_33;user_33129.jpg;NEW VIDEO 🎉 second one this week! Whoop whoop 🙌 • I find there’s little more comforting than big ol’ bowl of soup in the fall and winter months. Anyone else agree 🙋🏻‍♀️ • But yours truly used to not care for soups once upon a time. I used think they were bland and unappetizing 😝 until my friend shared some her soup with me that she ordered at a mum&pop restaurant. My mind was 🤯, sooooo good! Ever since I’ve been dedicated to making super wholesome, hearty, and crazy delicious soups 💃🏻 • 👉 #video link in profile 🍅 • What’s you’re favorite comfort food? We’re thinking of making a “vegan classic comfort foods” recipe video sometime in the new year 🤤 all requests/ideas welcome!

We went to Canada, saw family... and a few days in, about 10 family members got seriously ill with some kind of virus, which got Robin and I as well (we were all bed-ridden for days) 🙊 Then we flew back to the Netherlands and started preparations for the PUL studio grand opening party which we coupled with celebrating Mr. Robin’s birthday for close friends and family🎈In the days before, Suzy and I were whipping together food platters, meals and drinks to cater to dozens of people 🥂 it was good food, good fun, and we had a wonderful DJ-in-the-making play us some tunes (see Insta stories)🕺🏻🎶 • All the while we’ve been working on our up-coming videos, and we have some new recipes heading your way soon too 💪 it’s been a full-out sprint, and I’m excited to share the new content with you all in the coming days 💃🏻 anyone else feeling ready for the calm of the holidays to kick in? 😌 • 👉 #video link in profile 🍒
user_33;user_33131.jpg;HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most amazing person I know 🎉🎁🎈🎂 my Mr. Robin 💗 • In reality it was his birthday 4 days ago 🙈 but we both decided to power off for a few days, travel to Canada, and soak up some family time and explore some of Canada’s great outdoors 🌲 • I love that we adventure together, celebrate milestones together, work through hardships together, and build a trusting and nurturing foundation together. Lately, one of my favourite words in Dutch has been “samen” which means “together”. I say it to him all the time. He’s my home and my adventure all at once. He adds to my happiness and grounds me in a way no one else can. He’s not just my life partner, he’s my best friend. And boy oh boy did I get lucky with this one 🤩
user_33;user_33132.jpg;NEW #video 🌞 grab your comforting cup of tea and let’s chat ☕️ the video is about happiness. Complex topic to explore, eh?

The simple things: my brekky oatmeal, cup of tea, and a bike ride to the studio each morning (swipe right) 🚲🌳 unfiltered nature in all its beauty. Isn’t she gorgeous? When the rays shine through the trees like that I seriously just melt... both figuratively and literally because it’s been darn cold here lately 😜 what makes you happy? Oh, and video link in profile 📽
user_33;user_33133.jpg;Oh, hey there. Just wanted to say I love you guys. It’s strange to try to express your gratitude to people you’ve never met, but your consistent support, kind words, and recipe tags seriously feed fuel to my fire. I’m so so so grateful to be part of a community of such incredibly warm and compassionate souls. We have the most lovely little family on the internet. Thanks for the 200k - so heartwarming to see our family continue to grow. With lots and lots and lots of love 💗 S
user_33;user_33134.jpg;Today I was cleaning out some old hard drives and found a document with a bucket list I wrote back in 1st year uni. Oooooh boy, I can’t believe I wanted to bungee jump. Haha nooooo thank you 😬 • And then I told Robin that and you know what he says? He’s been both skydiving and bungee jumping (which I already knew), but get this... he did them BOTH on the same day 😧 WHAA!? What an adrenaline junkee!! Who does both of those things on the same day!?!? 🙊 The kid is crazy, I tell ya. But he makes a mean stir fry so I’ll tolerate the crazy from time to time 😜 • What’s something on your bucket list? ✅ • Recipe link for the stir fry in profile 🤤

The mix-and-swirl or the strategic bites? Because Robin does one and I do the other... and I think he’s crazy for doing it his way 🤪 can you guess what mine is before watching the video? 🤓 • 📽 #video link in profile 💃🏻

user_33;user_33144.jpg;Think back to 2 years ago. Did you think you’d be where you are now? What things are you proud of? What experiences have you learned from? Two years ago today I moved to the Netherlands 🇳🇱 I had sold or given away all of my possessions, fitting everything I had left into one luggage bag. With that bag and a road bike, I said goodbye to all my family and friends and got on the plane with a one-way ticket... en route to live in a country outside of Canada for the first time in my life 🇨🇦✈️ So much has happened in these last 2 years: things I had hoped and planned for, things I could have never imagined, things that made me squeal with excitement, and times that felt so rough I’m proud to have powered through. I’ve missed my family intensely, but I’m grateful for the family I’ve created here and online (yes, you 🤗). I’ve missed the comforts of home, but it nourishes my soul to explore new places. The language barrier makes life difficult sometimes, but everyday I’m learning a little bit more of this peculiar language 🤓 It’s not easy uprooting your life to a new country, but I wouldn’t change it for a thing. I love calling both the Netherlands and Canada home 🏡💗 ... but I do wonder where we’ll be 2 years from now 😏

NEW RECIPE for these indulgent brownies with coconut whip now on the blog 🌴🥥 link in profile 💃🏻 Also, I have a thing with chocolate 🙈 If desserts don’t have chocolate they’re usually good... but I tend to always feel they‘d be even better with chocolate added in, sprinkled on, or drizzled over top 🤪. Anyone agree? Buuuut I know: I need to expand my horizons a bit. So help me out: what dessert should we make next that’s chocolate-free? 🧐
user_33;user_33148.jpg;NEW VIDEO now on the tube 💃🏻 link in profile 🍒  I was first introduced to the #vegan lifestyle by my cousin, but I had zero interest in following it myself. Months later documentaries inspired me to go vegetarian and to try veganism for a while, but it didn’t last long. Wanna know what did it in the end for me? A TV show about zombies called The Walking Dead. Weird, I know 🙈 I share more about it on our “about” page on the blog 😅  But what about you? If you’ve adopted even a little bit more of a plant-based lifestyle, what was your inspiration? Was it a person, documentary, movie? 🕺🏻📽🍿 see you in the comments! 🌱
user_33;user_33149.jpg;Found this sunflower field along the side of a bike path not far from the studio 🌻🌻🌻 oh it makes me so happy 😇 And slowly, slowly things are coming together at the new PUL #headquarters. We finally have internet now (apparently that can take a super long time to establish in a newly-built building 🙈) and our fridge just arrived today too! 💃🏻 Now we can start doing some grocery shopping for new recipe creations! 👩🏻‍🌾 The only other major item we’re waiting for are acoustic panels so the echo goes away, and then we can finally start filming in the studio too 😆 oh the thought makes me so happy I could cry 😭 sometimes I feel like it’s all going sooooooo slowly, but I also look back each week and see how much we’ve accomplished... and how much we’ve learned throughout this whole process! Slow and steady, friends. #slowandsteady 😉 Happy Friday! 🌻

user_33;user_33151.jpg;Have you ever felt confused with all the conflicting nutrition information out there❓ 🍎 some sources saying fruits are the healthiest thing we can eat, other sources saying they’re too high in sugar and should be avoided 🥨 some say grains are good, but some say grains are bad... same goes for oils 🌽 GMOs are good... no wait, are those bad too? 🤔 even I get overwhelmed sometimes 🤷🏻‍♀️ 📽 we just put up a #newvideo about creating a mindset for healthy eating, amidst all this confusion 🍍🍟 hope you find it helpful! link in profile 😇

user_33;user_33157.jpg;"1 million. Our little (not-so-little anymore) family grew to #1million early yesterday. I don’t even know how to wrap my head around a number like that. I remember taking this photo before I launched the PUL site and was wondering, “could it be possible to reach 100,000 in one year?” And 1.5 years later we grew to 10x that amount. All thanks to YOU. Never in a million years would I have thought this would happen 🌱  Any milestone marks a moment for reflection and looking back, if I can be honest, deciding to take this path wasn’t an easy one. There have been plenty and plenty of beautiful and magical moments, but some difficult times too. The uncertainty of having left a stable job to pursue this new path; the pressure that comes with starting any new business, and in a new country at that; the insecurities that can come with having thousands of people critiquing your work... I could go on. There were so many moments where I wondered if I was doing the right thing, and if it might be easier if I just quit. But looking back, I wouldn’t trade the journey for anything. Reading your inspiring comments and emails are the highlight of my day. When I get to bump into some of you on the street, I feel like I’ve just met a long lost pen pal. The ups and downs of the journey have made me even more grateful for my friends and family who have been there for me through it all 🙏  Seriously, Robin, thank you for everything. For being my advisor, my support, my crutch, my camera man, even after just coming home from a full day at work. Thanks for giving up your weekends to help me brainstorm video ideas and thanks for saying my recipes tasted good when we both knew that test run went horribly wrong 😜  And now that I feel like I’m giving a speech at the oscars I feel awkward and cheesy, but i don’t mind it. It’s how I genuinely feel 💃🏻 A big hug and kiss to all of you. Thanks for making this little Canadian gal one very lucky lady. Not just because of the 1 mill, but because you’ve stuck around from the beginning. Because you shared the dream for nourishing the cells and the soul. Love you all so so so much 💗  Photo cred: the ultra talented @mehdinowroozi"

user_33;user_33170.jpg;"It’s been a whirlwind of a few weeks, and I don’t think it’s going to slow down anytime soon 🙈 #helloadultlife 🙋🏻‍♀️ • To list a few: getting things in order for the new studio 🏠; reading through the hundreds of amazing intern applications (so many more applications than we anticipated, wow! thank you to everyone who applied! 🤗🙏); creating new content for PUL 👩🏻‍🌾; finishing up taxes in a new country for the first time (hahaha oh man, as if taxes weren’t already tricky enough 😅); working to get my Dutch driving license + learning to drive standard (can’t transfer over my Canadian license + I drove automatic 🚙); and getting ready to visit family back in Vancouver later this week 🇨🇦! Feeling like I’ve fallen far behind on learning/practicing Dutch, but hey... there’s only so much a girl can do 🤷🏻‍♀️😜🤓 • Three things have helped me manage it all: (1) Robin, my support person and go-to source for all things Dutch 💗 (2) making time to get active, get outside and into nature - clears my mind and helps with making better decisions 🌳🚲, (3) having something to look forward to... in this case it’s been watching and re-watching videos of my nephew (see IG stories 👶🏻).

user_33;user_33199.jpg;Every couple weeks I’m just going about my business, biking or strolling through the city, when the following thought creeps into my head: how the heck did a Canadian girl end up living in this foreign country? 🤔 Over one year later and I’m still taken aback by that thought each time. Sometimes you never know where life takes you and why. That’s the beauty in it though. Sometimes it’s for the worse and sometimes for the better, but it always happens for a reason. Or at least I’m one of the hippies that thinks so 😅 don’t you? #cheesywordsoftheday 💕
