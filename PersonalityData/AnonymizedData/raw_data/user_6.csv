user_6;user_627.jpg;My bb 🥺 your heart is so big & mom & dad love you so much. When jitsu was rescued in October of 2018 he was found with a broken leg, matted, abandoned, living on the streets. His rescue got him through surgery to try to fix is leg in January 2019. We adopted him in June 2019 and fell in love. We noticed right away that on top of just being the most cuddly loving pup, he loves being active despite showing tenderness and complication in his left leg... he LOVES walks especially. Unfortunately even with diet changes, giving him the best quality food, pet CBD, medications, supplements, we began to think that likely his leg wouldn’t ever properly heal & he would always have a limp. Things began to become worrisome when about once a month he would have an episode of leg pain and at then end of February he had the worst flare up yet, he was scream crying through the night and our hearts were broken. A trip to the vet the next day with X-rays showed that the surgery he had received has failed him, causing a potential infection and causing deterioration in the bone. Hence, his monthly episodes of pain. With the consultation of two separate vets, we have made the decision to amputate his leg (as trying to keep it or fix it again would likely not be successful and cause him more pain /problems.) His surgery is In a few days. All we want for jitsu is for him to be pain free and give him the best possible life. It’s it’s been so hard to imagine this major change, lots of tears have been shed 🥺 but we know this is what is best for him in the long run. We would do anything for this little angle. Thankfully it’s said that 3 (even 2) legged dogs thrive too 🙏🏼 He has gotten me through my darkest times. I owe so much to him. He has taken care of me just as much as I take care of him. So all we hope for is a quick recovery and for our boy to be the happiest he’s ever been, free from any pain.  One last thing I have to say ...we are going to miss his infamous crossed leg pose 😫 swipe above to see the pose he pulls every time he’s in the kitchen as he watches me cook ❤️ • • • #adoptdontshop #adopt #rescuedogsofinstagram #rescuedog #rescue #rescuedogs #adoptdontshop

Allow to sit for about 5 minutes. 2. Add melted vegan butter and salt. Add flour a cup at a time until you’ve added 3-1/3 cups and mix until well combined. Dough will be really sticky but keep mixing / needing with your hands. If way too sticky add 1/4 cup more of flour. Keep kneading with your hands for about 4-5 minutes. 3.

user_6;user_643.jpg;A quick pause on recipes❣️ A little family quarantine photo to share a few things that I think is important during this time 🙏🏼 1. COMPASSION! Having compassion for everyone and remembering we are all going through this differently is so important. It’s not our place to judge but our place to come together and hold compassion for our neighbors, family, friends and community. Be safe, be considerate and be selfless.  2. Support the small businesses in your community! Restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, yoga studios, spin studios (gyms in general), local shops, farmers market vendors. Support them by buying gift cards, ordering take out and seeing if they’re are doing online orders right now! We want these businesses to be supported to be able to get through this time. 3. Reach out to your local animal shelters and dog rescues. Many are REALLY in need of fosters (also always doggos who are a waiting adoption). If you need a quarantine buddy, this is your time to save or help a pups life ! 4. Major love and endless appreciation to all the medical professionals, first responders, hard working people who are still ordered to go to work🙏🏼 5. I will be tagging all the SD small businesses & people to support during this time and feel free to leave a comment below on any businesses you want to shout out that need support as well! 6. Lastly, as we all are cooped up at home, I’m seeing 👀 so many more of you cooking up a storm in the kitchen ❤️ I am always here to help out with recipe questions and can always take requests on what recipes to create next based on the ingredients you have in your fridge!

user_6;user_645.jpg;STICKY SESAME CAULIFLOWER WINGS!Swipe! CAULI VS TOFU! Which would you choose 🤔 The sauce comes from my sticky sesame tofu recipe... decided to switch it up today. This sauce is so versatile (and ingredients you hopefully already have in your fridge 🙏🏼) it would be amazing with a veggie stir fry (like with eggplant, mushrooms, even noodles) RECIPE: Cauliflower wings: 1 head of cauliflower, cut into florets 1 1/2 Cup unsweetened almond milk 1 Cup brown rice flour (or regular all purpose flour) 1/4 tsp sea salt 1/4 tsp ground pepper  Sesame sticky Sauce: 1 teaspoon avocado oil 2 garlic cloves minced 2 tbsp organic brown sugar or coconut sugar 2 tsp rice vinegar 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp Tamari or soy sauce 1/4 cup organic ketchup 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 2 tbsp sesame seeds Other ingredients: sliced green onions for garnish White or brown rice to serve INSTRUCTIONS 1.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and line baking sheet with parchment paper. 2.Next, prepare batter. Mix dry ingredients together, and then add almond milk. Stir with a whisk or fork until well combined. You want the batter thick but pourable so it can stick to the cauliflower… if it is too runny, it won’t stick. 3.Once the oven is preheated, add cauliflower one at a time to the batter to coat. Shake off excess and place on baking sheet. Easiest done with a fork! Give each piece 1 inch of room. Bake for 30 minutes. 3. In a bowl combine all sauce ingredients (except garlic & avo oil) mix to combine. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the sauce mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until just thickened. 4. Add the cauliflower wings to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle with sesame more seeds and green onions, then serve with rice! • • #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #veganaf #vegancheese #f52grams #feedfeed #yum #plantbased #plant #veg #cauli

Roast until golden and soft, about 40 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, cook pasta noodles according to directions on package. 4. Once the pasta is done cooking, drain then return pasta to pot. 5.

user_6;user_667.jpg;"EASY VEGAN PAD THAI! (Want to see a “how to” video on my stories? Let me know below in the comments!) TAG your people below in the comments! Recipe is very easy, I just explain everything thoroughly for you guys!  RECIPE serves 2-4 Ingredients: 7-8 ounces rice noodles 2 tablespoons avocado oil or vegetable oil 4 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 container firm tofu 4 green onions, cut into 2-inch strips 1 cup bean sprouts 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, chopped Sauce: 4 tbsp soy sauce (or Tamari for GF) 4 tbsp cane sugar sugar 1 tbsp lime juice 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tbsp Sriracha 2 tbsp pure tamarind paste OR (you can make your own… I did! 6 sweet tamarind pods + 1 cup hot water: in this case use 4 tbsp of the homemade tamarind paste) Notes: -Tamarind paste is sometimes difficult to find thats why I like making my own! It is easy to make too! *DON’T skip the tamarind paste. Its the primary flavor in pad Thai! -You could find tamarind pods in an Asian grocery store and sometimes even regular grocery stores too! -If you buy the rice noodles in an asian market buy the “rice sticks; pho noodles” or at a regular grocery store they are typically just called either Pad Thai noodles or rice noodles. Method: 1.If you have chosen to make your own tamarind paste, take off the shell of 6 tamarind pods then place in a bowl with 1 cup of hot water. Let sit for 5 minutes then using a large fork break down the tamarind, smashing it and mixing…it should create a lumpy sauce, Mix until it becomes a bit smoother 2.Next grab a bowl & spoon out 2 tbsp of tamarind sauce into the bowl (make sure to not get any seeds or big lumps) if using store bought tamarind paste use 2 tbsp, then add cane sugar, lime juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce and Sriracha and minced garlic. Whisk together until smooth and set aside. 3.Prepare the rice noodles according to the directions on package. *The rice noodles I used required for 6-8 minutes of soaking in hot water. * Its okay that the noodles feel a bit firm. Noodles continue to cook in the pan with the sauce. (Recipe continued in comments) #padthai #foodie #food #vegan #f52grams #feedfeed #recipes #health #vegetarian #glutenfree #yum #eat"

I’m obsessed. I put it in EVERYTHING, even my tofu scramble 😂 I think my israelis would be proud though because creamy tahini sauce (which btw in Israel is just called tahini... and it’s pure form is tahini paste) seemed to be involved in nearly all of our meals & I was always more then ok with it 😍 swipe & try not to drool ^  RECIPE Ingredients: Rustic bread Shiitake mushrooms Thyme, chopped 2 tbsp avocado oil 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp ground pepper 2-3 cloves garlic, minced Tahini sauce 1 cup tahini 1/2 cup cold water (or more depending on what consistency you want) Juice of 2 lemons 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp salt 1/4 tsp ground pepper + any other spices you want like paprika!  NSTRUCTIONS: 1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Add mushrooms, minced garlic, chopped thyme, 2-3 tbsp oil, and 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch of cracked pepper on a rimmed baking sheet and toss making sure mushrooms are well seasoned. Bake in oven, tossing halfway through, until deeply golden brown and crisped, about 25 minutes. 2. In a bowl add 1 cup tahini and half the amount of cold water. Mix then add the remaining water, lemon juice mix until smooth and creamy. Add more water if needed! Add the salt, pepper and garlic powder. Mix again. * you can store it in a jar in your fridge for up to a couple weeks! Enjoy on rice bowls, veggies and of course on toast 😍 3. Once your mushrooms are done, and tahini sauce is ready, toast bread and spread tahini sauce then top off with mushrooms and flakey salt! • • •  #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #veganaf #vegancheese #f52grams #feedfeed #baking #bake #yum #plantbased #plant #veg

Then add spinach, soy sauce, sesame seeds, salt, mix and cook for 3 minutes or until spinach is completely cooked and wilted. Turn off heat. Taste and add more salt if needed. Turn off heat, transfer mixture to a bowl or plate and let cool. 2. Heat oil to 375. Lay out one egg roll wrapper with a corner pointed toward you. Place 2 tablespoons of mixture in the center. 3. Fold two of the corners together to make a triangle, fold the sides in and then roll tightly. Like you would wrap a burrito! Seal the last corner edge by Dipping your finger into water then dabbing it onto the corner. 4. Fry egg rolls until lightly browned and crispy turning occasionally.

user_6;user_689.jpg;CRISPY AF CAULI WINGS with VEGAN “honey” MUSTARD SAUCE✨ Tag a friend and grab full recipe below! Ingredients: 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1 cup + 2 tbsp brown rice flour 1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk 1 tsp paprika (divided) 1 tsp salt (divided) 1 tsp garlic powder (divided) Maple mustard sauce: 2 tbsp vegan honey (I used the bee free honey, honey made from apples or you can use 100% maple syrup) 1/4 cup vegan mayo 1/4 cup dijon mustard 1/4 cup yellow mustard 1/4 tsp paprika 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar INSTRUCTIONS 1.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 2.In a bowl combine panko bread crumbs with 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp paprika powder. Mix then set aside. 3..Next, prepare batter. Mix brown rice flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp garlic powder and then add almond milk. Stir with a whisk or fork until well combined. You want the batter thick but pourable so it can stick to the cauliflower… if it is too runny, it won’t stick. 4..Once the oven is preheated, add cauliflower one at a time to the batter to coat. Shake off excess then roll into the panko bread crumbs and place on baking sheet. Easiest done with a fork! Give each piece 1 inch of room. 5.Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown. 6.Meanwhile prepare the “honey” mustard sauce. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a bowl and whisk together until smooth! 7.Enjoy right out of the oven :) • • • #veganfood #veganfoodshare #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #veganaf #cauliwings #cauliflowerwings #f52grams

user_6;user_6104.jpg;Hi 🤓 it’s me. I recently caught a little cold 😫 (any one else!?) BUT I have to say I fought it pretty quickly.. here’s how: For starters, I’m obv one to indulge in YUMMY PLANT DECADENT FOOD, but believe it or not I also eat clean and take care of myself with lots of nourishment... it’s called BALANCE... hehe. HERE ARE MY TIPS: I Drink lots of water, take probiotic vitamin daily (along with my other supplements) & lately for breakfast I have been having local coconut milk yogurt filled with probiotics topped with seasonal fruit, a sweet little chewy touch from @madeinnature organic dried mangoes, dash of cinnamon and a few cashews all with a side of ginger tea. Eating seasonally, hydrating, rest,nourishing the body with plants are all so important and key to bouncing back quickly. • • •  #madeinnature #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #veganaf #vegancheese #f52grams #feedfeed #baking #bake #yum #plantbased #plant #veg

Pick out any stones or weird looking chickpeas and Drain well. 3.Pressure Cook Chickpeas if you have a pressure cooker! If not you could cook them on the stove: add the soaked, drained and rinsed beans to a large pot. Cover with several inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until they reach your desired tenderness, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 4.For pressure cooker add the soaked chickpeas,1 whole garlic (break apart cloves and peel each), roughly chopped onion & 1 1/2 tsp salt in pressure cooker. 5.Pour in 5 cups water, then give it a quick mix.  Close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position.  Put on High Pressure 20 minutes then natural Release 20 minutes. Open the lid carefully. 6.Once the chickpeas are cooked, add to a high speed blender or food processor (include the onion and garlic), tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, paprika, cumin, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Blend until super smooth. If you think it needs a bit of moisture you can add the juice from the beans. About 1/4 cup would be good! 7.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed and serve with fluffy homemade pita (recipe coming soon), crackers, veggies or spread on a sandwich! 3rd photo by @amir_menahem_ ✨ • #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #hummus
user_6;user_6107.jpg;CRISPY SMASHED THYME POTATOES with VEGAN RANCH! SO FRIKN GOOD. TAG your ppl and make these like NOW! (“How to” on stories also swipe to hear chancys reaction 😂) RECIPE Ingredients: 1.5 lb Mini Dutch yellow potatoes About 4-6 tbsp avocado oil 8 sprigs fresh thyme Salt & pepper Vegan Ranch dressing: 1 cup raw cashews 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp filtered water 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh cilantro or parsley 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh Chives 2 tbsp fresh dill 1/2 tsp paprika 1 tsp garlic powder 1/4 cup unsweetened, plain almond milk 1 tbsp rice or white vinegar 1 tsp Salt 1/4 tsp Pepper  1. In a large pot of boiling water, cook potatoes until tender, about 15-20 minutes then drain. 2. While your potatoes are boiling, prepare ranch dressing, Soak raw cashews in hot water for 15 minutes. Then drain raw cashews and place in a blender with 1/2 cup. Blend until smooth. Scoop the cashew cream into a bowl and add all the remaining ranch dressing ingredients, mix to combine, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. 3. Bring a large non stick skillet to medium high heat. Add about 4 tbsp avocado oil, the entire pan should be evenly coated with oil. Once oil is hot, reduce heat to medium then Add potatoes to skillet (dont over crowd the pan... you could do this in batches) and cook until bottom side is golden brown, flip potatoes and cook until other side is golden brown. Should take 2-4 minutes on both sides. With the back of a spatula or glass cup carefully smash the potatoes until flattened but still in one piece. But... It’s ok if some semi fall apart! 4. Season generously with salt, pepper then add sprigs of thyme. Let the thyme get a little fried in the oil ! It’s so tasty. Let the potatoes and thyme get nice and crispy cooking for 6-10 minutes on medium to low heat. If you find you’re not getting a good enough crisp add a touch more oil to the pan. 5. Serve hot with vegan ranch dressing, and a sprinkle of flakey sea salt! • • •  #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #f52grams #feedfeed #plantbased

It feels like yesterday you were turning 19, and I was making you pancakes (illegally? 🥴) on the floor of my college dorm bedroom with a hot plate stove 😂* I really tried to chef it up even back in my college days. Lol. We fell in love when we were practically kids, teens entering “adulthood”, figuring out what makes us passionate & happy, each changed our minds on what career we wanted to chase after, had our differences & our low times... that’s life & relationships are work. (like why didn’t anyone ever tell us this?! 😂🥴). No but, it’s the truth and I’m not ashamed to say it :) With this all said, I can’t express enough how beautiful it is to grow together. To challenge one another, to hold acceptance & not judgment, to push one another, to support each other, to encourage one another to do what makes them happy and to be independent strong individuals, to hold on to our individuality, to have forgiveness... & to have the upmost respect for one another. @chancy.james thank you for always reminding me to genuinely love and appreciate even the smallest things in life.

Make sure you have two large baking sheets lined with parchment paper ready… as well as a blender. 2. Cut your squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds & carefully cut skin off . * If you are using kabocha squash you can keep the skin on. Cut into chunks then place on baking sheet.

Sauté for 5 minutes then add veggie broth.  Bring to a simmer.

user_6;user_6124.jpg;"VEGAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP! SO Easy, tasty as heck & just a bowl of pure comfort food -RECIPE-  Ingredients: 16 ounces sliced crimini mushrooms 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms 1 small yellow onion, finely diced 3 garlic cloves, minced 3 tbsp avocado oil (divided) 8-10 fresh thyme sprigs, finely chopped 4 cups veggie broth (or 5 cups filtered water + 1 tbsp vegan bouillon paste) 1 cup raw cashews (soaked in hot water for Atleast 10 minutes) + 1 1/2 cups filtered water; this is going to make your cashew milk. * if you need an alternative 1 1/2 cups of full fat coconut milk FROM A CAN will work too :) Rustic bread  Instructions: 1. Heat 2 tbsp avocado oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion & sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until softened then add garlic & cook for 2 minutes. 2. Add mushrooms and 2 tsp chopped thyme, cook for 7 minutes. 3. Add veggie broth (or water + 1 tbsp bouillon paste) mix again and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low-medium heat, season with salt, pepper. 4. Cover and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, while occasionally stirring. 5. Meanwhile in a high speed blender combine 1 cup soaked cashews & 1 1/2 filtered water. Blend on high for 1 minute. 6. Reduce heat to low, then pour cashew milk straight from blender to soup (no straining needed) stir in cashew milk. Allow to gently simmer for 5-7 minutes on low heat. 7. This part is optional... you can keep the soup as is... or blend half the amount of soup in a blender by carefully ladling the soup into your blender and blending intil smooth then pouring back into the pot. I like the bit of creaminess and thickness it gives to the soup while still having the slices of mushroom in there too ! 8. Lastly (also optional) bring a pan to medium heat, add 1 tbsp avocado oil and add whole shiitake & or oyster mushrooms. frequently tossing them around. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes or until golden. 9. To serve, top soup off with sautéed whole mushrooms, sprinkle of thyme & a side of rustic toasted bread. • #mushroom #soup #vegan #bestofvegan #f52grams #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #dairyfree #vegetarian"

user_6;user_6126.jpg;Happy Sunday loves ✨ Picnic with veg, hummus, (Vegan) Spanish tortilla & @harmlessharvest for hydration ❣️ @harmlessharvest is for humans & dogs that think they’re humans too 🙊🥴🙃 aka Jitsu. Do we spoil him, yes... does he deserve it... yes 😂 On a serious note, adopting Jitsu 6 months ago was the best decision @chancy.james and I made. Long story short, he lived many years on the streets of Mexico with a broken leg, matted, dirty & in need for some LOVIN. It took some time for him to be adopted post rescue because he’s an older dog (the vet thinks he’s 8 years old) & I think ppl may think taking care of a dog with not all 4 working legs is difficult (it’s actually not really at all). Anyways, hold on to your thousands of dollars & “want” to BUY dogs. I know designer puppies are so precious but you can find nearly EVERY breed of dog in rescues! Puppies toooooo! Rescue dogs are often the most LOVING and truly appreciative for the safe, loving, caring home you give them. If you ever have any questions regarding doggie adoption let me know ❣️ • • • • #veganfood #ad #harmlesscoconutwater #harmlessharvest #coconut #cocowater #coconutwater #hydrate #health #healthy #plants #plantfood #plantbased #veganism #animals #crueltyfree #adopt #adoptdontshop #adoption #adoptdontshop🐾 #adopt #dog #dogsofinstagram #vegan #doggie #dogoftheday #dogs #love Beyond appreciative for the rescuer, rescue organization & fosters who loved jitsu before he became ours ✨  @patitasdelacalle_ng @thebarkinglotrescue @nena_guzman @who_rescued_whom

user_6;user_6128.jpg;HOMEMADE FLOUR TORTILLAS! Easy peasy recipe. Tag your ppl and grab recipe below! PS... try adding a bit of (vegan) butter to your warm flour tortilla... thank me later. Ok bye. RECIPE Ingredients: 3 cups all purpose flour 6 tablespoons oil (I use avocado but any oil is fine) 1 cup warm water 2 heaping tsp salt Method 1. Put your flour in a bowl and add salt. Mix a bit. Add oil. With a fork mix it in until it looks like wet sand. Heat water. Add ONLY 3/4 cup. Then mix with a fork in the beginning. Then use your hand to bring the dough together. If you feel you need a bit more water use a little from what you have left. Once it’s in a nice ball, wrap in Saran Wrap. Place it in a bowl and put a towel on top. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes. After that time the dough will be ready to roll out. I usually get around 12 balls for small tortillas or 8 for large! 2. Heat your comal. When you place the tortilla on it , let it cook a bit then flip. You don’t want them too brown too much. Place them in the towel you used on top of bowl. The towels keeps them moist and tender. When your done you can store them in a zip bag. Thank you @thrboys for the recipe 😘

user_6;user_6144.jpg;HOMEMADE VEGAN FLAT BREAD✨ (“How to” video In my highlight ig stories) Fluffy, SO soft, slightly chewy 😍 who wants one ? Easy, no stand mixer (Although if you have one use it!) , oven, or bread machine needed, just your hands 🖐! Tag a friend who would make this with you OR for you 😌❤️ Ingredients: 3 1/3 (+ 1/4 cup more if needed) cups all purpose flour or bread flour 1-1/2 cups + 2 tbsp warm unsweetened almond milk  2 tablespoons sugar (I used cane sugar or coconut sugar) 1 package active dry yeast 2 tablespoons vegan butter, melted 1/2 tsp teaspoons salt Avocado oil or olive oil Method: 1. Heat almond milk in microwave for 45 seconds or until warm.  In the bowl combine warm almond milk and sugar, mix to combine then sprinkle yeast over the top of the almond milk. Allow to sit for about 5 minutes. 2. Add melted vegan butter and salt. Add flour a cup at a time until you’ve added 3-1/3 cups and mix until well combined. Dough will be really sticky but keep mixing / needing with your hands. If way too sticky add 1/4 cup more of flour. Keep kneading with your hands for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been coated with cooking spray or olive oil. Place a dish cloth over the bowl and allow bowl to sit on your counter for an hour or until doubled in size. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into circles. 4. Heat a pan to medium heat. Brush the top of each dough circle with a small bit of avocado oil (or olive oil) and place the flat bread oil side down onto the grill. When the bottom side is browned, turn over the bread, and grill the other side until golden. Remove from heat, brush a bit more of oil on top and sprinkle with salt. Enjoy with hummus, as a wrap or how ever you wish! . . . . . . #veganfood #veganfoodshare #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian #veganaf #bread #gluten #foodie #vegan

Method:  1. In a large pot over medium to high heat melt coconut oil then add diced onion, minced garlic and minced ginger. Sauté all together for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper for 5-6 minutes then add chopped bell peppers, tofu, broccolini & sauté for 7 minutes, stirring as it cooks.  Add vegetable broth, coconut milk, soy sauce, curry paste, maple syrup and stir. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or until vegetable are tender. 2.

They get really crisp this way…BUT I noticed once i added it to the curry it softened and was no longer crispy… So just keep that In mind! :) Good eaten separately otherwise just follow directions above! . . . . #veganfood #veganfoodshare #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #crueltyfree #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #veglife #plantbased #plantbaseddiet #foodporn #comfortfood #dairyfree #vegetarian

user_6;user_6150.jpg;"VEGAN PAD THAI ✨ TAG A FRIEND AND GRAB RECIPE! Recipe is very easy, I just explain everything thoroughly for you guys!  Recipe serves 2-3 Ingredients: 7-8 ounces rice noodles 2 tablespoons avocado oil or vegetable oil 4 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 container baked tofu or firm tofu 4 green onions, cut into 2-inch strips 1 cup bean sprouts 1/4 cup dry-roasted peanuts, chopped Sauce: 4 tablespoons soy sauce 4 tablespoons cane sugar sugar 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 tablespoon Sriracha 2 tbsp pure tamarind paste OR (you can make your own… I did! 6 sweet tamarind pods + 1 cup hot water: in this case use 4 tbsp of the homemade tamarind paste) Notes: -Tamarind paste is sometimes difficult to find thats why I like making my own! It is easy to make too! *DON’T skip the tamarind paste. Its the primary flavor in pad Thai! -You could find tamarind pods in an Asian grocery store and sometimes even regular grocery stores too! -If you buy the rice noodles in an asian market buy the “rice sticks; pho noodles” or at a regular grocery store they are typically just called either Pad Thai noodles or rice noodles. Method: 1.If you have chosen to make your own tamarind paste, take off the shell of 6 tamarind pods then place in a bowl with 1 cup of hot water. Let sit for 5 minutes then using a large fork break down the tamarind, smashing it and mixing…it should create a lumpy sauce, Mix until it becomes a bit smoother…you will see the seeds & a bit of lumpiness. 2.Next grab a medium bowl and spoon out 2 tbsp of tamarind sauce into the bowl (make sure to not get any seeds or big lumps) if using store bought tamarind paste use 2 tbsp, then add cane sugar, lime juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce and Sriracha and minced garlic. Whisk together until smooth and set aside. 3.Prepare the rice noodles according to the directions on package. *The rice noodles I purchased at the asian market required for 6-8 minutes of soaking in hot water. * Its okay that the noodles feel a bit firm (al dente!). Noodles continue to cook in the pan with the sauce. (Recipe cont in comments. ✨) #veganfood #veganfoodporn #padthai #f52grams #vegan #food #veganfoodporn #veganfoodie #vegan"

I want my hair to thrive in its natural way but I also like to feel confident so rn its having black hair and having my grays covered up! @suryabrasilbeauty Henna cream (I use color black... there's 16 different colors) has been a game changer for my hair... covers my gray hairs, no harsh chemicals (doesn't contain ammomia and ammonia.. And by product of ammonia like diethalonamine, triethalonamina and ethalonamine) my hair is being exposed to and the results are really bomb!  @suryabrasilbeauty Henna Cream is available in @sprouts markets! • • #suryabrasil #americanoize  #suryabrasilvegan #vegancosmetic #colorhair #hair #hennacream #vegan #home #crystals #crueltyfree #clean #veganbeauty #cleanbeauty #cf #cleaningredients #veg

user_6;user_6167.jpg;I didn’t go to culinary school or ever worked endless hours in a restaurant kitchen. (Something I really wanted to do but it just wasn’t in my path) I just was always the kid who watched more food network then Disney channel 😂🥴 i was also the kid who taught “how to make sushi” for a in class presentation. Lol.  I have always had a deep admiration for the chefs I would learn from through my television screen and wished I could be like them one day. This is just me saying hey... Listen to your gut feeling, your intuition, that passion that lies within you. Passions should not be ignored. Work hard, keep your mind open to constantly learning and run with it.

HOW TO ASSEMBLE:  1. Set up your workspace, by laying a large piece of plastic wrap over a clean dry cutting board. Lay a nori sheet on top, with the smooth side facing down. 2. Spread rice onto the center of the dried seaweed (positioned in diamond angle). (Tip: make sure to wet your hands while doing this, from preventing the rice to stick) 3. Add your toppings. Using the plastic wrap, pull one edge of the nori sheet towards the center of the ""diamond"" rice. Press down to allow for the nori to stick to the rice, then peel back the plastic wrap. Repeat for the opposite side and the remaining corners. 4. Keep it in the plastic wrap for a couple of minutes. Gently press down to help the nori stick to the rice and hold its shape.
