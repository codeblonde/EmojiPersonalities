user_0;user_00.jpg;🌿✨ Breakfast Board for one☝🏼🤪🙋🏻‍♀️ Macros: 554kcals 67C 15F 38P ✨ Just goes to show you don’t have to limit yourself 🤣 either that or I have no self control when it comes to breakfast aha ✨ #breakfastboard #brunchboard ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Sometimes I’m just really undecided on what I should have for breakfast 😅 on this particular day, I was definitely split between waffles, pancakes and toast! Instead I just had miniature portions of them all! Breakfast for me, personally, is an experience! So this plate was perfect! If I ever own my own cafe one day, that’s what I’d want to present, an experience ❤️👏🏼 I used my chocolate courgette waffle and pancake recipe from my ebook - but I halved the portion of each to make a smaller batter! I then smashed some avo on toast and sliced some banana with peanut butter spread on another bit of toast! The toast I like to use is the @hovis nimble bread as each slice contains only 50kcals! I also served the mains of the dish with fresh berries, some more peanut butter and chocolate chips! ✨ Also, just to drop a little hint 😂 I’m filming my 10K calorie challenge next week, a mega breakfast board is definitely on the cards 👏🏼👏🏼 What would you have on your breakfast/brunch board? Let me known ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ The link to my breakfast all day ebook is in my bio! It’s £5.99 and contains over 30+ vegan high protein breakfast recipes, including variations, substitutes and macros!

I used my french toast recipe in my ebook, all I did in replace was use a bagel to soak up the mixture and added cacao powder to the batter!! I chopped the bagel up into quarters, allowed to soak in the french toast batter, popped it in the oven for 20 mins to crisp and Viola 👌🏼 ✨ I then of course went wild with the toppings and added a scoop of @breyersdelightsuk chocolate hazelnut ice cream (my current vegan ice cream fave at the moment), some chocolate chips and raspberries! ✨ Today I’m filming my self care routine for youtube ❤️🎥 Waffleswithleila! ✨ Ive dedicated this whole day to sitting back, relaxing and chill time!

user_0;user_09.jpg;"🌿✨ Do you like drinking your calories? 👇🏼👇🏼✨ I get a lot of questions on whether it’s “good” or “bad”! ✨simple answer is, nothing’s good or bad! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨How you choose to consume your calories is completely up to you! When I went through my eating disorder I feared drinking my calories, I didn’t/ couldn’t and wouldn’t have smoothies or milkshakes, soups, milk in my teas or coffee, I never had juices or fizzy drinks!✨ Personally, drinks don’t fill me up, so now I tend to have smoothie bowls as oppose to a smoothie drink more often then not! ✨ I don’t fear drinking calories as oppose to when I did, I just prefer eating solids! ✨ Or if I’m drinking a smoothie because I feel like it, I’d bulk it up with chia/ flax seeds, avocados or oats! ✨ you don’t need to question or justify whether “you can” drink your calories! Of course you can! ✨ I do love myself a milky matcha latte or frothy coffee for sure 👏🏼✨ The only thing I’d say is that it’s easy to drink your calories without even realising and the fact that it doesn’t satisfy your hunger! ✨ I’m definitely not the type to only have a protein shake after a workout ... defo not! It just won’t cut it! ✨ Especially after a workout; carbs, fats and protein all have to be involved - not only to satisfy my hunger but to replenish my muscle fibres and restore my glycogen levels ✨ what’s your opinions let me know ? ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨Sending a big thankyou to @amtcoffee for gifting me vouchers to use at their cafes located at my work place and other hospitals! Love their new vegan chocolate coconut milkshake 🤤👏🏼 it was like one big slushieee! Also shoutout to my colleague for the mini photoshoot we had before work 🤪 #gifted ✨🌿"
user_0;user_010.jpg;🌿✨Banoffee pie stuffed bagel 🤤👏🏼✨ Ive really been on a bagel hype recently! Thiccccc bagels! Thin bagels are fab aswell but that’s more of a snack 🤣 In fact... a bread hype which you may be able to tell on my feed 😅 I mean... bread is sooo fabulous rightttt?!? I even have pitta bread and hummus today as part of my lunch 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ What’s your favourite kind? ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨@nushfoods kindly sent out a little care package to make their banoffee pie recipe, but when I was thinking what to have for breakfast today, I was just feeeeeling the idea of a banoffee stuffed bagel, so we went with it and it turned out fabulous!!✨ I used 30g of @nushfoods cream cheese mixed with some vanilla protein powder, some slices of banana, @naturescharm coconut caramel spread and chopped up pieces of @ombarchocolate 🤤👌🏼 defo hit the spot this morning after a legs session!! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨Let me know your go to bagel stuffing, sweet or savoury!!! ✨ Have a fab friyayheyheyyy peeps ✌🏼#gifted ✨🌿

user_0;user_012.jpg;🌿✨Jammmmy white chocolate bowl of hot comforting oats 🤤👏🏼✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨A hot bowl of oats on a gloomy rainy day, with toppings that bring the bowl to life... so good!! Soo yummy! So fabuloussss! My favourite way to bulk up a bowl of oats and I would say is my go to is grated courgette and chia seeds! Of course there are other ways which I made a whole YouTube video on “volume oat combinations”, however grated courgette is my go to and would be my fave to add volume! ✨ Whenever I have a bowl of oats, it really does me well for a good 3-4 hours before I need to eat again, especially with the added chia seeds and courgette, making the bowl nutrient rich, high fibre and slower released sustainable carbs! ✨ Also, oats are so low calorie, which means I could have a much bigger portion as oppose to a bowl of cereal that probably won’t fill me up the same way!! And of course, oats make a fabulous base for lots and lots and lots and lotssss of toppings.. which you know I’m a fan of 🤣 I topped my bowl with banana slices, @koro_uk soy Crispies, @skinnyfoodco raspberry jam and @vego_chocolate white chocolate! Swipe for the texture 🤤👏🏼✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨For all sugar free jams, spreads and syrups, use my discount code LEILA4THREE which allows you to get the 4th product free on @skinnyfoodco products (please be aware, although I work with them, I don’t support their slogan of #notguilty .... it’s a load of poop 💩 I just love the taste of their products and I’d recommend them - just not the marmalade jam - please no 🤢) ✨🌿
user_0;user_013.jpg;🌿✨CaLoRieS, Calories, CALORIES, Kcals, FOOD! Here’s an update✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Disclaimers: As I always mention, my calories, your calories, Bob and Sally’s calories will be different! I can’t exaggerate enough how un-beneficial it is to copy how much someone requires whether that be to lose weight, gain or maintain weight! Another thing, everything I say comes from my experience and personal advice, whether you agree or disagree, is up to you, all I share is what has worked for me so take it like that! If you’re currently suffering from an eating disorder, you need to seek medical advice. Also, whether you track or not, there’s no right way to fitness so long as your feeding and fuelling yourself properly, deprivation is not cool! It’s up to you whether you like or dislike tracking calories, no shade thrown! Finally, if you do track, don’t feel like your trapped, restricted or need to obsessively follow it! It’s a tool and guide and not a way of undereating to see “quick results” ✨ For more detail on this subject, watch my “how to see progress” on YouTube as I’m limited to the word limit instagram allows on here! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🙋🏻‍♀️ Personal stats and goals: Age: 22 Height: 5ft on the dot 🙃 Weight: 48kg Current steps: 15-25k steps per day Training: 5-6 times a week! Current calories: 1750kcals (“cutting” kcals) Current calorie goals (post 10K calorie challenge) : reverse diet up to maintenance (explained in my YouTube video) - which for me is 1950kcals, when gyms re open, I plan to stay at maintenance and potentially be in a caloric surplus to fuel the increase load I’ll be lifting (miss that life 😭) !✨ As I mentioned, I will be light heartedly and for entertainment purposes only, be participating in the 10kcal calorie challenge for youtube - please note this isn’t something to aspire to, it’s completely unhealthy! I won’t be reducing my calories before or after the challenge!

If you follow me and didn’t know how much I love these @myproteinuk vegan baked cookies, where have you been living 🤣🤪✨ Macros for this Giant baked cookie choc pod (Meal sized serving for one/ breakfast on the go ): 537kcals 50C 20F 37P✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ My virtual Australian twinnn sistaaa from another mister, aka @run2food and I were both inspired by each other to recreate one of our recipes from each with a twist!! (Btw my fellow foodie friends food posts are incredible!!!)✨ so this is my variation of Michelle’s single serve snickers pod!! ✨ in the original recipe, Michelle used a soft protein bar as the base, but I went for a @myprotienuk vegan baked cookie and it banged 👏🏼 here’s the recipe 👇🏼✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📖 RECIPE - Meal sized serving for 1 - ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼 Base: one @myproteinuk vegan baked cookie ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼 Filling: 15g @myproteinuk smooth peanut butter, 2/ 3 tbsp water and 10g @myproteinuk vegan vanilla soy isolate protein powder ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼 Topping: 15g dark chocolate chips and 10g @myproteinuk vegan vanilla soy isolate protein powder ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👩‍🍳 Method: for the base, press the baked cookie into a mini dome shaped bowl to form the cookie cup and Place it in the microwave for 20 seconds. Working quickly, take it out of the microwave and further press down to form the shape of the cup and leave to cool. Whilst cooling, make the filling by mixing the two ingredients together! For the topping, melt the chocolate and then quickly whisk in the protein powder! Once the cup is cooled, place in the filling and topping!

user_0;user_015.jpg;🌿✨Full day of eating without protein supplements & Top vegan protein sources for a high protein diet! I also tried Chloe tings ab workout 🤣✨ New video live on my YouTube channel 🎥❤️ Waffleswithleila ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Within the video I share the importance of protein to support certain training routines but I also explain that protein isn’t a superior macro for building muscle or losing weight if that’s what you desire! A lot of people don’t have access or prefer not to use protein powder so I share how to implement protein within your diet without the use of supplements! ✨ Cutting update: I’ve been in a cut now for 2 months! I.e. I have slowly been reducing my calories from my maintenance calories by 50kcals every two weeks to reach my cutting kcals which I have maintained for 1 month now - for more information on calories, macros and how to effectively and sustainably see results, I have a whole video on my channel labelled “Reverse dieting”! ❤️ As I always highlight, everyone’s calories, journey and goals are different, so never feel the need to compare but I like to share for reference! Currently I’m cutting on 1750 kcals - I won’t be reducing any further than this because there’s no need to! I’m already below my maintenance by 200kcals - increasing the deficit via training and my steps! A lot of people think you have to drastically cut your calories to be able to see results! NOT AT ALL! It actually is very ineffective and not sustainable to do so!! 2/300 kcals below your maintenance is more than enough if you love food 🤣 personally I increase the deficit via exercise (which I don’t track- I just put all my efforts in) ✨ you NEVER want to be in too large of a deficit or overtraining, it’s damaging and counter intuitive! Trust me... I’ve been there, done that, learnt from it and came out of it with a lesson learnt!! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Let me know if you’d like a whole caption on what steps I’ll be taking next, when I’m ending my cut, how I’m coming out of it , what will I be doing, what my next goals are?!? I’d love to share if people are interested ❤️ ALSO, I’m now working with @beaybl ✨ link is in my bio ✨🌿

A simple but VERY effective breakfast, so we agree?? ✨ #pbandj ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ This however, isn’t any ordinary peanut butter 😅 of course I had to add some extraaaaanesss to it, for it to be a leilas breakfast kinda dish 🙃 I used 30g of @myproteinuk powdered peanut butter, mixed it with 10g @myproteinuk vanilla soy isolate AND 15g @lotusbiscoffuk spread 👏🏼👏🏼 Honestly such a COMBO!! That mix in combination with the @skinnyfoodco strawberry jam and sourdough bread in particular 👏🏼 levels up a PB&J sandwich 💯✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨For all @skinnyfoodco syrups, jams and spreads, I have a discount code “LEILA4THREE” which gets you the 4th product free when you buy 4 of their products!!

user_0;user_035.jpg;🌿✨ In a racist society it is not enough to be non racist. We must be anti-racist - Angela Y. Davies✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Ive really stuggled to put what had happened into my own words! I may not know the perfect thing to say or do but I know it’s better to speak up rather than to remain silent! I own up in saying that I’ve left it this long to share it on my feed and talk about it purely because it has really baffled me! I’ve shared it on my story but realise that stories are only temporary and are not seen by a wider audience in comparison to post! Over the past few days, it has come to my attention, that my platform is a voice and I can potentially educate or raise awareness to others in regards to George floyd and the many others that have suffered! It really really really disheartens me to think how any human can be treated in such way! Being born and raised in London, in particular central London where it is so diverse and multicultural, I did not grow up into thinking such thoughts about another race or even religion! Never would I treat anyone differently, or discriminate someone based on their background or skin colour and it sickens me to think that there are still people out there that do! I know I’m only one person and a single voice, but I’d like to make an impact in some way, whether that be big or small! So I urge you all to sign petitions, to self educate, to share the message, to read and listen so that we stand stronger together! Let me know how you’re contributing, whether that be sharing the message or in some other way?!? ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨My new youtube video is now live on my channel! It’s a weekend in my life: in quarantine! It includes a chocolate chip tahini cookie recipe, full body workout, my weekly food shop, @thevegankindsupermarket haul, youtube/ Netflix suggestions and just an overall chill/ get to know about me!

user_0;user_041.jpg;🌿✨Swipe to see what I want you to see VS. What I also want you to see!!!✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Your body is a reflection of your life. Everybody has a different story, we should never try and hide it or be ashes of it either!!✨ I’ve had a tonne of messages about how to get rid of “rolls” and “stretchmarks” as if I don’t have them! Of course I do! I’ve come from a history of yo yo dieting, jumping from one diet to the next and little depriving myself for an extended period time! This lead to stretch marks - which is where your skin is pulled by rapid growth and so it looses elasticity as the normal production of collagen is lost ✨ and thats why I love that quote of “your body is a reflection of your life” and it comes with a story!! ✨ it’s completely normal to have rolls, to have stretch marks and to all kinds of claimed “imperfections” which is hidden on this platform! ✨ it all stems from comparison, but there’s no need for it! Even though that can be easier said than done! Focus on your own body and your own journey! ✨ If i, or someone else wants to post a picture posed and flexed in a bikini or a cute gym set, I feel like we can without having to explain ourselves but it is nice to see that we all have little insecurities about ourselves that should be embraced ✌🏼 our bodies are a temple and should be respected! And I wish someone drilled that into my head when I was younger! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I thought I’d attach a little throwback to show the extremes of my journey, it wasn’t until I came to the acceptance of myself mentally and physically that I focused on what I wanted and achieved it! Every time I look back, I still get shook, but I always tell myself, I did that!! And I’m proud of it! So when I post photos of me posed and flexed, I worked for that and I’m not going to hide it #sorrynotsorry ! Please do unfollow if that’s not your tea! Take away message ... YOU IS BEAUTIFUL GURL! It’s not cringe and it’s not vein to say it to yourself, in fact SING IT to yourself! You is beautiful!! HAve a fabuloussss Friday! This will be my attire for the whole day 🤣👏🏼 clear skiesss today baby!! ✨ #throwback #transformation ✨🌿

Finally, I let the apples soak of the liquid until stewed down. ✨ The majority of the recipes in my ebook require protein powder because the ebook is aimed to be a high protein, macro friendly plant based recipe ebook! ✨ @myproteinuk currently have their 47% off birthday sale on until the 1st June, so if you need a little stock up, these are my top 10 product recommendations and what I personally restock on monthly : ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Vegan protein powders and soy isolates: my top flavours can be found in a previous post! 2️⃣ Powdered Peanut butter 3️⃣ Toffee, butter biscuit and strawberry flavour drops 4️⃣ Butterscotch or golden syrup sugar free syrup 5️⃣ Cacao powder & chia seeds 6️⃣ Creatine monohydrate, Vit d3, b12 & omega 7️⃣ Vegan carb crushers: Chocolate sea salt is my fave!

user_0;user_057.jpg;🌿✨ VEGAN PROTEIN POWDERS! Vegan blends and soy isolates! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨This isn’t a post saying you neeeed protein powder to build muscle, it’s often “sold” with that intention but honestly, if you get enough protein from your diet naturally, you can still build muscle (in conjunction with a caloric surplus and employment of progressive overload)! HOWEVER!! protein powder is super convenient, makes a fabuloussss ingredient in a lot of recipes, it’s super versatile and tastes absolutely delicious too!! Eg. I use them in my pancakes, waffles, oats, smoothie bowls and baked goods! ✨ So I thought I’d recommend my @myproteinuk @myvegan faves! ✨ Also, my new youtube video “Reverse dieting - My experience” has now been uploaded and is ready ✨ I talk about the right amount of protein for you in the video aswell ✌🏼 I know the video topic was highly requested! So let me know in the comments if you found it helpful! 🎥 Waffleswithleila ❤️✨ My favourites: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Vanilla soy isolate 2️⃣ Matcha soy isolate 3️⃣ strawberry soy isolate 4️⃣ Dark chocolate vegan blend 5️⃣ Cacao orange vegan blend 6️⃣ Blueberry and cinnamon vegan blend 7️⃣ Coffee and walnut vegan blend 8️⃣ Carrot cake vegan blend ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ You’ve probably seen me rave about the vanilla soy isolate, as it truly is my fave ❤️👏🏼 so that would be my top suggestion! I’ve recently tried the two new flavours of cacao orange and blueberry cinnamon - I was pleasantly surprised at both, the only thing with those is that they’re less versatile, so it depends if you’re looking for a specific taste or something you can adapt like the vanilla soy isolate! For the chocolate flavoured proteins, I’m not a fan of the chocolate soy or vegan blend but I do love the dark chocolate vegan blend ✨ I hope you found this helpful!! Let me know if you’ve tried any and which is your favourite flavour? ✨ Wearing @myproteinuk ✨ My discount code and link is in my bio - my specific link helps me with my protein so I really appreciate it when you use my link! 🥰✨🌿

I’m meant to be flying to Sydney, Australia in November for my birthday and I’m in two minds between whether I’d be able to go or not because of the worlds current affairs 💔 Australia is such a dreammmm destination for me and I’ve always said since I was a little chickpea, that I’d love to go! So when I finally booked it earlier this year, I was so happy!! One of the many many many reasons why I think Australia (in particular places like Byron bay, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney), is a dream for me is because of the beautiful and wonderful cafes they have there 😍 I constantly see them on my explore feed and I find them super inspiring!! Which led me to create this dish for my breakfast which was particularly inspired by a cafe called @thetradesmancafe in Melbourne! ✨ The pudding is actually my chocolate protein pudding recipe from my ebook - I just swapped out the choc protein powder and cacao powder with the @myproteinuk matcha soy isolate! (The link to my breakfast allll day ebook is in my bio) ❤️✨ I then decided to decorate it as if I was sitting in an instagrammable cute Australia cafe in the sun... a girl can dream 🤣 ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Have you been to Australia before? Are you from Australia? Tag your favourite Australian cafes so I can have a browse, I loveee loooking a them 😍👏🏼 Let me know!👇🏼✨🌿

HERE IT IS!! I made these vegan mozzarella sticks and they worked out well!! The cheese I used was @violife_foods cheese! They’re my favourite vegan brand of cheese!

It’s the only cheese I find that melts really well, doesn’t taste like plastic and is enjoyable!! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📖 RECIPE (makes 3 sticks - 1 serving size): ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ 1 slice bread toasted ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ 10g flour ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ Just some water on the side to dip ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4️⃣ 45g @violife_foods cheese block ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👩‍🍳 Method: Blend the toasted bread slice in a blender to make into bread crumbs. Place the formed bread crumbs in a dish and season with garlic and onion powder. Place flour into a separate dish and water in another. Cut the block into 3 equal sticks. Place one stick first in the water, roll in the flour, and repeat, then roll in the breadcrumbs and pop onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Repeat this process for the remaining two sticks!

user_0;user_067.jpg;🌿✨Sometimes flex...Othertimes relaxed... 🌚🙃✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Dont ever think I walk around like this or look like this when I’ve eaten a full day of food, it’s just not possible 😅 but why do I only share that aspect of my bod on my profile?! Because I use my platform to hopefully motivate people in some rational way! But of course that doesn’t mean I’m a walking around like Arnold Schwarzenegger all day ! Yes I’m physically lean because I work for it, you see photos of me in the best lighting I’ve hunted down, the best angle, me holding my breathe and flexing so hard for my abs and muscles to show! Does that make me “fake” or being “untrue” certainly not! We alll get full tummies after we’ve fed our bodies with love! It’s completely natural! ✨ Although it may seem that I’m always up and about, I do have times where I chill and just relax! Love your bod in every shape and form it comes in! It’s completely fine to have an aesthetic goal! I always preach that it’s a good thing to work towards if that’s something you want to do! But never feel pressured, compare yourself to others or discourage yourself! ✨ See this platform as as a platform to gain more knowledge and inspo from, not a battle between you and your mental state! ✨ we all have those times where we want to change things about ourselves because we’ve seen somebody else’s features, and like I say, it’s great to aspire to something but not okay for it to lead to hatred upon yourself! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I really hope we’ve all had a bloody fabulous bank hol friyayyy! If it’s as sunny where you are as where I am, I hope you fully enjoyed it from your balcony, garden, local park in isolation 🥰I went for a stroll in my local rookery, and it was such a stress relief to get out, smell and see nature!

user_0;user_070.jpg;"🌿✨ Homemade breaded tofu fillet with polenta chips, peas and spicy dip!✨ Macros for the meal: 378kcals 55C 8F 22P ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I recently discovered a pack of polenta at my local Tesco extra and being foodie, going to different restaurants and all, I always use to see “polenta” on some menus! Often in the form of a pudding or specialised bread! ✨ So I thought id be a creative nut and explore how I could use it! ✨ After doing a bit of a google search (whilst in the 80m que at Tesco to checkout my weekly shop items 🙃 relateable?) I discovered that you can do so many things with polenta!! ✨ I also read some nutritional benefits of it, such as; it’s high fibre and protein content, it’s low calorie and in particular fat, provides a source of complex carbs and vitamin A, it’s also gluten free! ✨ For dinner on this particular day, I went for polenta chips! All I did was cut up 150g of the block of polenta into wedges and seasoned them with paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powder, placed them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and baked them for 15 mins - no oil required, they still crisp and stay soft on the inside! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📖 RECIPE for the tofu - 1 serve: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ I used 80g block of @tofooco firm tofu ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ 1 slice of bread - toasted and blended into bread crumbs ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ 10ml soy sauce/ tamari/ coconut aminos ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4️⃣ 10g flour ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👩‍🍳 Method: Dip the tofu in the soy sauce and then the flour. Dip in soy sauce again and flour, repeat this process until it’s all used up. Finally dip and flip in the breadcrumbs! Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper and cook for 15-20mins on 180c! For the dip I mixed 1tbsp of tomato purée with cayenne pepper, smoked paprika and black pepper! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿 ✨ Have you tried polenta before? Let me know what you use it for!! I can’t wait to get more creative with it!!✨ Let me know if you give this recipe a go by tagging me in your posts and stories!! ❤️ lots of love xox ✨🌿"

They’re filled and equip you with happiness... it’s a fact 🤣✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨I will never stop raving about these @myproteinuk @myvegan baked and goey filled cookies! As a sponsored @myproteinuk ambassador my opinions are not biased, I’d call them out if they weren’t top notch but I honestly can’t fault these 🤤 my favourite thing to do with them are to hear them in the microwave for 30 secs 👏🏼 I usually have them on their own, topped with ice cream or custard! I even use them as part of my breakfasts!! ✨ You can heat them up, roll them into balls and make bite sized cookie balls! If you can crumble them up and mould them together to form a base of a breakfast tart 🙃 they’re quite versatile and I have so many ideas on how to use them!! ✨ have you tried these cookies before ? Let me know which flavour is your fave!! I’d have to say the goey filled cookie or the salted caramel baked cookie 👏🏼✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Salted caramel baked cookie 2️⃣ Chocolate chip baked cookie 3️⃣ Double chocolate chip baked cookie 4️⃣ Goey filled salted caramel cookie ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ My discount code and link can be found in my bio!

user_0;user_072.jpg;"🌿✨ Vegan Chive Cream cheese fettuccine and glazed mushroom! 🤤 using @nushfoods #gifted ✨ macros: 197kcals 23C 6F 11P ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I’ve recently been loving the cream cheese pasta combo! Love how yummy and comforting it is! Its also a fabulous base of nutritious meal! I mixed 1 tbsp of @nushfoods with some garlic, onion powder and 2 packs of @myproteinuk konjac fettuccine noodles! I then added my greens of choice; steamed petite pois peas, kale and broccoli! On top I placed a grilled Portobello mushroom! ✨ My all time favouriteeee way to flavour mushrooms is by marinading them with 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar free syrup, some paprika, cayenne pepper and garlic powder! ✨ For this dish I cut up a Portobello mushroom into slices, seasoned it and then chargrilled in a pan ✨ Love how mushrooms can be a great foundation to a meal aswell! They’re so versatile and come in different forms, such as oyster mushrooms and shiitake, those two would definitely be my faves!! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨How do you like to use cream cheese in a dish? Let me know! Sweet or savoury! ✨🌿"
user_0;user_073.jpg;🌿✨ REVERSE DIETING✨ The method and concept of reverse dieting can be applied going up or down! It’s so useful but so underrated due to common misconceptions! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Reverse dieting actually works on your metabolism. With reverse dieting, you’re slowly and steadily increasing or decreasing your calories while (hopefully) minimizing the amount of fat you gain or loose to allow your metabolism to adapt with what your goals are! Typically a reverse diet is employed after a caloric deficit where you’ll get to consume more calories without the extra weight once you’re done (this is a very slow and controlled process - not weeks but months of change and adaptation) ✨ but I also employ reverse dieting after a caloric surplus as I’ve found over the years, the more slower you are at creating a deficit - the better results you achieve and that’s because you’re giving your bod enough time! ✨ To be able to understand how to reverse diet and how your body functions as such, you must understand the difference between TDEE , BMR and the factors which play with someone’s caloric intake!✨ This lifestyle of “cutting” and “bulking” is not for everyone, I completely understand that but just respect how others choose to live their life! Personally I find both really effective in building and maintaining a strong but healthy looking physique in terms of aesthetics! ✨ I’m also well aware that aesthetics is not the ultimate goal or reason to why I love training, but I love working towards a goal so I do train to look how I want to look and that’s totally fine!! What’s not fine is being too hard on yourself, pressuring yourself to do things you don’t want to or just stressing out about it✌🏼 just know that everything takes time! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I have many things to touch on for this topic, too much for an Instagram caption and the word limit 😅 so I’ll be making a YouTube video on this topic to refresh from my previous uploads and update/ inform you on my current knowledge and experience of it! 🎥 Waffleswithleila ✨ wearing @myproteinuk @officialmp snakeprint set!

user_0;user_080.jpg;🌿✨ VEGAN JAPANESE INSPIRED SOUFFLÉ PROTEIN PANCAKES!! Topped with @alpro custard of course 😅✨ Macros (without toppings): 387kcals 41C 8F 37P ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Basicallllllyy!! Im really missing going out and exploring the amazing cafes in London so I decided to be a cafe chef for my self 😅 these pancakes are inspired by a cafe in London called @fuwafuwalondon ! I’ve always wanted to visit! However, their pancakes are not vegan, I just think they look epicc! Do we agreee? Have you visited this cafe before? Let me know! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📖 RECIPE (makes 6 soufflé pancakes for one!) : ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ 60g flour ( I used spelt but you may use gluten free, plain or self raising, not almond or coconut flour) 2️⃣ 30g @myproteinuk vanilla soy isolate (or vegan protein alternative, whey is a different consistency and will alter the recipe!) 3️⃣ 150ml @alpro unsweetened almond milk (or plant based milk alternative - soy, oat, coconut) 4️⃣ 5g coconut oil 5️⃣ 10g @natvialiving sweetner ( can be substituted for a dry sweetener alternative or sugar, but sugar will alter the macros) 6️⃣ 1/2 tsp baking powder, some salt, a squeeze of a lemon ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👩‍🍳 Method: Combine the almond milk with the baking powder, salt and lemon juice. Melt there coconut oil and combine with the liquid mixture. Combine the dry ingredients together. Whisk whisk whisk the two mixtures together! To make the foil shaped rings to form the Soufflé style pancakes, I rolled out 6 pieces of foil. For each piece I rolled lengthways to form 6 rectangles. I then formed them into mini circles by stapling together the ends of the desired shape! (Alternatively if you have cookie cutters the same size you can use those, the only benefit of the foil, is that you can cut on around the edges once complete to prevent damage to the pancakes!) Then, heat a non stick pan, place the pancake batter in the 6 mini rings. Cook on one side, place a lid on top to allow the mixture to rise! Flip to cook on the other side! Then addd alll the toppings in the world and share them with me by tagging me in your recreations!! ❤️✨

user_0;user_083.jpg;🌿✨ Goal Setting ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Big or small, setting goals are a fabulous way to work towards something and stay motivated! Fitness, non fitness related, goals can be short term, goals can be long term, future goals and current goals! I like setting goals as I love to feel like Ive achieved something, so that I can look back on and feel accomplished! However, I suggest setting goals that you can manage, able to stick to and are reachable! I often think of a goal, but it’s more likely a dream just because it’s probably something out of my reach! I thought I’d share a few of mine, some more current than others: ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼 Current: I’ve set myself a goal to cycle to work at least one day during the week instead of taking public transport! I’ve set one day, typically a Thursday because I know if I set all my 5 day working week to cycle, it wouldn’t be manageable or I just won’t stick to it! This is along side sticking to my current 6 days a week training split which I mentioned in my previous post! I’ve also set a goal, on days that I have off work, to perform a 30 min LISS cardio session (walk on the treadmill) before breakfast! Both I’ve been able to stick to for several weeks, so I’d like to keep reaching the goals I set until they’re Integrated within my routine! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼 Future: Id say these were more dreams than goals but I thought I’d share anyway, as I would like to think dreams can come true and it can potentially happen 🤣😅 I would love love loveee the opportunity to work with a brand and to come up with and create a product/ add a flavour to their current products, with them that is available in supermarkets and would have my face on the back 🙃 orrr have my own instagrammable breakfast cafe which people would purposefully visit to get photos for the gram... can you imagine 👏🏼 goalssss! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Let me know what your goals are, small or big! I’d love to know and It would be a great read to others aswell! ✨ btw I cut these @myproteinuk @officialmp leggings into cycling shorts and they’re cute af ✨👏🏼🌿

I then sealed the pockets with the end of a fork and popped them in the oven for 10 mins to crisp. For the curry I used 100g soy mince, some grated carrots, peas, courgette and spinach with tomato purée and curry seasoning! I served the pockets with the remaining curry and some extra spinach ✨Dessert: I had @breyersdelightsuk vegan chocolate hazelnut ice cream with frozen berries and I also made a hot chocolate using 1 cup almond milk heated in the microwave, 1 tsp of cacao powder and sweetened with 1 drop of a @myproteinuk whites chocolate flavour drop ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Dinner: I baked some tofu, polenta chips, Portobello mushroom and sweet pepper, served with kale, red cabbage, broccoli and green beans ✨ I’ve never tried polenta before, so I thought I’d give them a go = 🤤🤤! ✨ For dessert I made a one serve fudgy ball using 10g @myproteinuk powdered peanut butter, 5g agave nectar and 5g cacao powder, mixed with 3 tbsp water to form a ball.

user_0;user_093.jpg;🌿✨ Pesto pasta with roasted courgette, seasoned kale and petit pois peas, using my faaave pesto from @zest.plantpower 🤤 ✨ Listen people CARBS ARE LIFE 👏🏼✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨I can’t even record the number of messages I’ve received about carbs, requests for lower carb recipes and low carb diets in relation to weight loss! I often get people saying they’re confused how I can eat so many carbs and remain lean, it’s pretty simple! Carbs by them selves don’t determine if you loose weight or not. Carbs are one of three essential macronutrients ! No macronutrients is superior, each plays a vital role in your body and how it functions. Restricting your bod to such an extent from a certain micronutrient is not going to benefit you. So things like “keto” “Atkins” and all these gibberish diets are not more beneficial than a basic diet. What matters in every way shape and form is your caloric intake! You eat more, you gain, you eat less, you loose (in veryyy basic terms - it doesn’t happen with a click of a finger , it’s a slow and controlled process for each). Understandably, everyone is different and how your body may react to a certain macronutrient split will vary, but for the average person, it doesn’t apply! ✨ personally I’ve always followed 50/25/25 macro split regardless as to whether I’m trimming or gaining! ✨ But in saying that, like I said, it’s your calories which matter most! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ what’s your opinion? Do you follow a certain split! Let a gal know 👇🏼👇🏼✨🌿

But can you imagine them dipped in oats? 🤔😍👏🏼✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📖 RECIPE (serves 10): ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - For the Peanut butter filling: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 100g @myproteinuk powdered peanut butter (can be substituted for usual peanut butter - but the macros will change respectively), 7g coconut oil, 15g @myproteinuk sugar free syrup, 30g @myproteinuk vanilla soy isolate protein (or an alternative vegan blend) and 1/2 a cup of water ⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ - For the chocolate coating: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 100g dark melting chocolate, 7g coconut oil ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👩‍🍳 Method: start by making the filling by mixing all of the ingredients together in a bowl (melt the coconut oil before mixing). Once combined, shape into Easter eggs and pop into the fridge to firm up for 20-30 mins. In the mean time, prepare the chocolate coating by combing and melting the two ingredients respectively. Take the peanut butter eggs out of the fridge, dip into the melted chocolate and place them on the wrack to harden. The temperature difference between the eggs and the chocolate coating, allows the chocolate to harden quicker, if not, allow them to harden in the fridge for another 10 mins... alternatively you can go rouge and just gobble some up straight away 🙃🙃🙃 Store them in the fridge, they can last for up to week!! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Save this recipe, give it a go and Let me know ❤️ ✨ #easter #chocolate #chocolateegg ✨🌿
user_0;user_0113.jpg;🌿✨ Staying motivated and Managing my time! Swipe for he reality of my life right now! 💀 🏥 ✨🌿 ✨ So this week I’m doing three 12 hour shifts in A&E which means I work 3 days during the week and I have 4 days off! I’ll be training 5 times this week as oppose to 6 times, mainly because the stress those shifts have on my body and the 2 days of rest really help! ✨ My training split will consist of 3 lower bod days and 2 upper bod days with 3 core sessions, 2 HIIT sessions and LISS cardio (step goal 15-25k) during the week ✨ Ways that set me up for the start until the end of the week, to keep me motivated and focused include: 👉🏼Scheduling and writing up my workouts for each day of the week. 👉🏼Having an idea of what I’d like to have for each meal during the week (untracked) just so that I can do one weekly food shop rather than several times during the week. 👉🏼 The night before each day - I track my meals. If it’s the day before a working day during long day shifts I prep it the day before, if it’s a day before during normal shifts, I prep the majority of the meals at the start of the week so that I can just grab and go healthy homemade meals each day without relying on convenience. 👉🏼Writing up a weekly/ daily to do list in my planner to know certain tasks that I wish to complete for each day - maximum of 3 to ensure that I can manage my time efficiently and allow myself rest at the same time whilst I’m off work. 👉🏼Each day, from when I wake up to when I go to bed I write up what I’d like to do each hour of the day so that I can get more things done in the day and so that I still have a routine and structure during the week! 👉🏼 The day before each day, I also lay out my gym kit - I don’t consider training at home an excuse to wear pjammys as I find that I feel less dedicated to work out, so I separate my pjammys, from my gymwear to the clothing I wear during the day, so that my mind can differentiate between everything more easier whilst staying at home! 🌿✨Off for the remaining of this week, working Sat and Sun! Luckily London has blessed us with good weather the days I’m off! ✨ Wearing @officialmp @myproteinuk loungewear - links in my bio with a discount code ❤️✨🌿
user_0;user_0114.jpg;🌿✨ Carrot matcha garden patch oatmeal bowl 🐰 🥕 ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ 🙃 You’ll have to be imaginative with this one!! I made a yummy matcha and carrot oatmeal bowl in my @shopcocabana coconut bowl topped with choc bunnies, one crushed weetabix and blueberries! ✨ Even though were all isolating, Easter is still happening - which means loads of choccc melts in bowls of oats 🤤 ✨ For the oatmeal bowl I used: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - 60g oats - 1 scoop of @myvegan matcha soy isolate - 5g @myproteinuk chia seeds - 1 cup almond milk - A grated carrot 🥕 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I like to cook my oatmeal in a pot on a stove! I find that the protein doesn’t clump and the oats are more creamier, as oppose to heating it all in a microwave! Another way you can prevent clumping is mix the liquid with the protein powder initially until smooth and then combine with the remaining ingredients in the pot! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Currently in my way to work to start my 12 hour shift, meals and snacks ready to set me up for the day and power through!!

user_0;user_0117.jpg;🌿✨ If you can’t remember my name, just say hummus and I’ll turn around 🤣🙃✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Seriously loving this combo at the minute! I sautéed some mushrooms in 1 tsp of agave nectar, tamari (can be substituted for soy sauce or coconut aminos) paprika, cayenne pepper, onion and garlic powder. I then placed it on top of a bagel spread with a layer of hummus and the two together is sooo good! Highly recommended! I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top - partially because it made the dish look prettier ( #guilty ) but also because I love sesame, especially tahini!! ✨ Bowl details? I served the bagel for my lunch with some kale, Pickled red cabbage, and grilled tofu! I get my tofu from @tofooco which you can buy in most stores and I grill it in my @georgeforemanuk grill - no oil or anything, I just love the flavour of it plain when grilled 🤤👏🏼✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Who else is a fan of hummus?

user_0;user_0121.jpg;"🌿✨ Mini Hassleback potatoes with chilli con carne, a side of greens and unsweetened so yogurt! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ A yummy and nutritious Lunch/Dinner options, providing all the essential macro and micronutrients! ✨ White or Sweet potatoes? ✨  There’s a common misconception that one is better than the other, when it’s not the case! It’s just that white potatoes are deemed less “healthy” due to how it’s typically usually used, Ie. fries 🍟 Although it’s quite popular to find sweet potato fries nowadays too! But even then, people think that the sweet potato fries would be the “better” option. Actually, the sweet potato fries tend to be more calorific . White potatoes and sweet potatoes have complementary nutritional differences; one isn’t necessarily better than the other. For instance, sweet potatoes have more fiber and vitamin A, but white potatoes are higher in essential minerals, such as iron, magnesium, and potassium. Ultimately, the type of potato you have in your meal is completely down to preference! ✨ To make the hassleback potatoes, I made small slits with a knife and sprayed with some fry light oil, placed in the oven for 30 mins to back and crispen! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Which potato forever you prefer? White or sweet!? Let me know ❤️✨🌿"

user_0;user_0123.jpg;🌿✨ Vegan ribs? 🤪 loving these tempeh bbq ribs from @plantpowerfoods ✨ Happy monday all! Did anyone else think that this Sunday felt like the sunday-ist of sundays, of all sundays ever? 🙃🙃🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Yesterdays lunch was super delicious! If you asked me what my favourite vegan sources of protein are, tempeh would definitely be one of them! I also love love love tofu, seitan and soy mince! ✨ Tofu and tempeh are much more accessible in larger supermarkets nowadays, where as seitan isn’t so much! I usually have to source that, if I fancy it, from places like planet organic or the whole foods store! ✨ However, seitan can actually be homemade, as it’s made from wheat, so I may be an experimental bean and try and make my own sometime 😅 Had anyone made there own seitan before? ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Alsoooo, my new YouTube video is now live on my channel! “Instagram decides what I eat in a day” - I really enjoyed making this video!! A lot of the suggestions were sooo yummy and amazing - and the ones selected for the video, were fabulous 👏🏼👏🏼 check out the video for some meal ideas and little life updates! ❤️🎥 Waffleswithleila 🎥❤️ Let me know what you think! ✨🌿
user_0;user_0124.jpg;🌿✨Training update | What am I doing differently? ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I’ve fully accepted that gyms are not going to be open for a fair while but it will only be temporary! Going to the gym, lifting weights, and just exercise in general, is a big part of my life! So I didn’t see closure of the gyms as an opportunity to drop that part of my life! I’ve just adapted my technique so that I could carry on with what I love!✨ I’m incredibly grateful and fortunate enough to have the equipment that I do have in my room ( very old equipment from previous years - I bought them from Argos) because I know it’s a real struggle/ not practical to buy a bundle of equipment just for a short period of time! ✨ But that doesn’t mean you’ll loose muscle or what you’ve achieved in the gym! Your body is a clever little thing and has muscle memory! What you need to make sure you’re doing is creating a constant stimulus for muscle fibres to break during your workouts, refuelling your bod with food to rebuild and repeat! ✨ So you may not have the equipment but you can use hypertrophic/ endurance training to have a similar effect! ✨ When the gyms reopen - you may not be at the strength you were currently at but you wouldn’t of lost it completely, it will just take some time after! ✨ Here’s my home workout adapted, current split during the week: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - 6 workouts a week in total - 15k-25k step goal range - Mon - legs - Tue - upper, core, HIIT - Wed - legs - Thur - upper, core, HIIT - Fri - legs - Sat - Full body routine/ workout video/ yoga - Sun - active rest day, stretching ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ My calories are still at 1900kcals in total until next week, as it would be the fortnightly drop in my reverse diet phase where I’ll go down to 1850kcals - for more information on how to figure out your personal macros, reverse dieting and more, head over to my YouTube playlist “how to see progress” at Waffleswithleila ❤️ 🎥✨Lwt me know what your current workout split is? ✨ Wearing: @doyoueven @doyouevenwomen #doyouevenwomen ✨🌿
user_0;user_0125.jpg;🌿✨ Choco melt oats!! 🤤 ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I really don’t think you can beat melting chocolate in a bowl of oats, and as it becomes closer and closer to Easter, you know it will be happening a lot more often 🙃🙃 What’s your favourite chocolate to melt in oats? I loveee these new vegan chocolate bars by @loveraw they’re so creamy and melt like a dream 😍 #gifted ! In this @shopcocabana coconut bowl I have 65g oats, 1 scoop of dark chocolate @myvegan blend protein powder, 1/2 a grated courgette, 300ml almond milk 5g chia seeds and 5g cacao powder ! Topped with the chocolate bar, banana slices, blueberries, some cacao nibs, shredded coconut and chocolate soy Krispies from @koro_uk ✨ Just out of curiosity, how do you like to cook your oats, on the stove or in the microwave? I much prefer on the stove! They come out so much more creamier and I find that the protein combines better! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Today’s plans consist of attempting a food shop at Tesco’s 😅 who else feels a bit resistant towards a food shop nowadays? It’s just manic! Luckily they have a browsing hour at 10am on a Sunday for NHS staff, so I’ll be making full use of that 👏🏼✨ I’ll also be prepping my week for the meals ahead, editing a YouTube video and spending time with my family... probably grace trying to make me do another tik tok dance with her 🤣✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Rest day for me today, but I’ll be making sure that I’m getting 15k + steps in (my daily step goals) and some mobility work to set me up for a good week of home workouts ahead! ✨ Have a fabulous Sunday all! ❤️ Let me know what you’ve got planned for today? ✨🌿

One of my faves was “A smile can travel further than two metres” - that’s something I live by with or without COVID but it really kept me going through the week! ✨ You can choose to be happy but positivity is a mindset! ✨ I love trying to see the best out of things rather than go around in circles about something negative! ✨ This weekend I plan to make more of an effort to chill with my family - one thing ive seen @stephelswood do especially, is schedule in that time as well as a phone free time! It’s so easy to just scroll for years over the weekend, but especially when there’s time, pausing, being grateful and being appreciative of the smaller things is so magical ❤️✨ Let me know your weekend plans? ✨ #vegan #fitness #fit #wearetala #saturday #weekend #positivity #sustainablefashion #sustainableliving #sustainable #gym #workouts #plantbased ✨🌿

user_0;user_0128.jpg;🌿✨ Full day of eating and physique update!✨ If you’re an OG you’ll know how frequently I used to post the same layout as this when I first started my fitness journey! 😅 I thought I’d reintroduce it as I know people found it helpful in terms of meal ideas ✨ As I always mentioned in the past, my calories are calories specific requirements for my bod and own self! So me sharing them to you, shouldn’t be an opportunity to copy them! ✨ As I’ve addressed in my previous YouTube videos with a proper explanation of the process, I’m currently still reverse dieting down into my caloric deficit kcals! ✨ Where as before I had to go quite low for my bod to get to a leaner structure, my metabolism has adapted respectively, therefore I don’t need to go as low as I did (1650kcals) - please be aware of the process of reverse dieting! ✨ So during my build I went up to 2150kcals, I then at the end of it, every fortnight I reduced by 50 kcals, which has lead to my current kcals of 1900kcals - my plan is to continue doing so until I reach my lowest cutting kcals for this year of 1700kcals! ✨ The reasoning im sharing my specific kcals is because people assume that you have to eat extremely low when wanting to achieve a leaner physique, when it’s actually the complete opposite! Your body needs energy to fuel processes, when you go to low, your metabolism dramatically slows down and so it’s harder for you to reach your goals! ✨ Also, please note, what I eat in a day typically changes on a day to day basis! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ On this particular day, I trained in the morning so as my 🍽 pre workout snack I had a homemade protein cinnamon swirl - which was a recipe I halved from my ebook! 🍽 Breakfast- pumpkin cookie dough (also in my ebook) topped with salted caramel popcorn 🍽 Mid morning snack - @loveraw salted caramel chocolate bar 🍽 Lunch - smashed avo on toast, @lindamccartneyfoods chorizo sausages, cucumber, carrots, kale, alfalfa sprouts and sourdough croutons 🍽 Dessert - lotus seed pops and blueberries 🍽 Dinner - spinach, tofu, sweet potato, roasted courgette and turmeric cauliflower , pickled red cabbage and hummus 🍽 Dessert - milky tumeric tea ✨🌿

user_0;user_0132.jpg;🌿✨ 5 QUARANTINE TIPS ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Its quite easy to fall out of routine when your at home everyday! ✨ I’ve never been so fortunate to still be able to go to work knowing that I’m helping a good cause! But I know for a lot of you, going to work is out of the question ✨ This is our new normal and I’ve finally excepted it! ✨ I thought it would be super helpful to share some tips during these uncertain times and offer some reassurance! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Stick to a routine - everyday, the night before, write up a schedule for the following day. From the minute until you wake up until you head off to bed! I do this in my day to day life either way, but I find it really helps motivate me to get up and move so I’m able to do more things in the day! 2️⃣ Set yourself a focus for the day - writing an intention for each day can help with working towards a goal. Eg. Being active and staying hydrated! I suggest focusing on staying active everyday - whether that be incorporating some interval training, resistance or functional, maybe a walk in the park or on a treadmill, some Pilates or yoga - anything to get the blood circulating and increase your pulse rate! 3️⃣ When you split your day make sure you incorporate your meals including breakfast lunch, dinner and snacks - I would suggest writing a food diary and know what you’re eating each day - that way you’ll stay accountable and not snacking recklessly throughout the day (easily done)!! 4️⃣ Ensure that your meals contain a distributed amount of macro and micronutrients! It’s so important to focus on your nutrition during this time when it comes to the goals you had set yourself before this madness came about - whether that be being in a caloric surplus or deficit! 5️⃣ Meditate! I know for some this can be difficult or is a bit wishy washy! But meditation is great for stress relief! Challenge your self to set 10-15 mins aside for stillness and mindfulness to ease your thoughts and to relax! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Hope this helps!! Write your top tips down below/ what you’ve been doing during these very odd times so others can read! ✨@pursuefitness ✨🌿

user_0;user_0138.jpg;🌿✨ Physique update, Ab workout, COVID - 19 and Training 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ Firstly, id like to touch on my physique update before we get on to the hot topic right now, I’m feeling slightly fuller in parts of my bod as I’m still in the phase of transitioning between my bulking and shreddy kcals via reverse dieting (spoken about on my YouTube channel) Next week I’ll be going into my next phase, working towards my goals for this year! Nevertheless, I’m loving my workouts at the moment, hitting pbs and my current training split! I’ll be filming a FDOE video over the weekend to upload next week on my channel for the next chapter of my goals! ✨ Secondly, with many things going on in the world right now- I haven’t addressed it as it’s very draining! The best thing I would say is to be responsible for your own actions and stay assertive! ✨ Personally, I’m still training at my usual gym - your nutrition & exercise regime is vital for the strengthening of your immune system! So I would advise to stay active! Yes you don’t need a gym to stay active & there are other ways to employ exercise but that’s my preference - you go at your own risk! ✨ Understandably gyms can be a hub for infection but being hygienic - wiping down the surfaces and being clean after your sessions can reduce the risk of infection! ✨ A large number, are understandably self isolating and are using home workouts (as advised - I’m not saying to ignore) but I would also reassure you not to be afraid and be anxious about the whole situation! ✨ Everyone is in the same boat and I’m absolutely loving all the support I’m seeing as I scroll through the explore page! We can all help each other! What are your thoughts? ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Swipe for an ab routine I vouch for a killer core session - give it a go ✨ 3x10 - Hanging leg raises Ssw/ knee tucks, weighted jackknifes Ssw/ weighted sit ups, bench reverse crunches ❤️ wearing @pursuefitness sports bra and seamless thongs #gifted ✨ #training #fitness #covid19 ✨🌿

As a Londoner myself, I’ve never stayed in a London hotel for obvious reasons! So I’ve not really appreciated the absolute beauty of London from a tourist aspect before! As I’ve lived here my whole life I know London really quite well, I’ve done the sites, theatres and all the other amazing ness that is London, but I’ve never experienced an overnight stay at a London hotel! At dorsett city, the hospitality, location and interior design was absolutely fabulous! We were greeted with smiles and cupcakes (not vegan though 🙃 I had the raspberries whilst my boyfriend hoovered up both pancakes)! Our room had a hallway with a work space, en suite bathroom and a mega view! They have a gym, 2 restaurants on sight and a beautiful room top bar which overlooks London’s beauty! Highly recommend this hotel if you’re making a trip down! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I’ve filmed my whole weekend for my YouTube which will be live this evening at 6pm on my channel: Waffleswithleila ❤️ I had to film my ebook launch event for the memories as it was such a lovely day with the most loveliest girlies!

It’s what you can do and how you can flavour vegetables to make them the centre of the dish!

Usually after a morning workout, I’m really quite energised and ready to start my day but it just wasn’t the case today! ✨ This evening I got invited to a PR event with @h2clubs in aid of their new gym opening, I was ready for a 45 min HIIT workout with other fitness bloggers ❤️✨ I was really looking forward to it! But for some reason, after I finished my shift at work and actually making my route to the event (quite close by to my workplace) I got off the bus and turned back to go home... I just had a mind fog and a bit of anxiety towards it! ✨ I just had one of those day today where I just needed to do a lot of breathing and stop overthinking things! ✨ it’s okay to take a break from things! If you’re having a down day just relax and take a moment to breathe! I don’t usually just bail out of things unexpectedly but today I did and that’s okay - I just don’t think going to an intense workout class after a mornings legs session, busy day at work and things on my mind was ideal for me today!✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I have an event in manchester tomorrow which I need to leave early morning for, so I’m just going to really relax this evening and do some mindfulness! I just thought I’d share because I’m quite an optimistic and positive person which I’m hopeful that it comes across that way on my posts, but there are days when I’m just feeling down which I’m sure we can all relate with ❤️✨ Have a lovely evening all! ✨ Wearing: @doyouevenwomen @doyoueven ✨🌿

user_0;user_0158.jpg;🌿✨ Nutrition ✨ Do you find yourself constantly snacking or craving food? 🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I’m sure you’re fully aware that the right nutrition leads to the most sustainable results! ✨ Without eating enough, you’re not going to go far with your progression! ✨Also, without feeding yourself with substantial meals, snacks and being hydrated throughout the day, you tend to crave food! ✨ Craving food shouldn’t be ignored in my opinion, If you fancy something, have it! Just have a portion size of it! ✨ However, I don’t find myself craving foods all the time because I make sure I’m eating foods high in volume and nutrition! ✨ Not only do I love the way I eat on a day to day basis, I’m not afraid to eat foods I wouldn’t usually because I fancy it or over social events✨ Other reasons you may be experiencing craving food all the time, may be because: 1️⃣ Not eating balanced meals: ensuring you’re getting an adequate amount of each macronutrients, is going to prevent you from constantly craving food! Each macronutrient is just as important as the other! 2️⃣ Irregular eating habits: try to keep your eating times as consistent as possible - obviously it’s not always possible but your bod likes to keep to a routine and consistency! 3️⃣ Lack of sleep: often, a lack of sleep can make you feel more hungry because your body is craving more energy! Sleeping recharges your bod and is sooo important when repairing muscle fibres and other processes in your body! 4️⃣ Food rules or restrictions: trying to stop yourself from eating foods you love, will make you want it more! Having it in small amounts - little and often/ when you like is better than taking it completely away from your diet! 5️⃣ Poor gut health: your gut flora plays a huge part of your digestion and even your mental clarity- ensuring you’re getting in a great source of probiotics will help balance your gut flora out! ✨Although I’m all about IIFYM and #BALANCE ✌🏼eating foods higher in nutrients, greater volume and more fulfilling, will always be more beneficial for you than constantly eating highly processed foods! ✨ Let me know what you think 👇🏼✨🌿

user_0;user_0168.jpg;🌿✨ How will I manage my training around my work shifts? ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ I’ve had many questions recently asking how I manage training whilst doing 12 hour shifts! It’s usually from others who do shifts at work or other allied health occupations!✨When deciding to be a diagnostic radiographer and going through the course as a student, as well as being a fitness enthusiast, I realised that planning is essential! Planning and organising allows me to keep up with my target of training 5 times per week!✨ My work schedule is either shifts for 3 long days (8-8pm) 4 days off or normals 8-4pm, 8:30-4:30pm, 9-5pm, 9:30- 5:30pm, 10-6pm, 11:00-8pm, mon- fri per week! ✨A lot of the times I’m just doing normals and I can definitely manage to go gym before or after work! ✨ but when it comes to my shifts, I have to manage my time a bit more strategically to be able to fit in 5 times a week! ✨ Arguably I could just do 4 times full body on those weeks, but I love/ prefer the 5 times individual muscle group split! ✨ So for the 4 days I have off, I go to the gym for sure and on 1/3 of the long days I go to the gym before! ✨ which means I wake up at 4am for that particular day to give myself 2 hours to go to the gym - including stretching, mobility work and contingency! And then it takes me 40 mins to get to work by bus! ✨ Throughout my days, I ensure that I’m fuelling my body enough, drinking plenty of water and getting an adequate amount of sleep to balance my work and love for fitness! ✨ In terms of my leisure, I keep a diary of dates/times where I’m free to be able to hang out with friends and family! I also set time to create content for the gram to be able to engage with you all ❤️✨ I love my routine and I try to be as motivated as I can to stay on top of it all! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Do you do shifts at work?

user_0;user_0172.jpg;🌿✨ FOOD TIMINGS?!✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ When’s the best time to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner? ✨ There’s no best time eat, however their are times where your body can optimally use the calories/ energy you’ve consumed, especially pre and post workout! ✨ You may of heard of “intermittent fasting” all it is, is an eating window for people that lifestyle suits it! It’s not a fast track to weight loss or anything of the kind! ✨ Fundamentally, however you choose to eat, weight loss and gain is dependent on your overall intake throughout the day! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼Pre workout snack/ meal: Typically you want to have a meal high in carbs to provide the energy you require to be able to push through a workout! If you’re in a rush and you need something quick around 30mins before a workout, simple carbs are your go to! However, if you have time - which I usually make time for it, I’d have a meal/ snack high in complex carbs which is going to provide a slower release of energy maintained throughout the workout!! Fats also provide a long term source of energy, but that’s dependent on how your body facilitates it! Personally, my overall intake for the day is higher in carbs than fat, as my body is able to process carbs better than fat! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉🏼Post workout meal: You want to try and eat within 2 hours post workout to be able to replenish the muscle fibres broken during a workout! A meal high in carbs and protein is essential! During a workout, your body uses up its glycogen stores and results in your muscles being partially depleted of glycogen. Some of the proteins in your muscles also get broken down and damaged. After your workout, your body tries to rebuild its glycogen stores and repair and regrow those muscle proteins. By increasing carbs and protein post workout it helps decrease muscle protein breakdown, Increase muscle protein synthesis, Restore glycogen stores and Enhance recovery.

user_0;user_0176.jpg;🌿✨Fitness update ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ It has been 6 months since I’ve started my “bulk” per say, where I have increased kcals above my total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) into a caloric surplus! ✨ I implemented a technique called reverse dieting, where by every two weeks, I opted to increase my kcals from my caloric deficit by 50kcals! By doing so, it allowed my body’s metabolism to adjust accordingly and in simple terms, not being shocked and not knowing what to do with the extra calories! ✨ Instead, by going slowly, my body adjusted and knew what to do with the extra kcals in correlation to my method of training and progressive overload! ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Disclaimer: every BODY requires different amount of kcals to function, to be able to build and to be able to loose! I’m sharing my stats purely offf of the basis of reference and interest! ✨ currently I’m 2 weeks into a “shreddy” phase! I bulked up to 2100kcals and Im quite happy with the progress I’ve seen, particularly in my upper bod! I’ll also be using reverse dieting to lean out over a 12 week period - which is a sensible and achievable timeline - not a week like “fad diets” claim you can do sustainably!✨ 👉🏼Current weight: 45kg - I don’t weigh myself a lot because I find that it is a useless measurement as my body weight doesn’t really change much! Progression photos always 👏🏼 (I’m 5ft) 👉🏼Current calories: 2050kcals Current workout split: x5 per week, x3 lower bod, x2 upper bod, x3 core 👉🏼Current cardio routine: 1 HIIT session per week 👉🏼Current steps: 15-20k steps per day ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Last year, I found my shreddddy to be quite successful, and I was really happy with what i achieved (BTW, Yess I love to achieve aesthetic goals too! But I’m not obsessed with it, I just enjoy reaching a goal)! This year, I’m not going to go as low as I did previously! I’ll be doing these updates every 2 weeks to check in! I’ll also be doing a YouTube video to further explain the idea of reverse dieting and why it’s so useful! ✨ #fitness #fit #fitnessmotivation #fitnessjourney #DYE #🇬🇧 #😊 #bodybuilding #gym #workout #vegan #plantbased #highprotein ✨🌿

user_0;user_0178.jpg;🌿✨Q&A 2✨ Wearing @doyoueven @doyouevenwomen ✨ new clothing releases coming 19th February ✨ Automated discount link in my bio ✨🌿✨Q1: How are you able to wake up so early to work out? A1: for me, I don’t find working out as a chore! I have a passion for it, and I think when you love something so much, you don’t even think about the difficulties of it! I don’t even find it hard to wake up at 5am, I’m so use to it, as my body alarm clock just wakes up at that time naturally! ✨ I get to sleep early (if my work schedule allows it) and have enough of it, I fuel my bod before I hit a gym sesh and I just get on with my day! It’s just the type of person I am! I like routine and I like structure! However, due to my work schedule, sometimes I’m not able to gym in the morning, so I factor that in and do it after work instead, even though I wayyyy prefer a morning workout! ✨ I’m a shift worker, so not every week is the same, but I find a way to structure each shift pattern to ensure I’m getting enough sleep and training because I love it! ✨Q2: The majority of your meals seem to be sweet like desserts - why not other sources of carbs? A1: I’m definitely a sweeeeet tooth kind of person but I do have normal lunches and dinners too, it’s just my feed is mainly breakfast based! If you’d like to see more of my lunches and dinners, let me know in the comments with “🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️✨ Q3: What helped you changed your mindset towards food to become more healthy? A1: it was a combination of friends and family, as well as other people online who were a positive influence and my personal development also! I’ve always been sooo interested in food, nutrition, health and fitnesss! At the start I was uneducated in terms of nourishing and fuelling my bod , but I kept reading around, as well as through trial and error which has lead to my understanding of a healthy sustainable way of eating! I no longer look for “shortcuts” I just know the fundamentals of being able to maintain, lose or gain weight through my diet without restrictions ✨ ✌🏼 In my next post, I’ll be updating you with my current stats including my body weight, kcals, steps +training split✨ #vegan #fitness #DYE #plantbased #😊 #🇬🇧
user_0;user_0179.jpg;🌿✨ Happy Sunday all! Another breakfast recipe from my ebook! Chocolate chip Chunky Monkey 🍌 Granola with protein milk ✨ the one thing that is taking the most time with my ebook is actually photographing every single recipe! All the recipes have been written up and placed into the ebook, it’s just the photos which are left! ✨ it’s looking like mid March for the release, but I will update you! ✨ Macros: 527kcals 55C 37P 21F✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ On a more serious note, just a little Sunday reminder to be kind! ✨ Build each other’s up instead of ripping each other apart! Yesterday’s news about Caroline flack really made my heart sink! ✨ Although I didn’t know her personally, I could see from her presence on TV how much of a character she was! ✨ It also made me realise that there are people fighting with battles we know nothing about! ✨ So please, think before you release vicious commentary online! ✨ We all have our down days, social media can really affect someone, whether that be someone with a celebrity status “living their best life” or the average joe! ✨ Be kind always ❤️ strive to crack a smile on someone’s face everyday rather than being toxic✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Promise me, you’ll give someone a hug today, open the door for someone, or leave compliment! One of my favourite things to do day to day, is to make someone smile, whether that be online or in my job role, it brings me so much joy but at the same time confuses me why someone wouldn’t want to do anything less than that!✨ #bekind #carolineflack #loveisland #breakfast #vegan #plantbased #veganfood #mealideas #veganrecipes #veganbreakfast #granola #highprotein #chocolatechip #dessert #leilasbreakfast ✨🌿

user_0;user_0181.jpg;🌿✨ When you’re feeling a bit savoury but feeling something sweet aswell... have both!! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Made this chickpea omelet for my ebook bunch of recipes! I stuffed it with sautéed kale, grilled sweet peppers and mushrooms! ✨ But of course, I had to have something sweet to finish off other wise I wouldn’t be satisfied 🙃 so I made some powdered @myproteinuk peanut butter on @lovebakerstreet sourdough toast, chocolate chips and glazed bananas! ✨ I glazed the bananas in the @myproteinuk sugar free syrup and cinnamon in a frying pan for 5 mins until golden! ✨ The great thing about a chickpea omelet is the fact that it’s a great source of plant based protein and carbs, keeping you fuelled for the morning! The peanut butter, banana, chocolate chips and toast all provide a source of fats and carbs aswell! Overall a delicious and nutritious breakie 👅✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ What did you have for breakfast today ??? ✨ #vegan #veganfood #veganbreakfast #breakfast #breakfastfood #plantbased #mealideas #highprotein #chickpeaomlet #food #healthy #highproteinfood #leilasbreakfast ✨🌿
user_0;user_0182.jpg;🌿✨ MY GO TO SNACKS! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨ For me, I need to snack! The time between breakfast and lunch, lunch and dinner is way too long for me not to eat! Typically, I like to have a pre workout snack, breakfast, another snack, lunch with a dessert, another snack and dinner with a dessert! ✨ To be able to have many snacks within the day, I’m allllll about volume so I make use of lower calorie options to be able to have more within the day so I don’t feel hungry for long periods of time during the day!! ✨ The type of snack I have depends on what time of the day I’m eating them, for example, typically my pre workout snack is higher in carbs to be able to fuel my workout and for my body to optimally make use of that macronutrient, where as snacks that I have earlier or later in the day may be higher in protein or fats to keep me satisfied and provide a longer term of energy throughout the day✨my go tos: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Fave protein bars such as: @myvegan carb crusher, @myvegan red berry protein balls, @oatein millionaire shortbread squares, @nugonutritionuk choc pretzel sea salt, @phdnutritionuk toffee popcorn and @misfitshealth chocolate caramel protein bars ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ Chia pudding: typically 15g chia seeds mixed with 15g vanilla soy isolate, some almond milk and toppings ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ Unsweetened soy yogurt pot mixed with either a flavoured protein powder or a flavour drop - my faves are the toffee and white chocolate from @myproteinuk ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4️⃣ Fresh fruit! Such as a banana, mixed berries ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 5️⃣ other faves: rice cakes/ crumpets topped with mashed banana or some kind of spread like @lotusbiscoffuk or @sweetfreedomuk choc shot or PB, @proper popcorn, @guruji_snacks lotus seeds, @soreenhq loaf bars, @livias nugglets, @indiebaysnacks dark chocolate covered pretzels ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ I also like to make my own high protein snacks such as brownies, muffins and cookies which can be found on my YT: Waffleswithleila ❤️✨Let me know what your go to snacks are? ✨ wearing @myproteinuk @officialmp ✨🌿
user_0;user_0183.jpg;🌿✨ That Bop you do out of the gym when you BOSSS a session! ✨ Final set for Q&A from the previous questions asked on my stories!✨ ❤️✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Q1: How many times a week do you recommend for beginners to gain muscle at the gym without being injured? ✨ A1: Typically Injury comes about when you over train! Whether you’re a beginner or not, you shouldn’t be over training or using weights with incorrect form! ✨ How many times you should work out depend on your lifestyle! If you can manage 6 sessions a week that’s great! If you can only manage 3, that’s just as great! You can adapt your training split for it to be the same intensity as those weeks where your workouts are more spread out in a week! Ie. Employ 3 full upper body days to be able to target each muscle group throughout the week! ✨⠀⠀ ✨Q2: How long were you training before you started to see change? A2: I would say it took a good 2-3 years to be able to see the muscle definition and body recomposition come about and for it to be maintained! ✨⠀⠀ ✨Q3: What should you eat in the morning before a workout? A3: whether it be in the morning or whatever time of the day, before a workout, it’s best to have simple carbs which are easily digestible and can supply energy for the period of time that you train for! It all depends on when you you’re having your pre workout/ meal which determines how many kcals you should have before. for example if you’re training in the morning, personally I eat 300-400kcals as a pre workout meal/ snack early, where as if it is later in the day where I’ve already consumed a substantial amount of kcals already I would have around 200-300 kcals as a pre workout snack just as a little pick me up! I don’t take any pre workout, I just use food for fuel and coffee, just not after 10am otherwise I won’t be able to sleep!✨⠀⠀ ✨Q4: How do you regain your period ? During my restricted eating , I lost my period for over a year because I was consuming too low of calories and overtraining in respect to that! To be able to regain your period, I would suggest reverse dieting and actively make an effort to fuel your body! ✨ #fitness #fit #doyoueven #gym #workouts #vegan
user_0;user_0184.jpg;🌿✨If someone tries to take my squat rack....✨ Another set of Q&A from the previous questions asked on my stories!✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Q1: “I’m really insecure about storing fat in my tummy” any tips on how to get rid of it? ✨A1: this is such a common question! If it’s not how to get rid of fat in one area of the bod, it’s “how do I tone” in a certain area of the bod and not the other! Well my friends, truth is, there’s no such thing! If you want to “tone up” it’s an overall loss of fat distributed throughout your body which is highly based on your genetics! However, with a training routine which focuses on all parts of your body, engaging all types of muscle groups, you’d be able to manipulate that! Also fat loss is a progression, it doesn’t happen by performing one ab movement!✨ Targeting and engaging all of your muscles when training is best advised, along with a calorie deficit over a period of time! ✨ ✨Q2: Are you going to bother dropping kcals over summer seeing as you’re already lean? ✨ A2: My vision of lean on my bod would be different to yours! Currently, yes I’m quite lean for the amount of kcals I’m consuming and in terms of how I feel, I feel great! ✨ I may decide to get a little shreddy for my hols, but currently I’m quite content with my physique now! I’m personally not ashamed to say I like to work for aesthetics aswell as feeling great when I’m working out! I love setting a goal and striving towards it! ✨ What I can say is that I won’t be decreasing my kcals as low as I’ve done previously as my metabolism has increased since then! ✨ ✨Q3: Does reverse dieting work? ✨ A3: 1000% yes! It’s a technique I employ when getting shreddy and building, for more info, I made a YouTube video separately about both processes! ✨ ✨Q4: is 2000kcals really the minimum amount of kcals women should be eating per day? ✨A4: In simple terms, no, no one has the same amount of kcals that they should be eating per day! Your kcals are going to be totally different to sally down the road! It’s based on your age, gender, genetics and lifestyle factors! You can workout your kcals according to your goals, on a number of nutritional calculators! ✨
user_0;user_0185.jpg;🌿✨LOWER BOD WORKOUT✨ Wearing @doyoueven @doyouevenwomen seamless leggings! Links in my bio ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Little training update, as you can see from a number of my stories, I log my weight progression in the gym on an app called @trainerize ✨ Seeing as I get many questions about it every time I post it on my stories, I thought I’d let you know how it works! ✨To be able to have the app you need to be invited by a PT! Since January, I decided to join my boyfriends online training program which he uses the @trainerize app for his clients! ✨ it’s so helpful and has really built up my progression in the gym! ✨ @armandocantore offers a personal training program suited for your goals and specific needs and the one he made for me is just fab! 👏🏼 I’m being challenged but I’m also progressing so I love it! This is one of his lower bod workouts I did yesterday morning 👇🏼 ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ BB Hip thrusts 5x5 - explosive dead drops off the ground ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ Leg press 5x10 - High foot position ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ DB RDLS Dropset 3x20 - 10 heavy/10 half the weight ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4️⃣ DB Step ups 3x10 per leg ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 5️⃣ RB weighted Glute bridges x30 SSW/ Glute Abductions ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌿✨ Do you log your weights? Do you use an app or stick to pen and paper? Personally if it was pen and paper, it would get lost 🙃 having it on my phone is just easier, especially if my gym bag changes frequently! ✨ #fitness #workout #fit #healthy #gym #lowerbodyworkout #buttworkout #booty #☺️ #gym #training ✨🌿

user_0;user_0191.jpg;🌿✨ Q&A✨ Hello all! Since my previous question and answer did well, I thought I’d do them more often, and so I’ll be breaking it up into 3 separate posts, 4 questions each from the IGS I put on my story! ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Q1: How often should you take progress pictures/ measure yourself ?✨ Firstly, you should realise that progress should be measured over a long period of time, not just a week! ✨ sustainable and maintainable results don’t happen over night! Therefore, I’d suggest taking monthly progress pictures! ✨ You can pot to use the scale if you want but personally I don’t find it to be a true reflection of your progress! Don’t be obsessed with the scale weight as your weight is dependent on your muscle: fat ratio! Your weight fluctuates, and so the scale doesn’t really account for that!Progression pictures, hip/waist measurements are a better form of measurements! ✨Q2: Do you do 15-20k steps on rest days aswell? What app do you use to track calories?✨ In a video I filmed for my YouTube channel “waffleswithleila” I shared my 2020 goals, one of them being to aim for 15-20k steps per day, I explained that my day to day job is quite active as it is so I usually surpass 10k without even trying! I do them on both rest and training days ✨Q3: How tall are you? How much do you weigh? ✨ Please appreciate my measurements are personal, don’t feel the need to compare yourself to me because it’s not going to help you in any sense, but I’m aware that people like to know for reference! I weigh 44kg and I’m 5ft small .. yes a tiny human! ✨Q4: How long after exercise should you eat? ✨ In a study conducted by some researchers, they measured the eating window that athletes/ bodybuilding competitors and the average joe going to the gym like me, should be eating between! ✨ they found out that it’s important for those training really intensely to get in an adequate amount of protein within the hour of training! However, those that just want to live a healthy lifestyle and all, don’t leave it further than 2 hours! ✨ personally I’m a hungry beast after the gym so I eat the minute I get home! The meal tends be high in protein and carbs to replenish my muscle! ✨

user_0;user_0198.jpg;🌿✨ Q&A✨ yesterday, I asked whether there was anything you wanted me to touch on in a caption as I’m back home ✌🏼 there was a mixed bunch of questions, and so I decided to answer the most relevant ✨🌿 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨Q1: what’s your favourite cheat meal ✨ A1: there’s no such thing a cheat meal for me, I continuously eat foods I love and when I want it! I don’t have any rules when it comes to “good” and “bad” food, I just have an understanding that some foods are more nutritionally dense then others ✨ ✨Q2: On days you burn more kcals, do you eat more or the same kcals ✨ A2: when I have a set amount of kcals that I’ve been following for a while, whether it be a rest day, less or more active days, my kcals won’t change! I personally need the same amount of kcals to be able to recover on rest days and training days considering I train the amount of times I do!✨ I don’t track the amount of kcals I burn, I just track my macros and ensure that I’m giving my body what it needs to suit my training style ✨ ✨Q3: How to get back on track after a weekend away? Do you loose progress ✨ A3: 3-4 days away on a city break, especially when your being active in terms of the amount of walking you’re doing, is not going to do your progress any harm! ✨ Walking is still a form of physical activity ✨ I resume as normally the following day I’m back, Ie. I return to tracking my macros, I go back to my training routine, I ensure I’m drinking plenty of water and fuelling my body in the right way! ✨ it’s inevitable that I would of gained some water weight, but it’s not possible for me to have gained weight from fat from the 3-4 day’s I may of had a surplus of kcals or not ... I wouldn’t know because I didn’t track ✨ ✨Q4: Current training split ✨ A4: training x5 a week, x2 rest days! On the 5 days I train, I incorporate 3 lower bod days and a push and pull session, along with 3 core sessions a week and keeping my step count between 15-20k ✨ Not currently doing HIIT, but as the year goes on and my goals begin to change, so will my training split! ❤️ ✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ 🌿Wearing @bouxavenue black seamless set from the @arabellachi Collab #gifted 🌿

But I can’t lie I can’t wait to just get back to a big bowl of my courgette proats and bowls of veggies ✌🏼✨
