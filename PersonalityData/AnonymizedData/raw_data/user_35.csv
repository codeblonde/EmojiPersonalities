user_35;user_350.jpg;Last day in cape breton 🌊🦋🌾
user_35;user_351.jpg;Which would you pick?! Today I am partnering with Ryvita to show you some fun ways to lighten up your lunch! So happy to be a part of the #fibrefit squad and share these delicious plant-based topping combo ideas. Here we have: 1. thick spread of hummus, chopped cherry tomatoes, nutritional yeast and dried parsley. The hummus adds protein while the tomatoes keep it tasting fresh. 2. mashed avocado, watermelon “tuna”, chopped green onion, sesame seeds and a sprinkle of chili flakes. 3. sliced strawberries, dairy-free cream cheese and a sprinkle of chocolate chips. These crispbreads are a great way to add some more fibre into your diet. I hope you try these out! And let me know below which of these you would reach for first! Head to the blog post linked in my bio to find out how to make them all!

user_35;user_357.jpg;You guys know my love for oat everything so you can imagine how excited I was when I saw that @sodelicious_ca has an oat range! 😍 #Ad So creamy and the oatmeal cookie flavour is amazing! It has chunks of chewy oatmeal cookie dough, brown sugar ripples and an oat beverage base. My idea of the perfect dessert! 😝 #SODeliciousCA #SODelicious

user_35;user_3511.jpg;I am so excited right now because I made a vegan “tuna” poke bowl with WATERMELON 🍉🥰😍! #sponsored Believe it or not watermelon is not JUST a summer fruit, you can enjoy it during non-summer months too and I think this recipe is the perfect way! Watermelon is not only a great texture and colour to substitute for tuna, but marinated in a salty, garlic + ginger marinade, it tastes so great in this bowl! Benefits of using watermelon: it contains vitamin C, it is super hydrating because it is 92% water and there are over 1200 varieties grown around the world! Make sure you check out my blog post for this recipe as well as some fun other ways to use watermelon! 🍉 @watermelonboard

user_35;user_3513.jpg;This past week was eye-opening in so many ways, and without making this about me, I did want to let you know some of the things I have changed and am working on changing going forward. 👉🏼Something I became very aware of is the lack of diversity in what I consume online. Who I follow, what I read, watch and learn from needed a SERIOUS overhaul because it was severely lacking diversity. It’s one of those things that you can’t un-see and I know going forward diversity and inclusion will be at the forefront of my mind in all of these categories, as well as companies I choose to work with in the future. 💕I think everyone, companies and individuals included, are going through a learning and UN-learning period right now so being kind and empathetic can go a long way. Demanding change is important but allowing a bit of time for change to happen is important too. I know that for many people this was (embarrassingly) a huge wake up call and I can feel the shift in awareness already. I’m so hopeful for a future where Black people aren’t afraid to exist in this world, feel like they have just as much of a place as anyone else and feel safe to be themselves. I’ve been thinking of ways to keep the momentum going in your own life beyond just what you’re consuming and a few things that come to mind are: decide you want donations to an organization you believe in for your next birthday instead of gifts. Or plan initiatives in your own city to give back to, and lift up POC and BIPOC-owned businesses (and share online in case you can inspire others to do the same!)💗 The fight isn’t over and the conversation definitely isn’t over. Giving you all a big virtual hug!!
user_35;user_3514.jpg;Popping in to let you know that the business bundle deal is only available for 2 more days and after that every course goes back to regular price (most between $150-$350 each)!!! Some of you have asked if I really think it’s worth it, and my honest answer is YES. 🥰 I bought it myself, and I can whole-heartedly say it really is too good to pass up. If you have EVER contemplated starting a business or if you have a dream of working for yourself, doing what you love and living a life you’re passionate about, these courses will help you do that. The best part is, you have it for life, so even if you aren’t ready NOW but may be in a year or two or three, you’ll still have them. The worst thing would be to miss out now, realize in the future that one of the courses would have been helpful, and then have to pay full price for it, knowing you could have had all 75 for that same price or less😅. If I had the opportunity to get this bundle back when I decided I wanted to work for myself and do my own thing, it would have helped soooo much. 🥺💗 getting all 75 courses for $100usd is the deal of a lifetime so I really hope no one misses out who could benefit! 🤗 ps if you have any questions about the bundle, send me a DM I’ll be happy to answer!
user_35;user_3515.jpg;You may have seen my last post about the business bundle 🥰👌🏼👏🏻 But I wanted to also tell you that this bundle isn’t just for people who have their own business! Here are some of my favourite courses that could be helpful for ANYONE with hobbies, side-hustles or even working an office job! 👉🏼 Beginners DSLR photography 👉🏼 Stand Out and Nail Your Interview 👉🏼 The Debt Course 👉🏼 Set Up Shop on Etsy  Of course if you have a business this bundle has dozens of courses that will truly help you plan, grow, attract new and better clients, make more sales and get a better understanding of how to use the online world to your advantage. Link is in my bio to see the full list of courses and what you’ll learn in each! 🥰If you have any questions about the bundle, drop them below. #businesswoman #onlinecourse
user_35;user_3516.jpg;Today’s the day! My YouTube course has launched BUT I have AMAZING NEWS 😅😍🤗. My course is part of The Business Bundle, a bundle of 75 online courses with topics to help you create, launch, grow, and manage your own business! There is such a diverse range of courses and teachers and this deal is absolutely incredible. For one week only you can get all 75 COURSES for only $100 usd!!! 🤫😍❤️ LINK IN BIO 🤩 Most courses in this bundle cost well over $100 on their own normally, and if you added up all the regular prices of the courses in this bundle, it totals over $18,000 😅. Topics you will find in the bundle include: 👉🏼 All things money (debt, budget planning, finance) 📖 Business foundations (finding your niche, working on your mindset) 💰Making money (creating digital products, how to sell, how to monetize your platforms) 💻 Social media (courses for all platforms including Tik Tok AND LinkedIn! 🙏🏻 Working for others (getting hired, nailing interviews, etc!) 📸 Photography & content creation ✅ Getting leads, marketing & growth 📚 Productivity & balancing workload 💗 Self-care as a business-owner PS. I hope you understand that just because I’m sharing this content it’s not that I don’t care about what’s going on right now. However this bundle opportunity is so amazing I would feel bad if I didn’t mention it. If it helps one person start the business of their dreams and change their life I will be so so happy. Take a look at the link in my bio where you can see a list and description of each course and what you can expect to learn from them!
user_35;user_3517.jpg;Thank you for taking the time to read 💗🌸 love to all!
user_35;user_3518.jpg;Hi Hazel 😍 I’m super excited my Youtube course launches TOMORROW! Now more than ever it is important to USE YOUR VOICE and having a platform to do so is such a blessing. Videos are such a powerful medium and I encourage everyone who wants to share and use their voice for good to do it! After years of experience creating and running my channel, I am finally sharing what I have learned in a course format to help you do it too. 📖⭐️👇🏼 So what will you learn? * gaining confidence & learning how to speak to a camera * how to create stand-out titles and thumbnails so people will click your video * how to plan content * how to film good quality and helpful videos * how to manage the workload * and so much more. 🥰 These are the things that creators who have been around for years have learned through observation and trialling on their own videos. Through making mistakes, learning, and putting in hundreds and thousands of hours perfecting. This course provides you with the no-BS, real deal, practical tips and information that helped me get to where I am today. And now you have the ability to learn it right from your own home with my online course! All the details coming tomorrow 🤓💗🌷
user_35;user_3519.jpg;Art from @domrobxrts 💗 #blackouttuesday Trying to approach this subject can feel daunting when you aren’t educated on it. The best thing you can do right now is learn, discuss, stand up for what is right. Don’t expect people who are hurting to lay out resources for you. SEEK IT OUT. Knowledge is power. As part of the majority, of people who have the privilege of not being discriminated against due to the colour of their skin, it can feel (especially on social media) like you have to prove yourself, to show how “good” you are. Save it, it isn’t about you. What we really need to do is take an honest look at our upbringing, our deep-rooted thoughts and prejudices. Ones you didn’t think up yourself, but absorbed without questioning. No matter how “nice” you think you and your family are, it’s there. You’ll find it. And we need to work on it. Question it. Be HONEST with yourself so you can grow. Educate yourself. Question yourself. Question people older than you who have racial bias because they’re “from an older generation where it was common”. UN-learn. Its uncomfortable. Growth often is. Stand up when you know something is wrong 💗
user_35;user_3520.jpg;Spent the morning in the garden center 🌿💐🌷🌸 Happy Friday!!

I also had no idea it would eventually become my full-time job, allow me to start a business at age 21, do my dream job from home and write a bestselling cookbook 😅🥰 I’ve learned SO MUCH since starting my channel and I finally found a way to share it all with you. From coming up with an idea for your channel, to planning, filming and editing, uploading, monetizing and promoting your videos- this course has it all! I cannot wait to launch on June 1st and see all of you go for your dreams 🌸💫 I also have a special surprise to announce with the course when it launches so make sure you keep an eye out 👀 💗

user_35;user_3530.jpg;Rice is my favourite staple food and I’ve been enjoying it in these meals after at-home workouts!🤗💗 #Ad I have tons of it on hand right now because it keeps for so long in the pantry and can be used for so many different things. U.S.A Rice challenged me to use rice in 5 ways for 5 different days, here are 2 ways I used rice this week: a hearty tofu fried rice and sweet chilli veggie balls over jasmine rice! I plan on making other recipes from the U.S.A Rice website later this week including sweet potato sushi, instant pot wild rice soup and rice and mushroom & sweet potato burgers! Learn how to make these and get the recipes at the link in my bio!🥰 #USARiceCan #ThinkRice #5Days5Ways #RiceisLife #usarice #rice

user_35;user_3534.jpg;I never thought I would be saying the words “virtual Mother’s Day brunch” but since we will #stayhome this year I guess that is the reality! 💗💁🏻‍♀️ my mom LOVES fresh blueberries so we made this recipe inspired by her: homemade granola, maple vanilla hemp milk and fresh berries! Both the granola and hemp milk were made in my Vitamix Ascent A3500! My mom has the same one so I sent her the recipe to make it for our virtual brunch 🥰 Recipes: for the hemp milk, in the Vitamix container, combine 1/2 cup hemp seeds, 2 cups cold filtered water, 1 tbsp maple syrup, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Blend on variable speed 10 until completely smooth, about 1-2 minutes. No need to strain it! Ready to use! For the granola, pulse 1/2 cup almonds and 1/2 cup sunflower seeds in the Vitamix container until chopped into smaller pieces. Add large flake oats and pulse a few more times. Put into a bowl and add 2 tbsp coconut oil, 2 tbsp maple syrup and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Stir well, then pour onto a baking sheet. Bake at 375F for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Allow to cool completely before serving. Enjoy! @VitamixCA #FeedYourLife #VitamixCanada #Partner

user_35;user_3548.jpg;"Vegan sausage & cheese chickpea omelet cups! 🥰@gustafoods has been my go-to for vegan meats and cheeses and I love that they're Canadian! I asked you guys for suggestions on what recipe to make and there were many requests for breakfast recipes so I decided to make these omelet cups with the ""Brunch"" flavour sausage and ""Swisso"" cheese! AND GUSTA is sending one lucky winner 3 packages of Swisso cheese and Brunch sausages! Just like this photo and tag a friend below (Canada only!) I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do!! Ingredients: 1-1/4 cups chickpea flour 2 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon each garlic and onion powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 tsp black pepper 1-1/4 cups water 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup chopped pepper 2 GUSTA Brunch sausages 1/2 cup GUSTA Swisso cheese, shredded Directions: Preheat oven to 375F. Whisk together all dry ingredients. Add water and stir to combine. Add veggies and sausage and stir. Spray muffin cups with oil or use muffin paper liners so they don't stick. Use 1/3 cup of chickpea mixture for each omelet cup. Add cheese to each one, then bake 32-35 minutes. If you try to eat them right out of the oven they will seem mushy inside. Allow to cool at least 15 mins before eating and they will firm up! Enjoy! #ad"

user_35;user_3561.jpg;#VitamixMealPrep! #Partner Today, I am showcasing a delicious plant-based #mealprep all made in my @VitamixCA Ascent A3500. I created 3 recipes that are quick, easy and versatile, so you can save time on cooking and enjoy throughout the week. We have a creamy sun-dried tomato pasta sauce (also great as a spread or even a dip for pita and veggies), garlic sunflower seed dressing (which I use for kale caesar salads, a spread for sandwiches and also a dip for buffalo cauliflower bites) and a fresh juice recipe that has some sneaky greens hidden in it! You can make ALL of them in under 30 minutes. This will save you so much time during the week because you’ll never have to waste time wondering what’s for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Head over to the @VitamixCA Instagram now to get a behind-the-scenes look of how I prepped these recipes to enjoy throughout the week. #FeedYourLife #VitamxCanada #FoodPrep
user_35;user_3562.jpg;Hug your loved ones 🌸 virtual hugs and phone calls count too if you are currently far away from people you care about 🐶
user_35;user_3563.jpg;EDIT: these recipes plus the ones mentioned two days ago are all on the front page of my website now for easy access! ❤️ user_35.com ❤️ You guys loved my last post of some pantry-friendly recipes so here’s 3 more that I think are perfect to make when you are working with non-perishables! I’ve always loved baking and cooking as a way to de-stress so if you’ve been feeling nervous, confined and isolated, maybe baking a batch of cookies or some soft pretzels with your partner or kids could be a nice distraction! Greg and I took up scrabble yesterday and playing that with a glass of baileys & oatmilk honestly was a really wholesome distraction for a while. Okay so all these recipes are on my blog and YouTube! 🥰 in order: almond butter oatmeal cookies, chilli cornbread casserole and soft pretzels! Search on my site or google “Liv b (name of recipe)” to find them ❤️ #vegan
user_35;user_3564.jpg;Sunday mimosas 🥂 there’s two new podcasts available for you to listen to @lifechatswithlivb and @notrashtalkpodcast! Perfect if you’re stuck in your house or laying low this weekend. 🌸 There are still no confirmed cases of the virus in Nova Scotia so we’re still leaving the house occasionally to support businesses and people who have to keep working! How’s everyone doing and feeling?
user_35;user_3565.jpg;With things changing every day, I know everyone is feeling panicked and nervous about covid-19. 😔 I am definitely NOT advocating for panic-buying supplies and food when you already have enough. It’s unnecessary and takes away from people who may need it more. That being said, I put together a few photos of recipes here that use mostly pantry staples (and frozen items) to make! For those of you who may want to make a few meals to freeze, or who may be looking for recipes to use what you have in your pantry, check out these ones! Chilli mac & cheeze (always a favourite, and uses mostly pantry or frozen items!), baked garlic potatoes, pancakes with frozen blueberries and rice noodle stir fry that can easily use frozen veggies if you don’t have a ton of fresh (or can’t find them)! A FEW extra packages of pasta, rice, canned goods like coconut milk and tomato sauce can go a long way! Many of my recipes use these items so if you have them, you’re set! Please remember that panicking generally leads the brain to make sub-par decisions. So remember to take care of yourself, but please do not take things you don’t need because I guarantee other people likely will need it more. ❤️ recipes for all of these are on my blog!
user_35;user_3566.jpg;Willa 🌸🐶 happy Thursday everyone! Recording TWO podcasts today and also doing a big grocery run because it’s one of those weeks that I ran out of everything at the same time.

user_35;user_3570.jpg;Happy International Women’s Day! Today @thebodyshop is celebrating all the hardworking things women do with our hands. 👩🏼‍🎨👷🏻‍♀️👩🏾‍🔬👩🏼‍🌾👩🏻‍🍳 Between recipe testing and filming for my YouTube channel, I cook SO MUCH. It truly is a dream job for me! But, washing my hands as often as I have to when cooking and filming all day to really takes a toll on my skin😅. Which is why I LOVE @thebodyshop Hemp Hard-Working Hand Protector! It’s from their amazing hemp line which hydrates, moisturizes and protects your skin. 🌸There’s also a face mask and shower oil in the line which I love as well! Definitely try them out if you struggle with dry skin or if you just want to give your skin a bit of extra care 🥰 (p.s. I also love that their packaging is recyclable! ♻️) #HandsThatHustle #MyHandsHustle

Anyway this bowl recipe is in my last what I eat in a day video! I’m taking a small break from YouTube (and most of my work actually) right now because I hadn’t taken a vacation or time off in 4 years and I maaaaay have burnt myself out. So I’ve been taking it easy, working on some fun things that don’t feel like “work” and spending a lot of time with the pups.

user_35;user_3580.jpg;Feeling V burnt out lately 😅 decided to take the day off but since I can’t sit around and do nothing (makes me even more stressed 😂) I decided to rearrange the whole bedroom and office by myself! Sometimes changing your surroundings is exactly what you need to find a new flow and feel like things are a bit more exciting 🥰 would you agree?! I can’t be the only one who LIVED for rearranging my bedroom as a kid hahaha

user_35;user_3582.jpg;Let’s talk about BLOATING & DIGESTION 🦋🤞🏻 I have a whole video coming on this soon but I wanted to share a few things here too before it goes live next week🥰 swipe through the photos here to read my tips (they didn’t all fit in a caption) and tag someone who might benefit from these tips! You can also “save” this photo so you can come back to it anytime ❤️
user_35;user_3583.jpg;Last day of our mini winter vacation ❄️🥰 I’m so happy because I went in the hot tub every day and my @kini.tan spray tan still looks SO nice! This is my first spray tan experience (the first one I’ve found that’s vegan and cruelty-free 🐰) and I definitely recommend! I felt very extra getting a spray tan right in my own house (because she comes to you!!) but it was so much fun and so convenient not having to leave my house 😌😂 For those in Halifax you can get $10 off a tan with the code LIV10 🦋
user_35;user_3584.jpg;BROWNIES!!! THE 6 INGREDIENT BROWNIES. Like, THE best brownies that are also vegan, gluten-free and oil-free 😋 No eggs, wheat flour or butter..... so are they even still brownies? HECK YEAH- fudgey, chocolatey, easy to make. I cracked the code guys. Video up now 😍🥰 and they can also be made entirely zero-waste if you have a bulk store!!! In the @notrashtalkpodcast ebook we have a whole section on low and zero-waste recipes but add these brownies to your cooking list too because they totally work! 😌♻️💫
user_35;user_3585.jpg;Trying (struggling) to hold my entire cookbook collection 🥰this is ONLY 17 books!! Really dedicated to showing you guys what an amazing deal getting 90 cookbooks books is... because now my arms are all shaky😅 *take the damn photo greg!!!* Imagine this times like, 5 more stacks. That’s how many books are in the vegan bundle!! Luckily they’re all digital and can be contained in your phone or iPad 😅 cause trust me you wouldn’t want to try and find a place for 90 cookbooks! There’s only a few days left of the relaunch so make sure you get it today or tomorrow because I know the site will be slow again on the last day! If there’s one thing I know it’s that this bundle is worth WAY more than $50. I would have paid that for the 2 books I read in January because they completely changed my life health-wise. I just needed that boost of inspiration to make some healthy changes and just like that I have SO much more energy, better digestion and mental clarity. I really want to make sure no one misses out who might regret it next week, next month or even this time next year! The link to purchase is in my bio and the deal expires forever in 3 days so don’t wait ❤️
user_35;user_3586.jpg;The most fun winter activity I’ve tried - a Nordic spa!! 🥰 can you believe it’s February already?! I swear January usually feels like an eternity and by the end of it you’ve lost inspiration and forgotten all your goals + intentions 😅 BUT a date is just a date and the start of the year may be a good time to refresh your life, however it doesn’t mean that you can’t start again every day if you have to. I thought it would be tough to feel healthier... but cooking more at home, incorporating some new ingredients and starting a yoga practice has completely changed my life and it’s been easier than I expected because I take it one. day. at a time 💫 if you are feeling slightly unmotivated or uninspired stay tuned for my surprise announcement tomorrow (7 am EST!) And in the mean time, pick ONE thing to do TODAY. A yoga tutorial video, a healthy snack, a 5 minute meditation. I PROMISE you’ll feel better after doing one thing for you and not putting it off 🦋
user_35;user_3587.jpg;Two of us were happy about this photo and one was NOT 🥰 thought it would be fun to do a little comments Q&A today so ask us anything!!!
user_35;user_3588.jpg;ALL HOMEMADE 💫 my own crispy “chicken” with creamy cashew kale & peas pasta 🥰 I have been loving cooking SO much lately, focusing on less processed versions of comfort foods while the weather is still cold. Although this isn’t something I’ll eat every day, I notice a big difference eating the more wholesome homemade version than if I bought packaged mock meats or cream sauce. Energy levels are still high, my brain is crystal clear and even though my sleep schedule is thrown off from the puppies I haven’t experienced that super tired feeling in so long. This less processed thing is really working wonders 😌🤍 #vegan
user_35;user_3589.jpg;The countdown is ON! 4 days until our new ebook The Zero-Waste Beginner’s Guide comes out 🥰🤩 I love this book so much. It has ALL the tips you’ll need to start reducing your waste and living more eco-friendly 🦋 plus recipes, lists, guides, how-to’s AND there’s a whole part on how you can still be low-waste when you don’t have access to a bulk store!!! 2020 is the year we need to step it up and make some changes for the planet, but trust me when I say it can be fun and be a “baby steps” thing. You’ll still have a HUGE impact even if you only implement one or two things from this book. With like a million ideas and tips, Katie and I (co-hosts of @notrashtalkpodcast and co-author of the book) make it super accessible and fun to be more zero-waste. You guys are going to LOVE it ❤️❤️❤️
user_35;user_3590.jpg;What’s your favourite “healthier” treat?! My current favs are these pillowy soft oil-free vegan cookies and crispy hemp bars with chocolate 🥰 I made both of these in my new video! On my YouTube channel now. In the quest for some healthier treats (mostly things that don’t involve red dye # 40 and mass amounts of vegan butter 😂) I have found a few recipes that I LOVE! These totally satisfy any sweet tooth and are super fun to make and share with people you love. The hemp bars are from @earthyandy and the cookies are from @tessbegg ebook I got in the vegan bundle! 😌 #vegan
user_35;user_3591.jpg;A Liv B in her natural habitat... in the office editing 🤓 jk my natural habitat is the kitchen but I do spend a fair amount of time in here staring at my face on a screen so that’s fun too... 🤪 I did a panel last week and someone asked “how do you get comfortable in front of a camera?” Honestly, doing it day in, day out. Practice. And more practice. Also editing yourself. I used to pick apart the way I looked or talked every single time, which made editing take soooo long but I realized that after doing it so long, I don’t do that anymore. I also don’t hate the sound of my own voice because I’m so used to it 😅. Long story short I’m glad I didn’t let it hold me back at the beginning!! What’s something holding you back currently from going after your dream?
user_35;user_3592.jpg;When it’s pouring rain and all you can do is make noodles and cuddle your dog 💕 these are just rice noodles cooked with veggies, red curry paste, coconut milk, ginger, garlic and lime juice and honestly SOOO good. Ate the whole plate in like 2 seconds 🥰
user_35;user_3593.jpg;When he says he’ll be your sushi date 🍣🍱🥟🍙 picture that first emoji as sweet potato tho because that’s what we had 😋
user_35;user_3594.jpg;Bought my own house so no one could tell me to keep my feet off the countertops 😂 I spent every Sunday night as a kid sitting on the counter like this while my mom baked cookies, waiting to stir in the chocolate chips and eat some cookie dough 🍪😌 I can only hope I keep that same tradition when I have kids 🥰💫
user_35;user_3595.jpg;My thoughts exactly Hazel 😛
user_35;user_3596.jpg;Less processed, homemade chilli cheese fries 🌱💫 plant-based and life changing!! Recipe in my new video 🥰 LINK IN BIO
user_35;user_3597.jpg;That fresh haircut feeling *swish swish* 💫😌 if you missed it I talked on my stories today about my two weeks of minimizing processed vegan foods and how it’s making me feel. For YEARS now I’ve eaten whatever I wanted in whatever quantity and it healed my relationship with food and myself for sure. 🥰❤️Buuuuut I actually did reach a point two weeks ago where I genuinely was like okay this is too much I actually don’t feel very well 🤪. So in true fashion of listening to my body I started cooking meals from scratch, not filling the freezer with frozen convenience foods and experimented with some new things (gf flours, coconut sugar, lentils, fresh herbs). All in all I am feeling amazing. Anyway, it’s been a revelation and even though I am 100% going to still eat packaged vegan foods, candy etc I have realized that there did come a point when my body said enough, but I was still ignoring those cues (like always being tired despite sleeping 10+ hours lmao) and since trying a less processed way of eating 2 weeks ago everything improved pretty much right away. 🦋🌱 I will never go on a diet I don’t think, but I do believe in changing the way I eat to fit whatever point I am at in life and right now this feels good so here we are. Happy weekend guys! Xo
user_35;user_3598.jpg;Lasagna soup: the ultimate comfort food for lazy people 🥰 you basically put everything in a pot, sit back and watch the magic happen 💫 this recipe has been one of my most popular and most loved YouTube recipes for years (for good reason) and I even put it in my cookbook! Much needed on a day like today❄️
user_35;user_3599.jpg;What a day... got myself a new camera I had been wanting & saving up for and then 20 minutes later got hit with a giant vet bill for Willa’s paw fiasco (if you didn’t see on my story she split it open outside and needed to get surgery/stitches)😂 love when the universe has a sense of humour. 🤪 I did however upload a brand new video on my channel with a whole wheat pancake recipe, following suit of my new low processed focus- which by the way is super fun and I feel SO good, who knew junk food and highly processed food could take such a toll on the body?! Everyone? Okay well I’m late to the party then 😂 in all seriousness though I am having so much fun making homemade versions of all the packaged food I used to buy like pizza dough, cheese, burgers! I gotta credit the vegan bundle for all the amazing recipe inspiration and tips 🥰
user_35;user_35100.jpg;Monday isn’t so bad when it’s spent like this 🦋💫 sauna, steam room, freezing cold ice pools, hot pools, hammocks and cozy robes. Not much more you can ask for in a winter getaway ❄️ @senseaspa
user_35;user_35101.jpg;Three reasons to work out at home: 1. Come January 1st gyms and fitness studios will be packed and that’s no fun for anyone🙃 2. It’s easier to try new exercises and workouts without worrying about what people think💪🏼 3. You can work out in pink velvet shorts and THATS PERFECTLY FINE 😋 Seriously though, waiting for machines at the gym for the foreseeable future sounds like a waste of time and patience. Try @30dayfitness for workouts picked just for you and your personal fitness level. 🧘🏻‍♀️ #ad #30dfchallenge
user_35;user_35102.jpg;Holy flapjacks that’s a big pancake 👀 whole wheat blueberry pancakes with vegan bacon and roasted potatoes 🌱😍 seriously hits the spot when it is freeeeezing outside!
user_35;user_35103.jpg;Vegan lasagna soup for dinner because we’re buried in snow and I want all the warm comfort food I can get 🥰 Some of you may know this if you listen to my podcast, but I took about 2 years to become fully vegan! It started with cutting out red meat and dairy due to digestive issues. And then I slowly started doing research and decided to stop eating all meat, fish, and eggs as well. I didn’t eat many vegetables as a kid, or tons of variety, but always LOVED food. So going vegan opened my eyes to a whole world of amazing, plant-based food. I learned that you can bake cookies without butter or eggs, lasagna without cheese and burgers without meat. 🙉🥳 And somehow I started to love food even more! I eventually started creating and sharing my own recipes, as my passion for delicious vegan food grew. I remember though that when I first started out, most of the food I tried to make was pretty gross, and I felt unsure, at a loss, and confused A LOT. If it weren’t for YouTube & Instagram I would have struggled for so much longer! Luckily some amazing content creators showed me all the tips tricks and hacks to make amazing vegan recipes! 😋 I’m sharing this story because today is the last day to get possibly the BEST deal of the year on 60 vegan ebooks (snag the whole bundle of 60 for $50usd, regularly would sell for $1300). I promise if you are looking to go vegan or maybe are already vegan and feeling lost or uninspired, you need to get the bundle!!! Even after being vegan 5 years I have found so many helpful tips and recipes- but I know that if I had this resource 5 years ago it would have changed my life. I know so many of you feel this way after purchasing and I’m SO happy you are all loving these ebooks. My sauce ebook is in it and trust me when I say these sauces will elevate your food game SO MUCH 🤩🥰 along with the other 59 books you will be set for life! The link to purchase the bundle is in my bio and don’t wait because after tomorrow it’s gone for good! 💫
user_35;user_35104.jpg;My cookbook collection! 📖 I keep them all in my kitchen for easy access. I’m the type of person to collect books and even if I don’t read/use them right away, there’s always times when I get super inspired to flip through and it motivates me to try new things. 🤩🥰 It doesn’t stop here though! My phone/ipad also now has 60(!!!) brand new vegan recipe ebooks and guides from the vegan bundle. I LOVE picking one to scan through while I eat breakfast every morning. And the bundle is only available until tomorrow!! Link in my bio 💫🦋 Start your virtual cookbook collection with me and grab a bundle today for just $50usd. By tomorrow it will be gone forever and you’ll be stuck paying individual prices 🙉
user_35;user_35105.jpg;Holy snow!!! The snow started at 6am and so far there’s no end in sight. Send help, and brownies 😂😭🤪
user_35;user_35106.jpg;New fav snack! 👉🏼 Hummus, vegan cheddar, tomato and cracked pepper on @ryvitacanada crsipbread. 🤗 Perfect little snack before a hike with the puppies! I love that the crispbread is full of fibre and simple enough to be topped with so many different toppings! Sweet or savoury, there are endless combinations to satisfy your cravings while being #fibrefit! 💪🏼 #sponsored
user_35;user_35107.jpg;At the start of every year, I find myself diving into a state of consumption- I always get super motivated to read more, learn more and expand my mind. 💫 Here’s what I’ve been doing lately to take advantage of this feeling: 1. Read 3 pages before bed. Any book, 3 pages a night. Instead of looking at your phone or watching Netflix. I’m currently reading “The Happy Brain” by Dean Burnett. 2. Meditate. I started meditating with the calm app again. 10 mins a day, usually in the evening when I feel like my brain hurts and I’m getting a little anxious. 🦋 3. Switching social media scrolling for learning something new. I downloaded all the books that I am most interested from The Vegan Bundle onto my phone, and now whenever I find myself reaching for my phone to mindlessly scroll, I open an ebook and read. Doing this, I find myself myself looking up from my phone feeling inspired, rather than drained. ✨ Seeing as the bundle contains 60 ebooks, I feel like I’ll have enough to read through for the whole year 🤩 you can still grab one for yourself, it’s only $50 usd which is less than a dollar per book. It’s only available for a couple more days and then won’t happen ever again so check it out through the link in my bio if you want one! 💫 Ps this backsplash behind me is getting replaced tomorrow so this is likely the last photo I’ll be posting with it! I’ve been waiting 8 months for it to be gone- needless to say I’m SO excited! 😌
user_35;user_35108.jpg;Edit: video up now! Head to my YouTube “Liv B”.

user_35;user_35109.jpg;This isn’t an ad for my cool mug but it could be 😋 jk it doesn’t fit in my cup holder and the lid doesn’t completely close so I actually think they could have done better 😂 Greg keeps saying it’s “not a travel mug” so I guess I’ll have to go camping to really understand the hype ⛺️

Happy weekend! 🤗
user_35;user_35123.jpg;Feeling grumpy today so this was the best smile I could do 😂 Usually I try to keep it positive here but you know what? Sometimes you just feel grumpy for a few days for no reason and you just have to surrender to it. Eat some candy, bake some cookies, realize it didn’t really help but just go with it anyway. Sometimes you just have to be a grump and trust that you’ll snap out of it soon 🤷🏻‍♀️

They have 6 grams of fibre per fruit and are a source of vitamins C, K, A, folate, potassium, magnesium and manganese. 🤓 Trust me when I say: you gotta try them! This curry is my new favourite (and approved by family & friends) so I know you will LOVE it! The recipe is on my YouTube channel and linked in my bio. #sponsored @persimoncanada

Obviously tofu isn’t an exact replica of chicken, but it’s a nice meat-free alternative that is better for the planet, better for the chickens and good for you too! 💪🏼 after watching @gamechangersmovie I am re-inspired to show the world how easy and delicious vegan food can be. Emphasis on the EASY because we’re all busy and have places to be!!! So remember this recipe for your next #meatlessmeals ! It’s a good one 🧡 #vegan

user_35;user_35151.jpg;The one organized cupboard in my kitchen right now, although not for long! 😌 Introducing: ⭐️NOVEMBER DECLUTTER CHALLENGE ⭐️ November always seems like kind of an “in between” month to me so I thought this year I would do something to make it a bit more interesting! My good friend @katieeconklin and I are doing a declutter challenge called: #NovemPURGE! 🥰 Here’s how it goes: On November 1st you purge 1 thing. Give away, donate, sell, trash or recycle. Whichever it is- get rid of it!!! Then on November 2nd, you’ll get rid of 2 things. Day 3, 3 things. And so on! By November 30th, you’ll have purged 465 clutter-y or unnecessary possessions. This sounds like a lot but I KNOW you can do it. For example, old dishes, clothes you don’t wear, extra office or school supplies, makeup you’ll never use, and even decor items! Anything that is cluttering your life: say goodbye! As I mentioned, the categories of purging include: donate, give away, recycle, trash and sell. Join us starting November 1st to declutter your house and make sure we can see your progress by using #NovemPURGE🚯♻️👏🏼
user_35;user_35152.jpg;A shot from veg fest 🥰 ☕️ had the best iced coffee (and didn’t forget my travel mug!!) I wish there could be an espresso bar truck everywhere I go 🙈
user_35;user_35153.jpg;Could really go for a steaming bowl of butternut squash soup right now but sadly we need groceries and made one of those “dump a bunch of things into the instant pot” kind of meals for dinner tonight. BUT if you also are feeling like soup, this simple yet delicious recipe is on my YouTube! 🧡 Today started out super stormy and rainy and then all of a sudden got all golden and sunny and felt like the perfect fall day (swipe to see some photos of Haze and our walk). So grateful to live in a place where the leaves change colours (even though I have hours of raking to do in the yard now!). Worth it for the absolute stunning fall photos! Hope you guys had a good day 🥰

user_35;user_35156.jpg;Where I’ve been for the last week.... 🐶 all the way from the rocky mountains, welcome to the fam Hazel!! 🧡 Yes Willa has a new baby sister. Swipe to see what this week has been like. And if you want the WHOLE story of how when and why we brought Hazel home from the west coast, I covered it in my new podcast episode 🙈having two dogs is no joke how do parents have MULTIPLE CHILDREN? My goodness. This little puppy looks permanently grumpy and it kills me 😂 so far Willa seems to love her. Willa is still my baby and I would do anything for her so her happiness is high on our priority list! Luckily she loves having Haze around and is teaching her so much. Anyway, I missed chatting with you guys so have a listen to the new podcast episode for all the updates!

user_35;user_35158.jpg;My whole body is sore but I guess that’s what happens when you plan a trip with “adventure” as the only focus 🏔 I’m a pretty chill, introverted person and I had anxiety for a lot of this trip but pushing yourself to do stuff that scares you sometimes is pretty healthy. Tbh I was more afraid of our long hike than a helicopter ride or wolves 😅 anyway getting on a plane in a few hours and I am quite excited to smell the salty air but I will miss this absolutely incredible view. 🇨🇦🏔 #Canada

user_35;user_35177.jpg;Cheers 🥂 today I filmed a podcast episode with my friend @katieeconklin all about sustainable living/zero waste changes you can make in your everyday life and I am so inspired 🥰 going to do a big clean of the house and start implementing some of the things we discussed. Every little bit counts and after seeing the current destruction of the rainforest and going through a hurricane last week I deeply feel like Mother Nature is really fed up with how much we have been and currently take this planet for granted. Anyway the episode will be up this Sunday 🌎
user_35;user_35178.jpg;Rosé on a Tuesday 💕 if you ever visit Nova Scotia in the summer/fall definitely take a tour down to the valley and hit up all the vineyards. We have so many gorgeous spots! 🥂

user_35;user_35181.jpg;I can’t believe its been 6 months since moving in to my house!🥰 Buying a house was something I wanted to do for a while (especially since I wanted a dog!) but the process was something I knew nothing about. Even though I normally like to do everything myself, I knew that as a first time home buyer, working with a realtor was a good idea. I have some pretty specific requirements for a home since I work and film out of my house, and they were patient in helping me find the perfect place.

user_35;user_35191.jpg;You deserve to move on. ⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ From the relationship that drained you instead of giving you butterflies. That felt more like being their parent than their partner. That you stayed in because you were more scared of being alone.⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ From that friendship that became one-sided. That made you feel annoying and like you had to beg them to hang out. ⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ From the job you dread getting up for every day. That makes you feel anxious and undervalued and like you're wasting time.⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ From the bad memories that keep surfacing and holding you back in the present. From the thoughts that keep you from taking risks. From the mindset that keeps you from pursuing what really excites you. ⁠⠀ You can choose to do the hard thing and be scared but do it anyway and move on with your life. Sometimes I wish I could share my experiences with all of the things I listed above because I have been through every single one first hand. And I know many of you have too. But for today, just know that you deserve to move on from things that aren't good for you anymore.🌸
user_35;user_35192.jpg;My babyyyy 🌸 bringing Willa on vacation was so much fun, our extended family got to meet her and fell in love instantly (as everyone does) 🥰 just look at that smile! Ps don’t worry she didn’t sit like this while we were driving, this was while we were stopped for a little break🌸
user_35;user_35193.jpg;Went for a big family dinner, drank a bright green cocktail, watched people jump off a bridge (it’s an activity they do here, don’t worry🙈) ate fried cauliflower at a seafood restaurant and bought hot sauce at the gift shop 🥰 overall a successful last night on vacation!
user_35;user_35194.jpg;One of my favourite things is creating recipes that make people say “this is vegan?!” 🤩 this photo is from a new little ebook project I’m working on. Any guesses what it is? 🌸☺️ #vegan #recipes
user_35;user_35195.jpg;Swipe to see the unedited photo! 🦋📸 photography has become such a fun creative outlet for me and editing is half the fun!

user_35;user_35196.jpg;Let that shit go. 🌸 remember, not everything that weighs you down is yours to carry. What are you holding on to that you know you should let go of? It’s scary, but I think you should do it. You’ll feel so much lighter when you do 🦋
user_35;user_35197.jpg;I think its time for another little comment section Q&A! 💫 Feel free to ask me anything below and I'll answer all of them throughout the day.
user_35;user_35198.jpg;🦋 today’s podcast episode is all about communication in relationships. What is good communication, how to improve, how to approach tough topics and more! Communication is the basis for a solid relationship and after studying it in university for 4 years I’ve learned a thing or two about how to be a good communicator! You can find the episode on iTunes, Spotify and castbox! 💕
user_35;user_35199.jpg;Happiest by the ocean 🌊 its so crazy how much can change in a year... last summer at this time I was heading to PEI with my family, heartbroken, crying every day, seeing a therapist because I genuinely thought I was never going to feel better, and overall feeling like a shell version of myself for months. Today, Greg and I are going to my family's cottage for the week with our dog and I can't express how grateful I am 🤗 Just goes to show that even when you are at rock bottom feeling like you'll never be happy again, putting yourself first and trusting that you will be okay in time is the best way to make it through. Sometimes it’s hard to want to keep going when it feels like things won’t get better but you have to trust that life will always be beautiful again❤️
