user_13;user_130.jpg;I’ve been working on building some muscle & stamina to get back in shape for ballet 🩰 (bc that’s my happy place which is a necessary part of self-care for me atm). ⠀⠀ If you’re looking for some delicious inspiration I share several brand new recipes in today’s video 🍌🌱// link in bio @user_13 ⠀⠀ I know the world is turned upside down and maybe that’s necessary in order for real change to occur. But we also all have to continue to live, support and take care of ourselves. This video was filmed a few weeks ago so if the timing seems off or you notice I don’t mention current world events, just keep that in mind. More than anything, I hope it brings some joy to your day. . . . #ballet #dancer #ballerina #whatieat #whatdancerseat #plantbased #veganfood #glutenfree #recipe #recipes #dancephotoshoot #dancerlife #ilovedance #instagramfordancers #lifeofadancer
user_13;user_131.jpg;Do you ever say these things to yourself: ⠀⠀ I don’t like my body I’m not pretty enough I’m not smart enough I failed before, I will fail again I should be doing MORE Why can’t I stick to a routine The world is so messed up There’s no point ⠀⠀ There are so many ways to break this pattern but for today, I just want you to focus on one, easy, instant solution.  Go outside, be in nature. ⠀⠀ Too often we are trapped in our heads, trapped indoors, and we just keeping zooming further and further and further into the problem. ⠀⠀ Zoom out. Change your perspective. Turn off wifi and re-connect to Earth. Go on a meditative walk. Put on your favorite playlist. Plan a picnic, listen to the birds sing. ⠀⠀ Get back to now, this moment.

user_13;user_132.jpg;INSTAGRAM ➡️ REALITY ⠀⠀ Loving yourself means always and in ALL ways. ⠀⠀ If you love posing for photoshoots🙋🏼‍♀️📸 (there’s nothing wrong with that if it’s fun for you BUT) you better also be loving your relaxed, makeup-less and unposed self. ⠀⠀ Your body is a beautifully designed vehicle that carries within it your sparkling soul ✨Treat it that way! ⠀⠀ Are you loving yourself enough to: 1. Eat food that makes you feel your best? @freedomfoodlife 2. Move your body daily? 3. Forgive yourself and others for the past? 4.

user_13;user_133.jpg;"How to stop feeling paralyzed by the weight of the world:  Easier said than done, I know. ⠀⠀ As a sensitive soul, do you feel easily triggered and often paralyzed by chaos in the world? ⠀⠀ You know that if you want lasting change be it social justice, or simply creating a happier, healthier more fulfilled life; being overwhelmed will never get you there. ⠀⠀ But HOW can you avoid being soooo deeply affected by your environment? ⠀⠀ CREATE A NEW ONE. ⠀⠀ (It always starts internally) ⠀⠀ Take time for yourself every day to practice these THREE simple habits and notice as you become more centered, grounded and able to take appropriate, effective action: ⠀⠀ 1️⃣ EXPRESS IT Journal. Dance. Sing. Create. Paint. Sweat it out. Whatever it takes to express your feelings so they don’t fester and accumulate to the point of internal combustion 🤯(we’ve all been there). ⠀⠀ 2️⃣ CULTIVATE PATIENCE Change does not happen overnight. Pushing yourself to extremes ALWAYS results in burnout. Catch your impulses and CHOOSE a slower path. One step at a time. ⠀⠀ 3️⃣ TRUST YOUR HIGHER SELF When your mind is running rampant, get in touch with your soul/higher self or higher power. Build a strong connection in this space and you will always get the exact guidance you need to take the next step. ⠀⠀ Did this hit home for you? ⬇️ let me know what you’re struggling with most right now.

user_13;user_134.jpg;I want to reflect on the importance of this last week.  Though tragedy was deeply felt throughout, I also noticed the LOVE and the unity of many different communities coming together, learning, listening and committing themselves to stand with black lives matter for the long haul.  None of this oppression should’ve EVER happened to begin with. It goes against everything this country claims to stand for. “Liberty and Justice for ALL” ?! We are humans. At our core love and connection is what we are made of. Rasicm was built INTO the system to oppress black lives and lift white ones. Even if we were raised by non-rasict, all-loving parents, racism lives in subliminal messaging from the time we are very young. It’s wrong, it’s corrupt, and change must be demanded.  So many of us opened our eyes this past week, for that I am grateful. I am no expert, but I’m committed to learning, growing and standing for black lives, justice and peace. Facing and confronting the hard truths of white privilege and owning up to the actions it takes to push this movement forward. Let’s use this to connect, to be strong, and to stand together.  As I begin re-integrate a portion of focus back into my small business in order to support myself, my family and continue to have a platform where I can speak up, give/donate and share, please know this:  I will stand with BLM now and always. I will keep speaking up and having the hard conversations both online, and in my own family/community. I will continue to learn from black educators and friends. I will support, collaborate with and share black-owned businesses and creators.  I will do my best, and I hope you do too.  #love #unity #wp4bl #justice #cometogether #loveislove

user_13;user_137.jpg;Reposted images from BIPOC accounts: @aleisekay @andrearanaej @rahawahaile I know we are all trying to do our best, and there’s new info every other minute, so when we know better let’s do better. The whole point is to allow a space on this platform for BIPOC voices to be HEARD. We can listen without announcing our silence. We can share and amplify voices without being on mute. But please, whatever you do, do not just disappear. Don’t use this as an excuse to stop having the hard conversations, to stop looking inwards at what you can do to deepen your understanding and truly support the cause LONG TERM.  I’m sharing pages to follow, BIPOC voices and people to support in my stories. If you have any references please DM me. I’m in a constant state of self-education right now. #blackouttuesday
user_13;user_138.jpg;We have to wake up and realize we are all humans and the oppression against BIPOC in America is SICKENING. If you don’t understand any of this, or you want to know what you can do, I speak up about it and share resources on my story highlight ➡️ “✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿” so please take a minute from your scrolling to watch it.  If you are white, PLEASE USE YOUR VOICE. I know you might feel uncomfortable, you might not know what to say or how to say it and you’ll likely at some point say it “wrong”. But we can’t stay silent.  I am guilty of not understanding my privilege, when I was younger I use to push back and say things like “I didn’t grow up with money, my mom and dad weren’t together, I was raised mostly by a single parent, I wasn’t ‘given’ a hand out”... I now realized that I missed the mark. Understanding your privilege is NOT what I was raised with or without, it is NOT that I didn’t struggle, it’s about the fact that the color of my skin wasn’t a part of those struggles.  Black people should not have to face this at all, and they absolutely can not face it alone.  If you’re afraid to speak out because you’re worried about backlash, what people will say... Or maybe you have a social media following/business and you’re worried about loosing followers, I want you to really think about which side of history you want to be on. #blacklivesmatter ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 . artwork by @_emmartist video credit @wealth on tiktok . . #justiceforahmaud #justiceforgeorgefloyd #taketheknee #whiteprivilege #whitepeopleforblacklives
user_13;user_139.jpg;This is the outcome everyone is secretly hoping for right? 🤞🏼😏 Let’s just make this super clear, HAVING FUN IS FREE THERAPY.  If you can’t remember something fun you did the last 24 hours, it’s been too long!  Think back to being a kid, all you ever wanted to do is have fun right? Go to the park, hang out with friends, have sleepovers, swing on the swings, play dress-up, learn new dances (*clears throat* my go-to was nsync music videos 😂)... and then we get older and something weird happens⬇️ WE FORGET HOW TO HAVE FUN!  So here’s my challenge for you: Try for the next week to not get *SO* serious about every little thing. Do your best to incorporate at least ONE super fun activity everyday! If you share about it tag me @user_13 cause I’d love to get inspired by what you find fun!  P.S. yes, I’m 31 and I made a tiktok.. it’s fun so I’m 100% #notsorry 🙃 . . . #tiktok #indoorlooks #outfit #ootd #lazyoutfit #sweats #havefun #fun #funchallenge #healthcoach #plantbased #dancer #ballerina
user_13;user_1310.jpg;Being an empath is hard 😣 ⠀⠀ You’re sensitive, you feel the emotions of others, you’re easily stressed and you burn out quickly. ⠀⠀ Who feels me? 🙋🏼‍♀️ ⠀⠀ But...It’s also A GIFT if you nurture it and take care of yourself properly 💓 ⠀⠀ The GOOD news: ⠀⠀ Your intuition is magic 🧚🏻‍♂️ ⠀⠀ You’re able to truly help people 💓 ⠀⠀ Your ability to manifest is heightened ✨ ⠀⠀ These are all SPECIAL gifts that you have and can use to create an extremely beautiful, peaceful and fulfilling life... ⠀⠀ THE PROBLEM IS If you don’t first fill your own cup, you’re constantly running on empty. ⠀⠀ I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME. ⠀⠀ THE SOLUTION: Targeted empath self care 🧘🏼‍♀️⬇️ ⠀⠀ 1. You NEED time alone to clear out negative thoughts, feelings and energies that are NOT yours. Mistaking other people’s sh*t as your own is classic for empaths. ⠀⠀ 2. CHOOSE your friends wisely. The people you spend time with and surround yourself with significantly impact how you feel and the kind of life you live. Make sure you befriend/date people who are bright, self-contained and have self growth as a priority. ⠀⠀ 3. Just like everyone else, you need to form and maintain daily healthy habits. What you do, eat, watch, read, look at, listen to and think about ALL matter. You’re a precious, sensitive soul. Make sure you treat yourself this way. 🥑🍌🍓✨🌈🌻🦋🧘🏼‍♀️ ⠀⠀ If you want to start right away, I have a FREE self love ebook as well as cookbooks I’ve created that are filled with delicious plant-based and gluten-free recipes for health and self care // links are in my bio @user_13 . . . . #health #selfcare #empath #sensitivesoul #mentalhealth #empathic #veganfood #plantbased #healthy #heal #selflove #dancer #ballerina #queer #ocean #nature #infj
user_13;user_1311.jpg;"You were NEVER lost... .  You just forgot who you were. ⠀⠀ To my younger self and to YOU; No matter how much darkness you’ve experienced, no matter how many mental, emotional, or physical struggles you’ve had - you CAN make it back to the light 💡 ⠀⠀ “But how?.. Some days it feels impossible... It feels like I’ve always felt this way and like I’m going to feel this way forever...” ⠀⠀ THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: ⠀⠀ 1️⃣ DO NOT LET FEAR WIN. Put your big girl spiritual warrior panties on and say NO, I don’t allow those toxic thought patterns, they aren’t my true self. You gotta get in the drivers seat, you’re so much stronger than you realize. ⠀⠀ 2️⃣You ARE the light, it can’t ever be taken away from you. You’re more than a body, more than the thoughts in your head. You are a beautiful, bright soul. And when you remember who you truly are, the light shines through and the darkness fades away. ⠀⠀ 3️⃣ PATIENCE. To embody your healthy self you must heal-thy-self. Healing is not linear and it doesn’t happen overnight. EVERYTHING matters, what you eat, your sleep patters, your daily habits, how often your move your body, who you surround yourself with, what you do with your time, what you watch, read, listen to, think about... Its all connected. Start where you are, do what you can, and learn to love yourself through the process. It’s a journey, but it’s worth it and if I can do you, so can you. 💕 ⠀⠀ Tag someone who needs to hear this.

user_13;user_1323.jpg;When you don’t know what the F to do with your life 🙄.... . . Think back to being a kid 💭 What brought you joy🦋?

Homemade meals, long baths, self pampering, yoga, meditation, read a book, sing, funny movies, call a friend etc. Journal how you feel this day compared to others. Commit to your peace, your serenity, your joy. Do whatever it takes to get there no matter what’s going on around you. ⠀⠀ Your true nature (higher self, or whatever you chose to call it) is calm, loving, centered and compassionate. The eye of the storm is always still. Let this be your mantra today. Share it with someone who needs to heat it.

user_13;user_1358.jpg;"2000 - 2020 ; A 20 year reflection 📝 ⠀⠀ Dear 11 year old Katie, I know you just want to be accepted by kids at school (which you’ll laugh at in the future btw 😂) but I need you to see how special you are RIGHT NOW. You may not make the best decisions in the next few years (spoiler alert 🚨 you make some pretty awful ones actually) but it’s ok, and it all eventually works out I promise. For now, soak up these moments; that first kiss on the cheek that makes you swear you’re seeing fireworks. The first time your crush gives you a hug in the hallway and you think your face is going to explode from blushing so hard. Sleepover parties with your best friends where you play dress up and choreograph awful dances to Backstreet Boys and N*sync. Singing Christina Aguilera’s “Reflection” at the TOP of your lungs. Still feeling like a kid on Christmas morning. The excitement of playing truth or dare. Passing origami folded notes in class. Life without constant technology (just trust me 🙄). These moments are all just a part of your regular everyday world right now, but you can never get them back. All I ask is that you savor it. Cry, sing, laugh, dance, play dress up and mostly know this; being “cool” isn’t all it’s worked up to be, just be YOU & don’t be afraid to shine. Some people won’t like it but shine anyway baby girl. ⠀⠀ Love, 31 year old Kate"

user_13;user_1361.jpg;"In my body, I am FREE. ⠀⠀ Today I uploaded a video discussing my eating disorder journey. It hasn’t been something I’ve shared a lot about on my platforms especially not recently, so it felt vulnerable to upload. For those of you who can relate, I truly hope it helps in some way. And even if you can’t relate, thank you for listening; like you always do 🙏🏻💗 ⠀⠀ Find it on YouTube: Kate Flowers 🌸 ⠀⠀ #eatingdisorder #recovery #health #love #vegan #plantbased #mentalhealth #edrecovery #beforeandafter #dancer #ballet #ballerina #bikini #model #bathingsuit #beach #freedom"
user_13;user_1362.jpg;*sensitive content* As women, we are all faced with body image challenges. And as a ballet dancer, model or athlete, those challenges are even more pressing. For many years I battled with disordered eating, most of which took place over a decade ago. I was young, a full time ballerina and had no idea how to maintain a healthy diet or a healthy mindset. ⠀⠀ While my mental and physical health have DRASTICALLY improved, I recently had a wake up call while reading “Overcoming Emotional Eating” which was written by a psychologist and is one of the 60 ebooks in the bundle I’ve shared about. It has opened my eyes even more to the full spectrum of emotional and disordered eating. While I have healed immensely since I was a young girl in high school, I certainly have faced obsession with “clean” eating (especially when I first got into the “high carb, high fruit, low fat” movement) as well as emotional/binge eating which I struggled with and talked about within this last year. ⠀⠀ Healing is not linear. And whether or not we want to believe it we are ALL healing from something. I want to be a voice that says ITS OKAY and YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL no matter what. But while my voice may help, it’s probably not enough. ⠀⠀ The truth is, we all need education, support and guidance. This is what I love about the “Overcoming Emotional Eating” ebook. She offers a step-by-step process with an accompanying workbook to help you identify and work through the triggers that cause you to over-eat or under-eat emotionally. ⠀⠀ I genuinely believe this ebook could be life changing for anyone who has struggled with any of the above issues. I’m so honored to be able to share this self-love, informational, educational and plant-based recipe packed ebook bundle. There’s only 6 days left to get all 60 ebooks, including “Overcoming Emotional Eating” for $50. I want YOU to benefit from this, to learn to love yourself more, to take care of your body, mind spirit and emotions. The new year is here, it’s time. Go to bit.ly/katebundle or click the link in my bio @user_13 to have instant access, from any device, to these incredible ebooks. ⠀⠀ Remember, your body is your HOME. Love it.
user_13;user_1363.jpg;Let’s talk HONESTLY about 2019... It wasn’t as pretty as my Instagram feed makes it out to be. ⠀⠀ I will START with the good news, the highlight reel... 1. I attended a magical ball with my love, we laughed and danced all night. (filmed a winter glow up GRWM video for fun! Link in bio if interested @user_13) 2. I moved into a much cozier house that feels like home where we had a very sweet holiday 🎄🏠 3. Launched another @freedomfoodlife cookbook with @mae.inlove AND got the ebooks made into PRINTED copies (an accomplishment I wasn’t sure I’d ever meet). 4. Traveled somewhere new and fell in love with Europe where Marty got to meet his biological father, and family, for the first time! (pretty incredible)  Now for the stuff you don’t always see, the NON-highlight reel: 1. Marty’s Mother passed away at the young age of 47. 2. A decent portion of the year I struggled with terrible anxiety and depression which led to emotional eating, social anxiety, and hardly ever leaving my apt. 3. I barely danced or performed at all, even though that’s pretty much my only life goal. 4. I cried and wanted to QUIT youtube and social media more times than I can count.... 5. My heart broke when I said goodbye to my cats. (they went to live with their other mama). ⠀⠀ Life is not always perfect or pretty. It’s messy, it’s hard, it can be sad and there’s more lessons to learn than you could’ve ever wished for. BUT within all of that there’s always room to be grateful, as hard as it may be at times. Please don’t ever feel inadequate compared to another persons highlight reel on social media. We are all human, we all struggle and go through things but most of us are trying our best to learn to fill our own cups with self love and hope that it spills over into the lives of others. ⠀⠀ It’s okay to look back at 2019 with mixed feelings. It’s also okay to be excited about 2020 and a fresh start all the while knowing that it won’t be perfect 💗🙏🏻
user_13;user_1364.jpg;"I always like to reflect back this time of year. Our memories, stories, and the people we chose to spend our time with, truly shape our lives. I’ve always been a lover of tradition. To me, a repetitive yearly ritual feels warm and comforting; nostalgic and enchanting ✨ (photo descriptions from left to right swipe ➡️) In 2018 @roosaare and I spent our first Christmas together as a couple. We also went to the annual Nutcracker Ball that the company he works for puts on every year (which also happens to be the FIRST photo I shared of us together AND my most liked photo to date 😱🥰). I threw the extra photo in because I always love decorating the tree, but last year I wrapped myself up in Xmas lights and ornaments for a fun photoshoot. (It’s important to remember to have FUN as adults during the holidays)🤪🎅🏻I’m excited to repeat some of my old traditions, the ones I’ve just started with Marty last year, and to create new ones ✨ What are your favorite holiday traditions?? 🎄 Mine include: ✨Opening presents on Christmas morning in PJS ✨Making tea, coffee and vegan bagels 🥯 for breakfast ✨Watching (at least one) of our favorite Xmas movies ✨Reading something out loud together that is meaningful to us ✨Donating to my favorite charities ✨Hot chocolate, good food and lots of relaxing, laughing and focusing on gratitude🙏🏻 MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄 HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!

user_13;user_1386.jpg;You must love in such a way that the other person feels f r e e.
user_13;user_1387.jpg;Dear 16 year old Kate, ⠀⠀ I am so sorry. I know this is your lowest point. You are concealing how much you’re suffering. You are hiding the drug use from some of your closest friends and family because you don’t want to hurt them. I know you feel lost, alone and trapped... I know you hate yourself for this cocaine addicted world that you’re currently in. I know most days you wish you weren’t alive... Your light has gone out and the darkness has started to consume you... You’ve forgotten who you really are. ⠀⠀ But I’m here now & I need you to hear this: Yes, this is your lowest, darkest point. Even when you’re 30 it’ll still have been your lowest point - things only go up once you get through this...and you WILL get through this. ⠀⠀ But here’s the truth, quitting will be hard, recovery will be even harder and it will take a very very long time. BE PATIENT. You will still feel sadness and regret every day for giving up on your dreams to do ballet.. but eventually, you will get back into it and it will feel so f***ing good. YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOURSELF. You will heal from this, slowly. But you will also learn SO much. There will always be ups and downs and you still have many rough days ahead but you are going to meet amazing people and fall in love so many more times than you think. You will reconnect with your spirit and soul in ways you didn’t even know you could. I know it seems impossible right now but EVERYTHING will eventually make sense, I promise. And most importantly, you will LIVE and you will be happy and grateful to be alive. ⠀⠀ And by the way... I forgive you. In fact, I am grateful for every mistake and every low moment you had to endure, it helped me remember who I really am.... we’re gonna make it. I love you.  More posts like this can be found on the @freedomfoodlife page. I was also re-inspired lately by @juliealedbetter to do an updated post like this because it’s been a while 🙏🏻💗
user_13;user_1388.jpg;WHAT HAVE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF DOING THAT YOU GAVE UP ON?  for inspiration on this topic, check out my latest video on YouTube- link in bio @user_13 I poured some serious love into that video & this photo was taken as soon as I got done filming it, I was happy 😊  P.S. swipe right for the #bts of what taking a photo at home using self timer actually looks like 😂
user_13;user_1389.jpg;Why I feel like a FRAUD. ⠀⠀ old pic ➡️ new pic ➡️ #bts new pic ->final version ended up as a low quality iPhone pic.. Back to why I feel like a FRAUD:  1️⃣ I still call myself a “dancer”, I even take dance photos, yet I am not consistently, actively dancing. Which first off makes me sad bc I love dance more than anything but also makes me feel like a poser 🙁(although project comeback IS in motion!!!) 2️⃣ I preach about the importance of health but I often go a whole day forgetting to drink even ONE glass of water 💦 🙄 3️⃣ I KNOW physical activity is vital for physical and (evenly more importantly) MENTAL health, yet getting into a solid routine has been a challenge for me. 4️⃣ Similarly, I am aware that cultivating relationships and positive social interaction is a part of a healthy, balanced life.. (I’m working on it) but the truth is I went an entire year mostly secluded in my apartment (I may talk about this one more in an upcoming video) ⠀⠀ I think you get the point. I AM HUMAN. And for some reason I truly thrive when I feel like I’m helping others. Helping you, helps me. So let’s do this together! ⠀⠀ Comment below which one you feel you need the most help/support with right now: 1️⃣ healthy eating 2️⃣ physical activity 3️⃣ more social interaction 4️⃣ passion/creative outlet
user_13;user_1390.jpg;birth place: earth race: human politics: freedom religion: love ⠀⠀ It was so cool seeing these street art quotes all over Oslo, Norway. Every single one inspired me (swipe right to see the others in case you missed them the first time around)
user_13;user_1391.jpg;If today was your last day on earth what would you do with it?  LOVE MORE. Give more. Worry less. Smile at strangers. Help others. Feel the sun on your face. Spread as much joy as possible. Apologize. Forgive. Dance. Sing. Say how you feel. Feel the fear and do it anyway. LIVE, truly live... with intention, passion and presence. ⠀⠀ Of course if we all knew it was our last day, we would treat it differently. But why not just live every like this? At least to some degree. ⠀⠀ All it really means is having more gratitude and appreciation for what already IS. ⠀⠀ Let’s remind each other of this often. The more we live to our fullest potential, the happier more loving world we can co-create 🌎
user_13;user_1392.jpg;Whatever you’re struggling with, you are not alone. ⠀⠀ We’ve built this beautiful, loving, supportive community together and it’s been an honor for me to help facilitate that. ⠀⠀ Let’s continue to grow and be there for each other. Comment below with something you’re dealing with today that’s challenging for you and let’s all pitch in to lift each other up. ⠀⠀ I’ll start 👇🏻
user_13;user_1393.jpg;To watch us dance is to hear our hearts speak.
user_13;user_1394.jpg;Even just 5 minutes alone, in silence, with a cup of tea can be therapeutic ☕️ ⠀⠀ How much time do you dedicate to yourself every day? Uninterrupted, self-care, YOU time. ⠀⠀ I’m guessing the answer is either none, or not enough... am I right? ⠀⠀ I feel you, I’ve been there, and still sometimes find myself going one too many consecutive days without it. ⠀⠀ If you’re feeling overwhelmed, overworked, stressed, anxious or just plain crappy - THIS IS A SIGN. Your body is telling you “I can’t take anymore.” Please, listen. ⠀⠀ Take a break, a step back, or even a few minutes alone each day. Slow your mind, center yourself, drink more water, nourish your body, B R E A T H E. ⠀⠀ If yoga or a guided meditation will help, do it. ⠀⠀ If you need to hire a sitter, take a day off work or cancel your plans to give yourself a spa day every now and then, do it. ⠀⠀ Whatever it is that makes you feel calm, at peace and loved, do it. Life is too precious to be spent on high-speed stress mode all the time. ⠀⠀ YOU deserve this and the people you love deserve YOU at your best. ⠀⠀ Make a promise to yourself that you will find (AT least) 5 minutes today to re-center yourself. Set the intention and make it happen. One day at time 🙏🏻
user_13;user_1395.jpg;Every year I’m in awe of this magical, unexplainable feeling between summer and autumn ☀️🍂 ⠀⠀ Something about embracing the change that is inevitably coming makes me feel... free. ⠀⠀ The smell of the air, those first few leaves 🍁 that change color, and the nostalgia of being a kid and having that scary/exciting FIRST day of school each year. ⠀⠀ Do you feel it too?
user_13;user_1396.jpg;☀️IM PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE CREATED☀️ Making these ebooks with @mae.inlove for @freedomfoodlife took a TON of work but was so so much fun and seeing your love and enjoyment of the recipes + meal plans makes it all so worth it! ⠀⠀ Thank you to everyone who’s supported us 🙏🏻(Check out the reviews on my site if you’re curious what people are saying)  Cheers to health + feeling our best! Have a great weekend everyone! ☺️
user_13;user_1397.jpg;THE AMAZON RAINFOREST HAS BEEN BURNING FOR WEEKS WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL NEWS COVERAGE. ⠀⠀ What does this mean?! To put it lightly 🔥 Our LUNGS are on fire. ⠀⠀ The amazon rainforest: • produces 20% of the AIR we BREATHE • makes up 40% of the worlds tropical forests • holds 20% of the worlds fresh water supply ⠀⠀ Praying is not enough we have to take ACTION. THIS BEAUTIFUL PLANET IS OUR HOME. ⠀⠀ What can you do? 1. Educate yourself. Learn about what’s going on. I know it’s devastating but awareness matters. 2. Speak up. This isn’t hitting mainstream news so it’s up to us to be the voices that share this info. Like, share, repost, add to your story or tag your friends. 3. Make conscious food choices. Factory farming must end, food production is the leading cause of deforestation. Shop LOCAL as often as possible, but mainly WHOLE foods, say NO to anything containing palm oil, and move towards a plant-based diet. 4. Support the cause by finding organizations to donate to if you can.

user_13;user_1398.jpg;"I don’t care if you’re gay, straight, bi, pans, trans, queer, fluid, unlabeled or anything in between; I love you. ⠀⠀ In today’s video @roosaare and I talk openly about our sexuality and how we both identify. ⠀⠀ Check it out on my YouTube channel: Kate Flowers"
user_13;user_1399.jpg;I can hardly believe this is real ✧ ⠀⠀ ...my life used to be drastically different. ⠀⠀ A lot of you have heard parts of my story on YouTube or read about it on @freedomfoodlife but hear me out today... ⠀⠀ In my late teens I became heavily involved in drug use. Along with this came a severe amount of self neglect, numbness, depression, anxiety, guilt and shame. ⠀⠀ Even after I quit the heavy stuff, I felt purposeless for a long time. I had little motivation for life and my idea of love was kind of twisted. I certainly had none of it for myself. ⠀⠀ I ruined my dreams of doing ballet professionally (which up until then was the ONLY thing I cared about). But I also lost touch with with my soul, my spirit, my authentic self and my innocence. ⠀⠀ While this story is indeed sad, I’m not here for your sympathy. ⠀⠀ I MADE A CHOICE TO HEAL. ⠀⠀ And it took a really f***ing long time to get where I am today. ⠀⠀ Looking at this photo hit home for me. I see someone who is free, who knows love for herself and others, who appreciates the earth, nature and the beauty of life. I see a girl that has reconnected with her inner child and that precious spark of innocence, play and laughter. And I see a woman who has been through hell and back but who never ever gave up and now gets to travel and share a positive message with others. ⠀⠀ I’m still a work in progress, we all are. I still dream of dancing on stage again and I’m working towards making that a reality. But for now, I am happy and more than anything I am grateful- for all of it. ⠀⠀ I can’t express how deeply my heart it touched that you are here, listening to my story and sharing this moment with me. Thank you. I hope what you take from this is that no matter what you’re going through, you can heal, you can LIVE again. Love is the soul of life, it is ALWAYS there, you just have to remember to connect to it ✨
user_13;user_13100.jpg;Everyday is a new beginning ⛅️ Take a deep breath, smile and start again.  btw I am reading a book called “essentialism” by greg mckeown. for anyone who is mentally scattered, super busy but not efficiently productive, or just generally feeling overwhelmed and over-worked- I highly recommend it. been a life saver for me ☺️
user_13;user_13101.jpg;Your life is a blank canvas, You are the artist. ⠀⠀ It’s never to late to start over, to re-define yourself and to create the life you truly desire. ⠀⠀ This is one of my all time favorite quotes by @yung_pueblo : ⠀⠀ “True power is living the realization that you are your own healer, hero and leader.” ⠀⠀ Let’s INSPIRE each other today. Leave your favorite inspirational or self-empowering quote in the comments 👇🏻
user_13;user_13102.jpg;SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT REAL LIFE. ⠀⠀ While I love using it as a form of art and expression, I think it’s important for all creators to acknowledge this fact.  weight gain + real talk: ⠀⠀ Today I uploaded a vulnerable video to my channel about the weight I gained over the winter...(not pictured in this photo so please don’t leave a comment assuming that I think this photo is a reflection of weight gain, it is NOT). ⠀⠀ Here are some things I want you to know: 1. First, please watch the video for the full story... YT: Kate Flowers 2. I love myself and my body no matter what. 3. It’s okay to gain weight, you should honor and love your precious body regardless of weight, size or any other external circumstance. What matters MOST is that you feel happy (unfortunately for me the weight gain occurred during a not so happy mindset/time and therefore I didn’t feel my best because I was struggling in general) 4. It’s important to remember that what you see online is a TINY fraction of someone’s reality. ⠀⠀ Posing for a photo can make us look worlds different than we do in real life. And that’s okay too! Photoshoots for me are so much fun! HOWEVER, we don’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes of a photo, or anything else posted on social media- SO STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHERS. ⠀⠀ Gaining inspiration in the people you follow is GREAT but if that turns into a comparison game, it can be toxic. ⠀⠀ I will always do my best to be a voice of reason on these platforms. I am so grateful to every single one of you who are here with me. ⠀⠀ Love, Kate

user_13;user_13107.jpg;A letter to you, ⠀⠀ I see you, I know you’re there. ⠀⠀ Even if you’re a silent viewer and we have never spoken or you’ve never left a comment or sent a DM, I want to thank you. ⠀⠀ After a while it’s easy to become numb to the numbers on the screen (follows, likes, views, subs). And to forget that every single number = a real human being. ⠀⠀ In fact sometimes I feel that even I am not seen as a real human being (trolls + hate comments are mind boggling to me because I could NEVER imagine doing such a thing to ANYONE even if I disagreed with their opinions entirely). ⠀⠀ But if you all magically appeared as a live audience in front of me, I would be in complete shock, amazement and honor. ⠀⠀ You have enabled me to live a life with a voice loud enough to reach many people across the world. ⠀⠀ I am grateful for every viewer, silent or not, every YouTube watch, Instagram double tap, ebook download, apparel purchase, insta story view, comment, and DM. ⠀⠀ From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here. Your presence has changed my life forever. ⠀⠀ With Love, Kate  #love #grateful #health #dancer #ballet #travel #photography

user_13;user_13110.jpg;DARE TO LIVE ✨ ⠀⠀ Traveling has expanded my vision to see beauty of this world. It has also taught me that this beauty can be found anywhere. You don’t have to cross an ocean to appreciate life, to explore and to find hidden gems. ⠀⠀ REAL TALK:⠀⠀ For the last couple years I’ve been somewhat isolated. Have you noticed a lot of youtubers mention that they don’t leave their house often? Well, at least some of the ones I watch have mentioned it. I found this to be true for myself too... It was only when I went so far from home that I realized how insanely unhealthy it was to be such a hermit. ⠀⠀ I’ve definitely grown to be more introverted as I’ve gotten older but damn, I was really mostly living within the walls of my apartment for the last year and it did a number on my mental health. ⠀⠀ Although I’ll still being posting travel pics for a while, since being back home I’ve gone out every day and explored the city I live in (& plan to keep this habit as much as possible because frankly, it helps, a lot.) ⠀⠀ There truly is magic everywhere, you’ve just got to open your eyes ✨ ⠀⠀ #travel #explore #magic #mentalhealth #vegan #plantbased #dancer #travelgirl #estonia #live #inspiration #motivation #love #bi #queer #loveislove #inlove

user_13;user_13118.jpg;Can we talk about the food in Europe?! 🌱 ⠀⠀ I’m trying to save some content for the vlogs but DANG everything has been sooo delicious 🤤 ! ⠀⠀ We have had no issues finding plant-based meals, cafes, restaurants and items at the grocery stores. ⠀⠀ If you’re ever in Oslo I highly recommend @osloraw ⠀⠀ It’s definitely been my favorite spot so far and I’m lucky we are going back to Norway once more before we return to the states.

user_13;user_13120.jpg;an evening cup of tea ☕️ with a view of this never ending summer sunset [photo taken at 11pm] ⠀⠀ I definitely did not expect this but I quickly learned that in certain parts of the country the sun never truly sets in summer. It was an adjustment the first few nights along with the jet lag because everything in me wanted to stay awake all night and enjoy the dim light of the early morning hours. ⠀⠀ What a beautiful time of the year to experience in Norway. ⠀⠀ I can already say this trip is a life enhancing magical experience and I am so grateful for all of it. ⠀⠀ And of course very much looking forward to sharing the vlogs with you from these gorgeous days 🙏🏻

user_13;user_13124.jpg;Low carb vegan meals... Impossible? No. Challenging?

user_13;user_13125.jpg;Happy Birthday my love @roosaare ⠀⠀ Today we celebrate you. ⠀⠀ So here are just a few of the many things I admire about who you are: ⠀⠀ You never take a moment for granted. You’re constantly striving to grow, to learn and to be better than you were the day before - in all areas of life. Your passion and love for ballet inspire me every single day. You listen deeply and think before you speak. You are patient, kind, forgiving and compassionate. ⠀⠀ This world is lucky to have you. and so am I. I love you. Happy Birthday.
user_13;user_13126.jpg;Wake up wrapped in a daydream ✨ ⠀⠀ The most important part of my day is the first couple hours after waking. ⠀⠀ I spend that time consciously working on being calm, centered, peaceful and positive. ⠀⠀ 9 times out of 10 it makes a gigantic difference in the kind of day that I have. ⠀⠀ If you wake up and are flooded with stress and anxiety and the first thing you do is reach for your phone for some good old numb out scrolling on social media, I feel you. ⠀⠀ I used to spend every morning scrolling before I even got out of bed. ⠀⠀ Breaking that habit has been one of the best things I’ve ever done. ⠀⠀ It allowed me to start to CHOOSE the kinds of thoughts and feeling I have in the morning and re-direct my attention from my phone to my internal reality. ⠀⠀ The things we daydream about (aka think about and FEEL) are what create our life. ⠀⠀ I decided to start a routine where I wake up and chose to focus on breathing, slowing down and imagining the kind of day, week and LIFE that I want to live. ⠀⠀ Check out my newest video to see my full anxiety-free morning routine ✨ YouTube: Kate Flowers  #daydream #dream #morning #goodmorning #morningroutine #health #healthyhabits #mentalhealth #plantbased #girl #photoshop #ethereal

user_13;user_13128.jpg;Chose to see through the eyes of L O V E ⠀⠀ We all struggle (sometimes a lot) and there’s already heaps and of negativity bombarding us daily through the news, media, our own minds, other people’s problems etc.  All you can do is chose love.  Forgive yourself first and foremost. If you’re having a hard day, don’t beat yourself up for it. Accept it, take care of yourself and know that the feeling won’t last forever. If the news & media has you down, find something you can focus on that you feel love and gratitude for - it can be anything! If it’s a person in your life who’s projecting their icky feelings onto you, realize that what they are feeling is THIER issue, not yours, and that they must be in a pretty dark place to be taking it out on you. Try to find compassion in your heart, think of something about them that you DO love or admire, focus on that and then recognize when it’s healthy for you to walk away from the situation.  We aren’t victims to negativity. Life can been seen as a beautiful, precious gift if we allow it to, the choice is always yours 🙏🏻

I know I often “complain” about how being on social media is a challenge but when I remember moments like this, and the creation of something that came from so much love on all our parts- it’s ALL worth it.

user_13;user_13135.jpg;No one is you, and THAT is your super power 🧝🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♂️✨🌸 ⠀⠀ Yesterday I posted a video on YouTube that I was strangely nervous to post. It took courage for me to speak up and share how I really feel about some of the online bullying situations that have been happening on YouTube between vegans, ex-vegans & just in general between people. The feedback I received was WAY more supportive than I could’ve ever imagined. I spoke more strongly and passionately in that video than maybe ever before and it was well-received and understood. It’s an incredible feeling to BE YOURSELF, speak your truth and be heard. So THANK YOU, all of you. I wouldn’t be here doing any of this if it wasn’t for you. 🙏🏻💗 ⠀
user_13;user_13136.jpg;L O V E H E A L S ⠀⠀ I don’t mean this in some kind of vague, airy fairy way. I genuinely believe that love and unity can change the world. Romantic love is amazing and I am so grateful to have such an incredible connection with this beautiful soul @roosaare. But more importantly BIG LOVE, unconditional love, love that sees beyond a difference in lifestyles, opinions, and political or religious views. The kind of love that arises in humans at the moment of a crisis or accident. When people come together to help someone who fell on the sidewalk or rush to the site of a car collision to make sure everyone is okay. In those moments we aren’t asking who they voted for, whether or not they are vegan, what their spiritual beliefs are... we just show up because ultimately we don’t want anyone to suffer. ⠀⠀ That nature, that instinct is within us. Love is where we come from, love is who we are. It doesn’t mean we will all agree on everything, WE WONT. And that’s okay. Allow people to be who they are, to believe what they believe and have a big enough heart to LOVE THEM ANYWAY.  THIS is the only way I can imagine things will improve. There’s A LOT of f***ed up stuff happening in the world today.. if you focus too much on it you’ll be overwhelmed and won’t know where to start, how to help, what to do in order to make a difference. But if you start with love, you can’t go wrong. ⠀⠀
user_13;user_13137.jpg;Today we honor our Mothers, we wouldn’t be here without them. ⠀⠀ @amoriyahflowers you are AMAZING.

user_13;user_13138.jpg;"Ever since I was a little girl I have loved to perform. All the home videos from my childhood involve me wearing dress up clothes, dancing in the living room, using flowers as props, posing myself in front of the mirror, and “putting on a show.” Some people might call this “fake.” But to me, it’s all I’ve ever known and it’s what comes naturally to me. We must stop trying to become somebody we are not. Every one of us is unique and gifted in our own beautiful kind of way. For me that means dancing, modeling, singing, performing, acting, doing art, activism, coaching, and spreading as much love to as many people as I can... if you haven’t found your voice yet; think about what you loved doing as a child. Our innocence and intuition will guide us if we let it 💖"

user_13;user_13140.jpg;THE TRUTH ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA: I think by now most of you reading this know that no public figure shares 100% of their life online. You see a very small fraction of someone’s reality based on what they chose to share on social media. While I think following people for motivation, inspiration and even entertainment can be extremely positive and beneficial - it’s important to remember that WE ARE HUMAN TOO. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how I can be even more real, vulnerable, and transparent with you all. Here’s a start: Some days I question why I’m doing any of this. I’m probably a workaholic. I stress almost every single week about what new video I’m going to film but once I start I usually love the process. I overthink, a lot. I enjoy time in nature away from the internet more than just about anything. The longer I’m online the less I want to talk openly about certain things for fear of being misunderstood. I feel safer on Instagram because YouTube trolls are real. There’s about 6-7 days every month where the stars align, my hormones are perfect and I feel like I’m on top of the world.. I watch mostly motivational videos and informative documentaries on topics that I find important. I also binge watch meaningless Netflix series because who doesn’t? I miss full time dancing every day and sometimes have thoughts that I “gave up on my dream” ... again. I want more than anything to inspire people to live from a place of LOVE, self-empowerment, deep awareness, passion and purpose. I sometimes forget that I don’t have to be perfect in order to do that.. ⠀⠀ So there, that’s a start. Never compare yourself to someone you see online. Everyone is doing their best but also fighting their own battles. I will always do my best to remain as authentic as I can through these screens. Thank you for being here, thank you for reading this very long post. If you can relate, leave some love in the comments. ⠀⠀
user_13;user_13141.jpg;Peace is not found in the calm before the storm. Peace is found in the calm within, during the storm. . . the last few weeks have been a lot.. major life changes taking place, the release of our new book, realizing that I am currently living in a place that I don’t feel is home.. my only goal throughout this has been to remain as calm and centered as possible, which doesn’t always happen. I am not perfect, I struggle, but I never get stuck in it... I’m choosing to follow my heart and surrender to the process even if it’s not happening exactly the way I’d hoped.. watch today’s new youtube video for all the life updates... youtube: kate flowers ⠀⠀

user_13;user_13145.jpg;Thankful for this human 💏 Check out a day in the life with my love up on my YouTube channel now: Kate Flowers 🌸 ✧ @roosaare you’re so patient and kind even on my crazy, anxiety ridden, PMS over-the-top kind of days.

user_13;user_13146.jpg;No one has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold 💗 ⠀⠀ Sometimes my heart feels like it’s going to explode. Every single day I think about how I can help more people and do better for the planet and the environment. I am so passionate about spreading health and joy that somedays it’s overwhelming. More than ANYTHING I am truly an empathic, sensitive soul who can’t bear seeing other suffer. All I’ve ever wanted to do is make an impact on someone’s life. I LOVE encouraging others to lead a life of self empowerment, fulfillment and peace. This (along with all forms of art and performance) is what makes my heart feel most expansive and alive. What fills your heart most? ⠀⠀
user_13;user_13147.jpg;Be a warrior not a worrier. ✧ It does NOT matter what anyone else thinks of you. So long as you are following your heart, staying true to yourself and living up to your own standards and potential. THAT is what will make this world a better place. What are you doing today to become the strongest, healthiest, most fulfilled and loving version of yourself that you can be? Forget what “they” are doing, focus on YOU. Be your own hero. 💪🏻🧝🏻‍♀️ ⠀
user_13;user_13148.jpg;still here 🍎🌱 #vegan ⠀⠀ Regarding the current vegan youtube drama: Does it make me feel sad? Yes. I am sad that some people may be influenced by these waves of changes in the online vegan community and swayed away from maintaining a vegan lifestyle. I am sad to hear that anyone has been suffering with health issues, vegan or not, because I think we all deserve to feel healthy and happy. Do I think that’s possible to do as a vegan? YES. I feel sad that there’s so much hate being thrown around. While I understand the frustration and confusion, like I said in the video I made about this topic a couple weeks ago, hatefulness is still not the answer. PERSONALLY, I’m vegan for ethical reasons first and foremost 🐷🐣🐠🐮 If I am experiencing any health issues I will do everything in my power to fix those issues within the realm of veganism. I try my VERY best to only share a responsible, nutrient dense, safe vegan diet and message. Because it DOES take responsibility. A vegan diet CAN be really healthy but just like with nearly any diet, you must educate yourself about nutrition, calories and possible deficiencies. If you are under eating for long periods of time you will likely experience some decline in your health. If you aren’t tracking your nutrients (at least in the beginning) you run the risk of not eating enough of the right foods to meet all of your nutrition requirements and over time it can really affect your body, health and hormones. Having said all of that, i am not a perfect person. I do not have all the answers.. What I do know is that I care about the planet we all currently call home 🌍 I believe that fish belong in the ocean, that animals inherently want to live and that all beings deserve to be treated with love and respect... Do YOUR best. Keep your values strong. Try not to judge others (even when it’s hard) and just BE a shinning example of what you believe in 🙏🏻💕 ⠀⠀ p.s. totally unrelated but to all the other dancers out there who noticed- what is going on with that left pinky?! 😂

user_13;user_13150.jpg;"I feel the happiest when there is peace in my heart. Happiness doesn’t come from outside of us. No person, place or thing can bring us joy if we aren’t grounded in our own self love. For me this means; loving myself enough to eat healthy, to calm myself down when I’m stressed or anxious, to BE THERE for myself the way I am there for the people I love. We so easily give love to others, help them when they’re feeling down - how could we not give that to ourselves as well? 🙏🏻 Having peace within is my priority. I let go go of the need for approval from others and accept myself just as I am here and now 💕 What can you do today that will bring you a sense of peace and self love? 👇🏻 (p.s. for those of you who’ve been asking for it, I finally filmed a full hair care routine 🧝🏻‍♀️ you can find it on my YouTube channel: Kate Flowers) ⠀⠀"

New video is up now on my YouTube channel all about my thoughts on being bi, sexuality and labels.

user_13;user_13152.jpg;I feel at home when I am closer to nature 🌳 This truth is becoming more and more apparent to me. I crave time in nature. It’s when I feel most calm, centered, peaceful and happy. ✧ I normally would try to be a perfectionist only posting a photo on Instagram that was well thought out, somewhat planned and taken on my nice camera. This isn’t because I’m “selling out” it’s simply because I also love ART. However, sometimes the unplanned, candid moments captured on my i phone are the realest and most authentic. This was one of them. ✧ I was on a short vacation in Florida this weekend, basking in the sun, breathing in the ocean air and catching breezy moments in the shade of the trees. I was present, living in the moment and filled with love, joy and life. ✧ ⠀⠀ The truth is I grew up in a concrete jungle. Walking the streets of NYC as a kid, almost never having a backyard or significant time in nature. It wasn’t “bad” I just didn’t know any different. I always considered myself a “city girl” because for many years it’s what felt like home. It was familiar - I understood life that way. It’s only been in the last few years that I’ve truly discovered my deep love for nature and the connection I feel when I spend time amongst the elements. ✧ I am so grateful for this realization, it’s allowing me to choose the direction I’m headed in. What kind of life I want to live. Where I want to be and what’s most important to me. NATURE, PEACE, STABILITY, CREATIVITY, LOVE. Who can relate ? 🙏🏻
user_13;user_13153.jpg;Love is the substance of life. Everything is connected in love, absolutely everything 💕 I had an amazing Valentine’s Day but more importantly I’m working to make EVERY day a celebration of love. WE choose our focus each day, every moment. And what could be more significant than focusing on love? What we love to do, who we love to spend our time with, places we love, things we love - all of it! This world (and particularly the internet and the “news”) tend to be over saturated with judgement, fear and drama. We have GOT to move against that current in the direction of truth, love, kindness and compassion. It starts with you... what can you do today, right now to focus on the feeling of LOVE ? 💕 ⠀⠀

user_13;user_13157.jpg;Your health is in your hands 🌱 New what I eat in a day video now up on my YouTube channel: Kate Flowers ✧ No one is going to do it for you. You’ve got to take responsibility for your life and your mental, emotional, spiritual and physical health 💪🏻 This is the only way I’ve ever felt self empowered and fulfilled. There are hundreds of “influencers” who will tell you there’s only ONE way to be truly healthy (I’ve been in that trap as well when I believed that super high carb, low fat was the answer - and I’ve learned since then that for me, it’s NOT.) Ultimately you have to find what works for YOU ✨ And most importantly you must be sure to meet all of your nutritional needs within whatever diet you chose 🥦🍓🥕🍉🥥🍠🥑 I do my best to be a responsible “influencer” but I am still a work in progress and learn more and more about what my own body requires over time with trial and error. I have never preached that my way is the only way. I try to always encourage that you pay attention to nutrients within the food you eat because I believe that without that you can fall into major deficiency if you’re not careful. So while I’m extremely excited for everyone who decides to go plant based, I definitely want to talk more about how I personally stay healthy eating this way so that it might help others out there who are struggling. Again, I don’t have all the answers and my hope is that you are always guided by your own intuition regardless of the people you follow online. Thank you for being here and being interested in what I have to share, I am extremely grateful for your continued support 🌷 let me know if you like the new video and it’s more “casual/relaxed” approach. 👇🏻
user_13;user_13158.jpg;“If we surrendered to earth’s intelligence we could rise up rooted, like trees.” ✧ This week has been intense. If you’ve followed my Instagram stories you already know what’s going on. From a magical vacation in Florida to hearing the news that my partner lost his mother and flying back home for the funeral. There aren’t many words you can give to someone when they lose a parent at the young age of 47. I have done my best to be supportive and loving throughout this time while trying to balance the daily demands of life and running my business. I feel immense gratitude having two healthy parents that I love so dearly... To anyone else who has gone through something like this , I hope you allow yourself the time to grieve, to process and to ultimately stay strong and continue to love yourself and those around you. To live with purpose - to focus each day on what you are grateful for and always continue to grow. All we can ever do is become the best version of ourselves. Rooted like trees and rising like stars. ✧ ⠀⠀ photo taken by my dad, I love you top quote: Rainer Maria Rilke ⠀⠀

user_13;user_13160.jpg;A true candid moment captured 🌊 I can’t express the level of happiness I feel being here and getting to show my love this magical place 🌅 Suddenly I am re-inspired to be my healthiest and most authentic self. It amazes me that a single place on earth can do that to a person. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a city or country that you deeply feel is where you belong? ⠀⠀
user_13;user_13161.jpg;I’ve been thinking a lot about 2018 and all the changes this year brought. The lessons I’ve learned and how every ounce of pain I’ve felt has brought 10x the amount of growth. That’s the magic of being human. We G R O W through what we go through. I think more than anything I’ve come to accept myself more than ever this year. I realized deeply that I AM ENOUGH and that only from that place can I transform into more of my most authentic self. What has your biggest lesson been this year? Your favorite moment?

user_13;user_13169.jpg;Don’t be pushed around by the fears in your head. Be led by the dreams in your heart. ✧ I have been feeling stuck in my head lately. Anxious thoughts, lots of “not good enoughs” and comparing myself to others. Anyone out there experience this?! 🙋🏼‍♀️ When I hear myself in those mind patterns I quickly snap myself out of it by re-affirming what I know IS true. I am doing my best, I CAN slow down and be present in THIS moment. All it takes is a few deep conscious breaths, noticing the sounds, smells or scenery around me and feeling me feet on the ground. Always come back to NOW. Thinking about the past or worrying about the future takes away from a fulfilling and happy life. It means that you’re never here, in the moment. And that is the place where your heart and soul will shine through, everything makes sense and your mind is at peace. ⠀
user_13;user_13170.jpg;Life isn’t about FINDING yourself it’s about CREATING the version of YOU that feels most authentic.

user_13;user_13173.jpg;“I totally regret eating healthy today” - said no one ever ✧ The truth is, when we eat better we FEEL better. And isn’t that what everyone wants ? To feel better? The transition to a healthier lifestyle might not be easy - junk food can be extremely addictive - but it’s WORTH it! All you have to do is START somewhere. At the very least incorporate one meal a day of healthy, whole, plant based foods. If you want to take it up a notch drink more water, add more fruit, greens, veggies, healthy fats and plant protein to your meals. Most importantly make sure these new, healthier meals taste GOOD to you! None of it will be sustainable if you’re not enjoying your food 🌱 Comment below your favorite healthy meal that also leaves you feeling great! ✧ vegan shoes: @koifootwear

user_13;user_13179.jpg;We all have two sides. One we let the world see. And one we don’t. I am NOT perfect. I have (many) bad days where I struggle and am filled with anxiety. I mostly show the world the side that’s happy, positive and motivated because that is the message I want to spread and that I believe in deeply. But the days when I struggle, I tend to keep quiet. I don’t want to be seen as someone who complains about their life. Because my life is great. I have endless things to be grateful for and I focus on those things EVERY DAY no matter what. It’s hard to be vulnerable, it’s challenging to share real emotions. I just want to say thank you to every one who can relate. Thank you for existing. Thank you for never giving up on yourself. Through good days and bad days, at least we have this community and we know we are not alone. ♥️ (feel free to comment about your “two sides”) ⠀⠀
user_13;user_13180.jpg;I don’t have all the answers. But I do know this: 1. If you’re not doing what you LOVE, you’ll never be fulfilled. 2. If you’re not treating yourself with love, kindness and compassion you’ll never feel “good enough”... 3. If you don’t eat a healthy diet, move your body and take time to calm your mind you probably wont ever have the energy or motivation for 1 & 2. So stop waiting for the “perfect” time to start. No such thing exists. All any of us ever have is right now, in this moment today. So go fill up a glass of water and get hydrated, make that green smoothie as a late night snack instead of the bar of chocolate, take a 20 min walk tonight, spend 5 min meditating and slowing down that constant mind chatter. Do the things that you KNOW will feel good even if it’s not what you “want” to do. Extraordinary lives aren’t built by laying around, eating junk and watching Netflix. You have to put the work in to achieve the results you desire. I’m not saying it’s easy, I’m just saying it’s worth it.

I do the best I can with each breath I have. Staying positive and grateful as often as possible. Making the most of the precious moments here on earth. Everyone struggles. You are not alone. But I believe in you and deep in my heart I feel that everyone deserves love and happiness. The only truth I know for sure is that if you are looking for those things outside yourself, you will never be truly satisfied. So dig deep, fight your inner battles, heal from your past.

user_13;user_13192.jpg;Last days of summer in the new city I call home ☁️ I have never felt truly at home in just one spot. I have moved countless times in my life and will probably continue to do until I feel like I’ve found my place. In the meantime, I want to TRAVEL 🌍 Embarrassing fact: Despite moving from city to city I have NEVER left the US! I’m turning 30 this year and my goal is to visit at least 2 counties! I can’t wait to share my travels with you - finding vegan food in new places and seeing sites I’ve never seen before. Where should I go first?!?

Which means less environmental damage, less cruelty to animals, and more healthy people. A happier planet overall 🌍 So although this eBook isn’t as “healthy” as the others I’ve created, it has a purpose. To satisfy the taste buds of people who arent used to healthy food or vegan food. Those are the people who could try a recipe from this book and think “If vegan food tastes this good, I can get down with that” i find that the best way to convince people that the vegan life is amazing- is through their taste buds (then all the other info after 😉) I know I cant change the world single-handedly but together, we can ♥️🌱🙏🏻
user_13;user_13194.jpg;O H A N A ♥️ @maefruitflowers this year has been full of laughter and challenges alike. After our public breakup we remained best friends who live and work together.

There will be over 100 pages of content including why to go vegan, eating vegan at restaurants and on the go, all the recourses you need to get started and tons more info! Plus 30 cooked comfort food recipes to satisfy your taste buds as you transition. I see this as the first step toward a vegan lifestyle. It can also be used by current vegans who love bomb food or who want recipes to make for family and friends you’re hoping to bring closer to a vegan life! I find that convincing people through their taste buds is the most progressive way you can make a lasting impact. My passion for veganism isn’t something I often discuss but it is always at the forefront of what I chose to create and share with the world. I love this planet and all the precious creatures that inhabit it. So let’s create a cruelty free world together. Be the change, go vegan 🌱 🐷🐮🐣🐟🐓🌍 Make sure you’re following my instagram stories for the official launch of this ebook at midnight EST on September 15th (so kinda like “Friday” night 😉) ⠀
