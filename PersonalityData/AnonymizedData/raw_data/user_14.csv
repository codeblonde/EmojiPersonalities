user_14;user_142.jpg;Shame on you @marksandspencer 😤 Last year @staywildswim released the designs you can see in the first image. And now? @marksandspencer released the blatant copies you can see in the other photos. THIS IS NOT OK. You cannot take the designs of our small, sustainable and ethical business and turn them into mass fast fashion 😫 @natalieglaze and I are a mix of heartbroken and fuming - but we feel helpless in the face of a huge brand like @marksandspencer. PLEASE share this post, comment below, tag them and let’s hold them accountable 😫🙏🏼 #staywildswim #smallbusiness #marksandspencer @marksandspencerfashionpr

user_14;user_144.jpg;5 Accessible Sustainable Swaps 🌍 ad The guys over at @symproveyourlife have challenged me to share 5 simple swaps we can all make that are lockdown friendly and when done collectively, will add up to a huge impact 🙏 1️⃣ Eat more plants. Simply halving your meat consumption and replacing it with plants can reduce your diets carbon footprint by 40%. 2️⃣ Choose a sustainable bank. Switch to a bank provider which invests your money ethically i.e. not in fossil fuels or factory farming, and ask your pension provider to move your savings to an ethical fund. 3️⃣ Reduce single use. Single use items, especially plastic, use a lot of resources and are often unrecyclable. Instead, opt for reusable items where possible. 4️⃣ Shop secondhand. Whether its clothing, technology or furniture - giving an item a second life helps reduce waste and reduce the strain on resources. 5️⃣ Switch to green energy. There are great providers who provide 100% renewable energy and are often cheaper than fossil fuel based suppliers. ➡️ I am proud to work with a brand like @symproveyourlife who are taking positive steps such as installing solar panels at their production facility and implementing a zero waste system with their grains. So many of you guys have asked for a discount code so here you go: ZANNA15 gets 15% off the 12 week program for new customers in the month of June ❤️ #symproveyourlife #sustainableswaps #consciousliving #consciousconsumer #sustainability
user_14;user_145.jpg;Homemade Ice Lollies 🤩🌱 ad Tag someone who needs to make these 🙌🏼 The sun is making a return so I wanted to share a super simple, 4 ingredient & wholesome plant based ice lolly recipe for you guys 🥰 ➡️ Whisk together 400ml of coconut milk (from a can), 1 scoop of @vivolife açai blueberry protein powder and 1 tbsp of maple syrup. ➡️ Plop some raspberries into your ice lolly moulds and then pour over the mixture. Place your ice lolly stick into the liquid (the raspberries help keep it in place) and freeze overnight. ➡️ The next day there is the option to melt dark chocolate and drizzle this over the top then put them in the freezer for another hour 👌🏼 ➡️ Enjoy 😋🙌🏼 [ad - I’m an ambassador for @vivolife vegan and carbon neutral supplements.

user_14;user_1410.jpg;This week I feel like I’ve woken up. I’ve realised the extent of my ignorance and I’ve started to take action. There isn’t a quick solution to the issue of white privilege and systemic racism. We have to embark on a life long journey of learning, self-reflection, growth and pushing for change. There is a lot of work to be done, much of it offline. In fact what we do when nobody is watching is perhaps the most important. The introspection, the uncomfortable conversations, the reading, the learning, the discussions with our employers/employees, the purchases we make from black businesses and the changes we make to our own. And every single one of us has to do it. I’m ready to start this journey and I hope you are too 🙏🏼 Black lives matter ❤️
user_14;user_1411.jpg;There will be no environmental justice until we can combat social justice issues together 🌎 . To the many of you follow me for hiking & outdoor content, or if you’re just someone who enjoys getting out in nature - this post is for you 🙏🏼 . This week I’ve been thinking: we say “the outdoors are for all”, but are they really? For white people the outdoors often means being on trails surrounded by people who look like you, being represented in outdoor industry media and enjoying nature carefree. . For black people going outdoors can be dangerous. Walking down the street can mean being killed by a police officer. Going birdwatching can lead to a racial abuse. . Enjoying nature without fear for your life is a privilege. If you have that privilege, like I do, I ask you to join me on a journey of education and action. Without equality there is little hope for an effective collective movement against climate change. If you care about the planet, you need to care about it’s people too 🙏🏼 . Here are some incredible black outdoor creators: @_lassosafroworld @she_colorsnature @wildginaa @jujumil @browngirl_outdoorworld @badgal_brooky @flying_tortuga @themirnavator @brandihikes @sandi.oluoch @rongriswell @_tronlives_ Reading & resources are linked in my BLM highlight 💙

It’s time to say it not only with our words but with our actions. We need to do more, I need to do more. I understand that I’ll never understand, however I stand with you.

user_14;user_1417.jpg;Guys... I just ran a HALF FRICKIN MARATHON!!! 😱🏃🏼‍♀️🔥 For years I’ve told myself that I’m not a runner, that I can’t run and that I’m not built to run. If you follow my stories you will know that lockdown has made me challenge those beliefs and push myself well and truly out my comfort zone. Over the course of the past two months I’ve gone from doing a cheeky 5km once a week to running my first ever half marathon and feeling STRONG while I did it! It’s a mental game as much as a physical one and I’m SO proud of how far both my body and mind have come 🙏🏼🙌🏼 So let this be a reminder: You are capable of so much more than you think.

user_14;user_1420.jpg;3 Reasons To Move Your Bod This Week 💪🏻 ad We all know exercise is vital to build physical fitness and resilience, but did you know about these benefits? (I've written a more in depth article about this, available over on the @symproveyourlife website! 🤓): 1️⃣ Gut health. Research suggests that exercise improves digestion, reduces the risk of constipation, boosts levels of healthy microbes in the gut and eases gut issues. Get moving and your microbiome will thank you! 2️⃣ Brain power. Exercise supports blood flow to the brain, boost levels of brain-derived protein and helps to prevent the degeneration of the hippocampus - all essential for learning, decision making and memory. Plus exercise supports your mood and reduces stress levels, double win. 3️⃣ Sleep. Regular exercise increases the quality and duration of our sleep, especially when done consistently over time. And who doesn't want a good nights kip? ➡️ Have you noticed any of these benefits through regular exercise? Let me know in the comments! I am so happy that the science shows exercise has a role in supporting gut health, as I am always on the hunt for more positive ways to support it - which is why I take my @symproveyourlife every single morning ❤️ #symproveyourlife #symprove #guthealth #exercise #homeworkouts #moveyourbody #selfcare

I used 4 large cubes. ➡️ Blend blend blend. Then blend again, until it becomes a mountain of slushy crushed coffee deliciousness. ➡️ Either drink straight from the blender cup or pour into a glass to serve.

user_14;user_1438.jpg;Is anyone else appreciating the outdoors more than ever? 🌿 I am currently #stayinghome to protect the community and our healthcare system, and I encourage you to do the same. However, right now our government still allows us to go outdoors once per day and honestly, that daily excursion is often the highlight of my whole day! Never before have I been so present in nature, absorbing every second I get outside my house and feeling so much gratitude for the little bit of green space at my local park🙏Personally, it makes me want to protect our home even more than ever. Already our planet is thanking us for slowing down, with reduced air pollution and CO2 emissions. But I have been taking it a step further and supporting this positive change by picking up three pieces of trash on my walk each day. You guys know I am a big fan of picking up litter and I would love to encourage you guys to do the same (using gloves or appropriate hand washing/hygiene). If every person who followed me picked up three pieces today, collectively we could remove over ONE MILLION pieces of rubbish from the natural environment in a single day! 🤗 I am so happy to be partnering with  @lovebeautyandplanetuki on this post, a brand who align with my values and consciously encourage their customers to commit #smallactsoflove and engage with local clean ups.

user_14;user_1440.jpg;ad Let’s be real, we are in the midst of a global pandemic and it is a challenging time for us all. Right now it is super important that we #stayhome and do everything we can to support those around us, especially those who are more vulnerable by following government guidelines and practicing good hygiene. That being said, with this extra time on our hands we can let our minds wander to where we might like to go on an adventure once this comes to pass. Personally, I am dreaming about returning to the mountains, what about you? 🌍 You guys know that the majority of my work is done on-the-go (even if on-the-go right now is from my desk to my sofa!). So on my recent trip to New Zealand I was constantly squeezing in what I call “laptop time” around our adventures! 🙌🏼 While I’m on the move I love using the @HPeurope Elite Dragonfly - a laptop that has elements made using the ocean-bound plastic. Pretty damn cool hey? 😎♻️🌊 Plus most importantly it’s incredibly light, weighing in at under 1kg, and has a super long battery life, meaning it’s ideal for my lifestyle 👌🏼 All these features are also extremely convenient for working from home, which I am currently doing and I know most of you are as well! ❤️ [ad - paid partnership] #lighterthanair #ad #newzealand #wanaka #exploremore #mountaingirl #hikingadventures #travelblogger
user_14;user_1441.jpg;How To Help 🥰 The current situation is seriously challenging, but the thing that warms my heart is how we are coming together and supporting our local communities. I wanted to share some top tips for if you’re fit, able and want to use your time to help those in need: 1️⃣ Sign up to @nextdoor. This app allows you to connect with your neighbours and offer your assistance if they need it. 2️⃣ Join @olio_ex #CookForKids where you can make and share school lunches with kids in your local area. 3️⃣ Sign up to NHS Volunteer Responders. Applications are currently closed but are expected to reopen soon. 4️⃣ Give blood. Blood banks are facing a severe shortage, visiting one is classified as an “essential journey” so in the UK can leave your house to do so. 5️⃣ Buy from a small or local business, many are struggling at this time and your custom will mean so much to them. 6️⃣ Donate to your local food bank. Many are having heavily reduced donations, check our local food banks website to see what they are short of. 7️⃣ Donate money. Of course many of us are facing money challenges at the moment but if you’re in the position to donate, there are numerous valuable causes you can support. Find one which resonates with you, e.g. I am donating to the Intensive Care Society. 8️⃣ Stay home. This is the easiest way you can help. Stay home, stay safe, wash your hands and follow the guidelines. Are you doing any of these? And what other ways are there for us to help?

user_14;user_1445.jpg;Picture this: It’s late 2020. Our houses are clean and organised. We’re more connected in our friendships and relationships because all we’ve been able to do is communicate. We’ve been forced to focus on self care, so we’re thriving. We come out of our houses, the world reopens and we are kinder, more loving, more grateful, more understanding and more appreciative of the beauty of life and human connection than ever before.

user_14;user_1446.jpg;If plastic is such an issue, can't we just ban it? 🤔 | AD I know plastic probably isn't at the forefront of everyones minds given our current situation, but I personally am still trying to keep mother nature in my thoughts through this turbulent time 🌍 I've definitely asked myself this question in the past and I am excited to be working with WRAP - the sustainability not-for-profit who have launched the @clearonplastics campaign - to share the most well informed answer with you guys 🤓 Ultimately, it isn't as simple as banning it all together. Plastic has its place in our modern world. It is durable, long lasting and provides an air/water/hygiene barrier for goods. For example with food products, this helps promote shelf life and reduce food waste (a huge issue in itself!) and with medical products this is essential for them to comply with safety and hygiene standards. As someone who undertook prolonged medical care in 2019 after my bowel surgery, I had to use a fair few plastic wrapped items when I was looking after my wound. In honesty, I found it hard to not feel guilty for my plastic consumption at that time, but I knew that this level of hygiene was important for my health 👩‍⚕️ Now don't get me wrong, I am not advocating for widespread plastic use. It isn't needed in many cases and can often be unnecessary and problematic. We need to of course focus on reduction, reusing and recycling - working towards a more circular economy when it comes to plastics. I have incorporated a whole host of sustainable swaps into my lifestyle over the past few years to reduce my personal plastic use, from switching to a reusable coffee cup through to changing up my period products (menstrual cups are a game changer!) ♻️ I would love for you to get involved in the conversation, leave a comment down below with your thoughts on plastic and follow @clearonplastics to stay in the know. Have you reduced it? Are you a recycling fiend? What changes have you made to your life to help fight plastic pollution? Let me and #clearonplastics know 💕 #sustainability #sustainableswaps #plasticpollution #sustainableliving #plasticwaste #reduce #reuse #recycle #circulareconomy
user_14;user_1447.jpg;Dark Choc & Raspberry Dreams 😻🌱 AD One thing I’ve been valuing so much during this time is perfecting my morning routine. When I wake up the first thing I do is take my daily @symproveyourlife shot to help support my gut health, that’s a non-negotiable. Then I’ll fuel myself, today my meal of choice was dark chocolate raspberry porridge - a yummy wholesome dish 🥰 ➡️ Let’s be honest guys, I never measure my meals so this hardly counts as a recipe 😂🙌🏼 Simply add a dash of cocoa powder & maple syrup to your porridge filled pan (oats and plant milk) and cook through. Then serve & top with fresh raspberries, chia seed, hemp hearts, raspberry dark chocolate and a dollop of cashew butter. Lush ✅ This is such a fibre rich meal which will give you energy to get through the day! What’s your favourite porridge flavour combo?

user_14;user_1449.jpg;Feeling incredibly grateful for blue skies & green space this beautiful Sunday 🥰☀️🍃 I know it sounds crazy but I feel like the sunshine this weekend was Mother Nature saying thank you to us all for slowing down 🙏🏼🌏 Pollution levels are falling rapidly and scientists are saying that it is looking increasingly likely that for the first time in decades global CO2 emissions might actually drop in 2020 🙌🏼 Of course, this doesn’t detract from the severity of the situation, the struggles we will face and the grief we will feel.

user_14;user_1450.jpg;"Just a reminder that “your power isn’t in the gym, it’s in you” - @kelseywells 🙌🏼❤️ . Gyms are closing and our routines are changing; we have to find new ways to move our bodies and take care of our minds. I don’t know about you but exercise is my escape, my ritual for resilience which I value on a daily basis. And that’s not going to be lost, it’s just going to adapt to this new reality. My living room floor is my new gym floor and that’s more than enough for me 🙏🏼 . Right now it is essential we take care of ourselves both physically and mentally. If you’re feeling lost on your fitness journey then I encourage you to take some time to reconnect with your why. Personally, I train to build strength and resilience so I can handle whatever life throws at me. And right now I need that more than ever.

user_14;user_1460.jpg;Making friends with the locals 🐮❤️ Inspired by my new pal Daisy, here’s three reasons to eat less beef 🥩 1️⃣ Livestock farming has huge environmental implications from land & water use through to deforestation & biodiversity loss. For example it takes 2,400 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef (compared to 244 for a pound of tofu) & over 90% of Amazon rainforest land cleared since 1970 has been used for beef grazing. 2️⃣ There is a strong evidence base showing that red meat consumption is linked with colorectal/bowel cancer and the @who recommends we limit our intake to support our health. 3️⃣ Cows are gentle giants. They’re socially complex animals, developing friendships and strong bonds. If they are raised with human contact they become big fuzz nuggets and love cuddles and strokes, like my girl Daisy 🥰 . This post is in no way meant to come across as preachy, just encouraging. Don’t be afraid to start small, what matters is that you make a positive change of any size 🙌🏼 #newzealand #purenewzealand #travelblogger #exploremore #getoutdoors #traveldiaries #travelgram #traveltheworld #travelguide #newzealandlife #nztravels #nzsouthisland #plantbased #plantpowered #friendsnotfood #veganaf #cowcuddles

user_14;user_1478.jpg;Refuse Plastic Waste 🌎♻️ ad Did you know that approximately 8 million pieces of plastic enter our oceans every single day? Thats a total of 12 million tonnes a year, a truckload a minute. This damages valuable habitats and harms innocent wildlife. As a scuba diver and ocean lover it breaks my heart 💔 Since I learnt about this a few years ago, I have made a conscious effort to reduce my personal plastic consumption on a daily basis by implementing sustainable swaps to my lifestyle. I believe that every little positive change we make adds up to a huge difference when we come together ♻️✅ . That's why I am so excited to hear about @dove's new positive plastic initiatives. By 2025 all their packaging will be either ➡️ 100% plastic free ➡️ made from 100% recycled plastic ➡️ or be completely reusable/refillable This is one of the biggest known plastic reduction plans of its kind in the global beauty industry and will have a massive impact. Not only will save 20,500 tonnes of virgin plastic a year - enough to circle the earth 2.7 times - but they will inspire other global brands to get on board and make changes too. This is a huge, positive and necessary step and I truly hope that it starts a ripple effect within the beauty industry 🥳🙌🏼 . Change starts with us all 🙏🏼 Tell me about your journey with single use plastics in the comments below - have you made any sustainable swaps to your lifestyle? Don't be afraid to start small 🥰❤️ #dovepartner #plasticwastefight #refusesingleuse #oceanplastic #plasticpollution #ecofriendly #fightplastic #reduceplastic #sustainableswaps #ecoswaps #ecotips #sustainability #sustainableliving
user_14;user_1479.jpg;"Yep I’m wearing the same outfit I wore to London Fashion Week last year and let me explain why 💁🏼‍♀️ A survey of UK women found they wore an item an average of only 7 times and that 1/3 of them consider clothes “old” after wearing them fewer than 3 times 👗 So here’s a much needed reminder that it’s perfectly ok to wear the same outfit over and over again, in fact it is necessary. I didn’t purchase a single new item for LFW and I’m a proud outfit re-wearer ♻️ . Fashion is one of the most polluting and resource heavy industries on the planet 🔥 To give you some context, it takes 2,700 litres of water to produce a single pair of jeans (enough water for you to drink for 2.5 years) & we produce 80 billion new pieces of clothing a year - and half of this quantity is estimated to be thrown into landfill within 12 months 😱 The situation is pretty dire so hell yes I’m going to wear the same items over and over again. Instagram makes it seem normal to have a new outfit for every occasion but here’s a reminder that it’s not 🙅🏼‍♀️ . I have always had a “wear until it falls apart - then mend it and wear it again” mentality when it comes to clothing; which has been instilled in me since a young age (thanks @yorkshirehelen!) ♻️ So please, dig through your wardrobe and give the items you already own some much needed love. It’s an easy and free way to be a little more sustainable 🥰🌎💙 #slowfashion #londonfashionweek #oootd #ootd #wiwt #ecofashion #outfitinspiration #lfw #sustainablefashion #staywildswim #ecodfashion #rewear #oldoutfit #ecofriendlyfashion #ecofriendly #sustainability #slowdownfastfashion"

user_14;user_1481.jpg;How to make SUPER thick & creamy smoothie bowls 🤩 Every time I show my brekkie on my stories one of the main question I get is “how did you get that texture in your smoothie?”. I personally like them to be so thick that they’re practically like ice cream, and it’s pretty easy to do with wholesome and delicious ingredients. Here’s how: ➡️ In short: Maximum frozen ingredients, minimum liquid. I always ensure my smoothies have a frozen banana in them [this is ESSENTIAL] and if possible another frozen fruit such as blueberries. If there isn’t another fruit in there then I add some ice cubes. Only put in a tiny bit of liquid, the minimum amount needed to bring the smoothie together. It can be a challenge to get it to blend but have patience! You’ll end up with a whipped, thick and filling smoothie which you can scoop with a spoon 😋 ➡️ Today’s smoothie recipe: 1 frozen banana, 1/2 a frozen avocado, 1 tbsp cacao powder, 1 tbsp almond butter, 1 scoop of @vivolife cacao protein powder, a handful of ice cubes and a dash of plant milk 🌱 ➡️ The topping? My granola of course 🙌🏼 Let me know if you use these tips! 🥰 [ad - ambassador. I am an ambassador for @vivolife vegan & carbon neutral supplements which come in compostable packaging.

What we eat can have a huge impact and by choosing to support sustainable practices we can push for positive change three (or more!) times a day 🙌🏻 Inspired by @riverford I wanted to share some simple tips to consume more consciously 🥬 1️⃣ Eat a more plant focused diet & less animal products. 2️⃣ Choose organic when possible. 3️⃣ Reduce your plastic & packaging consumption. 4️⃣ Eat seasonally and avoid air freight when possible. 5️⃣ Shop small, supporting local businesses & farmers. 6️⃣ Avoid palm oil when you can. 7️⃣ Reduce food waste and compost if you can. 🥦 Don't try and do everything at once, just start somewhere and incorporate small changes along the way - it can add up to a big difference. @riverford make it easy to do your bit for the planet, as their seasonal and organic produce boxes work towards all the above 7 points and more ✅ Let me know in the comments what you do to eat more sustainably?

user_14;user_1484.jpg;"How To Take Control Of Your Money 💰 #AD Let's be real, finances can be a little terrifying. ISAs, investments, interest rates ... there's a lot to think about! I am still very much on my own financial journey but I wanted to share with you 3 quick fire first steps, in partnership with @starlingbank, to help you feel more confident and in control of your money ✅ 1️⃣ Know your current situation. Yep, its time to check your bank statements and get to grips with your cash. How much money do you have? And how much is coming in and going out? Note it down. 2️⃣ Analyse your spending. This is key. Where are you spending money? What areas are necessities and what areas are luxuries? Identify any weak spots or unhelpful spending habits. The @starlingbank app features in depth daily spending analysis, which is automatically categorised into areas like ""travel"", ""groceries"" and ""eating out"". 3️⃣ Create an emergency fund. This is basically a safety cushion of cash to cover you in case of a broken boiler or a car accident. Having this in your back pocket allows you to feel less worried about unexpected circumstances. @starlingbank allows you to automatically or manually pop money in different digital pots you can use for specific goals, such as an emergency fund. ➡️ I am so excited that I am working with @starlingbank on this financial content. I have been a genuine user of the bank for the past 10 months and rave about it to all my pals!

user_14;user_1487.jpg;7 lessons I’ve learnt about friendship 🥰 1️⃣ You don’t always have to give the best advice to be a good friend, you just need to listen. 2️⃣ Friendships ebb and flow, people come in and out of your life over time and that’s ok. 3️⃣ You need friends who aren’t afraid to call you out on your sh*t, but there is a big difference between constructive criticism and unnecessary negativity. 4️⃣ Friendships take work. You have to prioritise the people you care about. 5️⃣ Similarly, to have good friends you need to be a good friend. It’s a two way street. 6️⃣ A strong and supportive friendship is one of the most incredible things you can have. 7️⃣ Quality not quantity, always 🙌🏼 Do you resonate with any of these lessons?

user_14;user_1488.jpg;Let’s talk about ethical banking 💰 Did you know that your money might be invested in fossil fuels, firearms and factory farming? Yep, most mainstream banks are some of the biggest investors in these industries and are using our money to do it. By choosing wisely when it comes to banking we are choosing what we want our money to fund 🙌🏼 So what are some example of more ethical banks? 🤔 Monzo, Tridos, The Co-Op and Starling are better than most. Although it’s hard to find a bank that’s perfect ✅ Ethical banks ensure that your money will be invested in socially and morally responsible ways and not in anything that could be to the detriment to society. Each bank has its own set of ethical aims so make sure you find one which is in accordance with your own beliefs 🥰 And did you know, your pension is an investment? So you can contact your employer and ask them to move it to an ethical fund too 👍🏼 Let me know if you found this useful in the comments, or tag a friend you think might find this interesting 😘❤️ 📸 @tamsinlouisephotography #ethicalbanking #ethical #positivechange #positivevibes #sustainability #sustainablefinance #femalefinances #empoweredwomen #sustainableswaps #ecofriendly

user_14;user_1490.jpg;There’s over 50g of plant based protein in this lunch 💪🏼🌱 Here’s what’s in the bowl: ➡️ @this.uk vegan chicken ➡️ puy lentils ➡️ mushrooms ➡️ tomatoes ➡️ mangetout ➡️ tenderstem broccoli ➡️ a hummus mountain ➡️ pumpkin seeds ➡️ tonnes of mixed herbs And I just want to share my personal view on vegan meats. Right now, over two years into my plant based journey, I usually only eat vegan meats a couple of times a week. I prefer to focus on whole foods like legumes and grains for my protein sources. I also add in tempeh, tofu and @vivolife protein powder when I need a concentrated hit of protein. However when I first started my journey I ate vegan meat replacements almost every day. This was what I needed to do to help me transition to a plant focused diet as I didn’t really know what to cook or how to build a balanced plate, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Ultimately it’s about finding your personal balance, and mine has shifted over the years away from vegan meats and towards more whole foods. Just read the label, stay informed on what you’re putting into your body & do what works for you! ✅🥰❤️ #plantbased #plantpowered #veganeats #veganfood #londonvegan #veganmeals #highprotein #plantbasedprotein #plantprotein #vegains #stronggirls #girlgains #plantsfortheplanet

user_14;user_1497.jpg;One year ago vs now ✨ Today is my one year emergency bowel surgery anniversary. The day where I almost had my life taken away from me 💉 And you know what? If I could go back, I wouldn’t change a thing. I am SO grateful that it happened. It made me take a step back and find joy in the little things: being able to walk, to stand, to sit up unassisted. It made me resilient. It made me strong. It made me grow in ways I never expected. It reignited my passion for fitness. It made me connect more deeply with those around me. It made me love and respect my body more than ever before. I know it sounds crazy, but it made me happier 🥰 The way I see it, I was assigned this mountain to show it can be moved. And damn, I moved it.

Being in nature, breathing in fresh air and getting rewarded with amazing views 😍 Today we scaled Table Mountain with @lancekime from @atlanticoutlook and it was EPIC 👏🏼 We took the India Venster route to the top, one of the most beautiful and exhilarating trails. It included steep rock climbs and the use of ladders, chains and stapels. (You can see it all on my stories!). What an adrenalin filled adventure - it made the climb so much more exciting! 🤩 The trail definitely isn’t for the faint hearted but honestly @lancekime made the whole experience so easy. I wasn’t scared even once! I couldn’t recommend @atlanticoutlook enough 🙌🏼 It’s also worth noting that there are much easier and less risky trails available such as Platteklip Gorge if you want them! ❤️ #hiking #hikinggirl #getoutdoors #mountaingirl #mountainlover #exploremore #greatoutdoors #wanderlust #hikingadventures #hikingtrails #tablemountain #southafrica

Yesterday we did a 85 minute run (!!!) and today we did 45 minutes!

user_14;user_14103.jpg;"5 ways to make an impact in 2020 🥰🌎 1️⃣ Buy less stuff. Our over consumption is one of the biggest issues we face today, so try to buy less, buy better and shop from small, independent and local brands when you do make a purchase. 2️⃣ Switch energy supplier. Renewable energy costs the same or cheaper than regular fossil fuels and is much better for the planet. Try Bulb or Octopus. 3️⃣ Change bank. Most mainstream banks will invest your money in things like fossil fuels, weapons, factory farming and tobacco. You can ask your employer to move your pension to an ethical fund, and then with your personal savings move to forward thinking ethical banks like Starling and Monzo. 4️⃣ Write a letter to your local council. Identify an area for improvement and ask for change in your community. For example I have contacted my council multiple times asking for composting bins, and will continue to do so. 5️⃣ Ask for change in your office. If you can push for change in your workplace it can have a huge impact. For example; removing single use plastic cups, introducing recycling bins or adding vegan options at the canteen. 🥰 Individually we have SO much power to push for positive change, so I hope these 5 tips help you take the first step 🌎❤️ #positivechange #climatechange #ecoblogger #consciousliving #livingconsciouslycrew #socialchange #savetheplanet #ecofriendly #sustainableswaps #ecoswaps #ecotips"
user_14;user_14104.jpg;"8 things I wish I knew before I went plant based 🌱 #AD Since it’s Veganuary, let’s talk about the reality of eating a vegan diet! We all know we should be eating more plants to support the planet, but before you get started here’s a few things I wish I knew at the start of my journey: 1️⃣ Increase your portions. Don’t just take the animal products out, add in more plants to take their place. Otherwise you’ll be a hungry lil human. 2️⃣ You will get gassy. You will most likely bloat. Your body needs time to get used to digesting larger amounts of fibre, have patience. It will pass with time. 3️⃣ Everyone and anyone who finds out you’re plant based will pass comment on your diet because it’s still a novelty in society. Some people will be lovely and some won’t. Rise above any judgement, be confident in your decision and just live your happy little plant based life. 4️⃣ Supplement. I advise talking to a dietician about this, but the usual guidelines are B12, vitamin D and an omega as a minimum. I personally also take iodine, iron and probiotics. Better to be safe than sorry! 5️⃣ Protein isn’t the be all and end all. You’ll get enough as long as you are conscious of your consumption. 6️⃣ It feels amazing to eat for a purpose higher than yourself; to eat for the planet and for the animals gives new meaning to every meal. 7️⃣ You have so much power to influence others. Your mates/boyfriend/family probably won’t go vegan overnight (or maybe ever). But by being a positive example you can inspire SO many people to reduce their animal product consumption. Woohoo! 8️⃣ You don’t need to label yourself. “Vegan” is a scary word and it entails a whole lifestyle outside of just your diet. Don’t force yourself into that bracket if you don’t want to. Just focus on making the best choices you can, and if that’s simply reducing your meat consumption then that’s an amazing step! 🙌🏼🥰 Photo taken at @eatbychloeuk - my fave vegan spot in London 🌱 #ad #ambassador #bychloe #eatbychloe #veganuary #veganmeals #plantbased #plantpowered #eatvegan #eatmoreplants"

I spent Saturday doing a training hike with my Kilimanjaro (or “Kili-no man-Jaro”) girls in the beautiful South Downs 🥾 And spent today with a lovely bunch of friends I made on my Sri Lanka fitness escape last year - we tried out Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (which was hilarious, check out my stories!) and refuelled with this EPIC vegan roast at @theroundhillpub 😋 You know what they say, a weekend well spent brings a week of content. And damn it was a lovely weekend - fresh air, good company and lots of laughs.

user_14;user_14109.jpg;5 things I wish I knew at the start of my fitness journey 💪🏼💦💥 After 8 years in the fitness world and MANY mistakes, here’s what I wish I knew at the very beginning. 1️⃣ Fitness is more than aesthetics. It’s building a strong, powerful and resilient body which can carry you through life. 2️⃣ Most fitness specific supplements aren’t necessary. Pre workout, BCAAS and creatine are a “nice to have” not a “need to have”. And fat burners? They’re nonsense 3️⃣ It’s a lifelong thing. You can’t just be fit for summer, you need to be fit for the rest of your life. Which is why it’s essential to find a form of movement which you enjoy. 4️⃣ Your form is more important than the weight you lift. Focus on learning key movement patterns before adding weight. 5️⃣ Not everything is for everyone. If you don’t like running/yoga/weights? That’s cool. There’s no one “correct” way to exercise, there’s just the way that works for you 🙌🏼 What do you wish you had known at the start of your fitness journey?

user_14;user_14110.jpg;📍 Northumberland - 5 things to see & do in my favourite county (after Yorkshire of course) 😝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Northumberland is the least populated county in England, home to the most castles and has a coastline which is a designated area of outstanding natural beauty ✨ I come here every year with my family and based on over a decade of holidays here are our top recommendations: 1️⃣ Drive over to Holy Island. An island you can only access when the tide is low. It had a castle and abbey to explore as well as cafes and beautiful coastal views. 2️⃣ Ross Back Sands. An absolute hidden gem of a beach, one of the most quiet in the area. It is three miles of unspoiled natural beauty. 3️⃣ The Dunstanburgh Castle Loop. A gorgeous walk taking in my favourite ruined castle in Northumberland! Park at Low Newton by the Sea and walk along the beach to Dunstanburgh Castle. Continue on to Craster, have a cheeky drink in the pub and then loop back behind the beach to where you started. Lush. 4️⃣ Chillingham Castle 🏰 A quirky and atmospheric 13th century castle which is full of character. One of the most unique we’ve ever visited! 5️⃣ Sugar Sands. Park at Howick and walk along the coastal path to Bulmer and Alnmouth via beautiful bays like Sugar Sands, then turn round and head back the way you came. This is one of our favourite walks! Have you ever visited Northumberland? What are your recommendations? Or is it on your hit list?

user_14;user_14113.jpg;6 things I want to do more in 2020 ✨ 1️⃣ Give compliments. Spread good vibes, lift others up and celebrate their success. 2️⃣ Shop secondhand. Brings less new things into my life and value what already exists. 3️⃣ Disconnect from technology. Spend less time looking at screens and more time looking up. 4️⃣ Respect my body. Treat it well, nourish it, challenge it, rest it, have gratitude for it. 5️⃣ Get outdoors. Explore, hike and connect with our beautiful home. 6️⃣ Spend my time wisely. It’s my most valuable asset, only give it to people and things I truly value 🙌🏼 What do you want to do more in 2020? ❤️ Photo: @chrispriestley__ 📸 #2020 #2020goals #2020vision #newyear #newyearseve #newyearstrongerme #newyearsresolution #newyearsameme #goalgetter #strongwoman #londonblogger #londonlife #coventgarden
user_14;user_14114.jpg;2019. What a year! One full of incredible highs and life threatening lows 💁🏼‍♀️😅 The year didn’t get off to the best start. In January I had emergency bowel surgery in The Maldives, experienced pain like never before, cancelled an 8 week trip of a lifetime with @stephelswood and came home to months of recovery 💉 I have to admit, my health issues did take over my life for a while and as a result I didn’t achieve everything I wanted this year. But I am so glad I focused my energy into my healing. I might not have hit every business target I wanted to, but I rebuilt my body from the ground up and that is one hell of an achievement 🥰🙌🏼 Plus I still managed to do some pretty cool stuff. @staywildswim grew exponentially, became stocked in @theofficialselfridges, exhibited at @londonfashionweek and was featured by @instagram. I came second place as the overall @cosmopolitanuk influencer of the year. I wrote, built and released two ebooks - Eat More Plants and Strong and Sculpted. I hosted a @bbc podcast, was in a global @adidas campaign, headlined @balance_festival, volunteered at @localoceanco and donated well over £5,000 to charity through my business. Plus I reconnected with one of my biggest passions: hiking 🥾⛰ However I also had many meltdowns, stepped away from my main brand partner, received an abundance of online hate and had those I’m close to face their own health issues 💔 It’s safe to say, it’s been a rollercoaster of a year. But it has made me more resilient than ever before. I am ready and excited to grab life with both hands as we enter 2020. New year, stronger me. Bring it on 👊🏼 #my2019 #2019reflection #newyear #newyears2019 #newyears #2019goals #thecanaryislands 2019journey #beforeandafter #transformationtuesday #emergencysurgery #cecalvolulus #twistedbowel #newyearnewme #surgeryrecovery #blogger #londonblogger #strongwoman #strongereveryday

user_14;user_14116.jpg;2009 vs 2019 ⏰ It’s amazing what a difference a decade can make hey?! 💁🏼‍♀️ #10YearChallenge . ➡️17 year old Zanna: I heavily binge drank, fuelled myself with super noodles, actively avoided exercise, didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and if I’m honest I didn’t really like myself. I took a lot of shit from people as a result 🍻 ➡️ 27 year old Zanna: I got a first class degree, moved to London, became a personal trainer, started two companies, turned plant based, overcame emergency surgery and accepted myself as I am. Oh and I take zero shit now 😝 . A lot can change in 10 years, we can’t define ourselves by our past but we can grow from what we experience. Here’s to the next 10 years of progress 🙌🏼❤️ #transformationtuesday #transformation #10yearslater #growth #development #selflove #selfacceptance #fitnessjourney #adulthood #decadechallenge

user_14;user_14119.jpg;Just coming to you with an important Christmas public service announcement 🙋🏼‍♀️👋🏼 This week you’ll probably be inundated with content telling you how to handle the festive season. Some will share workouts to “burn off” your mince pies and low calorie Christmas cake recipes. Others will encourage you to let loose at the buffet and embrace the sloth life 🦥 And what’s my opinion? Do whatever the hell you want 💁🏼‍♀️ Whether you want to stay active or settle into the sofa, do that. Whether you want to get boozy or stay teetotal, do that. Whether you want to watch your portions or go hard at Christmas dinner, do that. Health looks different to everyone and I’m not here to dictate what is best for you or what your body and mind needs, only you know that 🙌🏼 And me? I’ll be tucking into all the delicious festive food and snuggling under a blanket, but also eating lots of plants and staying active. Because it’s possible to do both 🥰🌱 Ultimately, you do you boo.

user_14;user_14122.jpg;5 ways to be a little bit more conscious this Christmas 🎅🏼🥰 1️⃣ Lets talk trees. You need to use a artificial tree for 30+ years for it to balance out its footprint - so only invest if you’re keeping it for the long term. If you go for a real one, you can always rent a tree and have it collected after Christmas and re-planted! Try and opt for FSC & Soil Association certified trees and if you didn’t rent one, try to ensure it is disposed of responsibly by seeking out a local tree recycling scheme. 🎄 2️⃣ Eat more plants. Plant based meals are lower impact and can be absolutely delicious. You don’t have to go “cold turkey” - pardon the pun! - but just cutting down on your animal product consumption helps reduce the footprint of your meals as well as animal suffering 🌱 3️⃣ Wrap responsibly. Avoid shiny & un-recyclable wrapping paper. You can upcycle newspaper, use recyclable brown paper or even reuse wrapping you’ve been given before. I like to give my gifts in pretty bags which can be passed on again and again. 💝 4️⃣ Avoid food waste. 7.9 million slices of turkey and 7.5 million mince pies go to waste each year in the UK alone. Use your leftovers by popping them in a soup or a Christmas sarnie. Compost anything else 🦃 5️⃣ Shop small. By less and buy better. Less tat and more gifts which are low waste, experience based or sourced from a small sustainable business 🎁 These are a great place to start, but of course there are many amazing sustainable swaps we can make at this time of year! 🙌🏼 What is your top conscious Christmas tip?

user_14;user_14127.jpg;Should food labels include the amount of exercise needed to burn them off? 🤔 I am on ITV News today discussing the new study which suggests this as a potential solution to rising obesity levels. In case you can’t tune in at 1.30pm then here’s the main thoughts I shared: ➡️ Food is so much more than calories. It’s micro and macro nutrients, it’s energy, it’s enjoyment and it’s fuel. It is a reductionist approach to focus on calories (or calories burned) alone. ➡️ Everyone processes food differently and exercise intensity is subjective, so a blanket exercise target or duration won’t be relevant to everyone. ➡️ This has the potential to lead to unhealthy relationships with food. It enforces an “earn and burn” mentality where food is seen as something to earn and exercise is seen as a punishment for what we eat. Surely we should encourage more positive approaches to healthy living? And ones which avoid negative emotions such as guilt? ➡️ Overall, I respect that researchers are trying to find new and innovative approaches to encouraging us to move our bodies, but personally I don’t think this is the best solution. What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments! 🥰❤️ #itvnews #dietculture #healthylifestyle #igfitness #fitnessmotivation #fitnessjourney #gettinghealthy #healthyliving #caloriecounting

user_14;user_14134.jpg;ad The London Litter Pick 🌎❤️ The trash that ends up in our oceans often starts its journey in cities. Waste like bottles, cigarette butts and straws make their way into streams and rivers, ending up in the sea.

user_14;user_14135.jpg;Note to self: people don’t like me, and that’s ok! It might even be a good thing 💁🏼‍♀️ I know people don’t like me. Online they message me, leave a comment or simply unfollow me. I’m confronted with this fact every day and as someone who is a people pleaser, at times it has been a massive headf*ck 😬 HOWEVER. I am here to tell you what I tell myself. The reasons why it is totally ok to not be liked by everyone. 1️⃣ It is impossible to make everyone like you. I have friends who are INCREDIBLE humans, yet people still don’t like them. It blows my mind. You just can’t please everyone no matter how lovely you are. 2️⃣ Being disliked means you’re not sitting on the fence, you’re not middle of the road. You stand for something, you challenge others opinions, you shift perspectives. You’re divisive and not everyone likes that. 3️⃣ Nobody else truly knows your full story, they’re judging you based on limited knowledge of who you are and what you’ve been through. 4️⃣ I’m not keen on some people, but I would never tell them. For someone to take the time out of their day to send you negativity, that’s a reflection of their own issues. 5️⃣ Really, who cares? So what someone doesn’t like you. But tonnes of other people do! Shake it off, you know you’re a good human and THAT is what matters 👏🏼 This is just a reminder that it is perfectly ok that not everyone likes you. You are more than enough for those who love you ❤️ Post inspired by @jera.bean 🙌🏼
user_14;user_14136.jpg;How To Turn Black Friday Green 🌍♻️🌱 This is just a little reminder that every time you spend money you’re casting a vote for the kind of world you want. Last year US consumers alone spent $6.2 billion on this ONE day. Please ask yourself, what will your money fund? 💰 Here’s my top tips to consume more consciously this Black Friday: ➡️ It’s not a good deal if you don’t need it. Don’t buy things you don’t want or need just because they’re on sale. ➡️ Only buy things you know you will wear or use again and again, the longer we use things the lower their footprint. ➡️ Ask “who made my clothes?”. If it sounds too cheap to be true, someone else is paying the price. ➡️ Shop what already exists. Hit up secondhand shops, repair your own clothing, swap with a friend. ➡️ If you do want to shop new today, try and support a small independent, ethical and sustainable brand. 🛍 Which brings me onto @staywildswim. Are we having a Black Friday sale? In a word, no. We work hard all year to keep our impact low, margins small and our ethics big. As a brand who puts the people and the planet first, we don’t want to promote overconsumption. Instead, if you do choose to support us this #BlueFriday we will be donating a portion of our profits to ocean charities (as always!). And if you want to avoid consumption completely then we will also be sharing direct charity donation buttons through our stories 🌊 🎁You have so much power with your purchases. Buy less, buy better. Let’s change the world together 🌎💙 #staywildswim #blackfriday #greenfriday #boycottblackfriday #sustainablefashion #ecofashion
user_14;user_14137.jpg;Getting in those greens 🌱 When I travel the one food I struggle to get in is my greens, so I always love tucking into them on my return home! And my favourite way? In a thick and creamy green smoothie like this 😍 ➡️ 1 frozen banana ➡️ 1/2 a frozen avocado ➡️ 1 big spoonful of almond butter ➡️ 1 cup of plant-based milk (you may need more depending on your desired consistency) ➡️ 2 tbsp of chia seeds ➡️ A handful of fresh or frozen spinach ➡️ A small handful of mint leaves (optional) ➡️ 1 scoop of @vivolife Thrive powder ➡️ 1/2 scoop of @vivolife vanilla protein powder 🌱 Just chuck it all in a blender and blast it! Them pour out and add your favourite toppings, I love chunky granola 😋 P.s. @vivolife are turning Black Friday green by planting 10 trees for every order placed, donating 10% of all revenue to charity and shipping with carbon neutral delivery 🌍✅ [ambassador] #greensmoothie #smoothiebowl #smoothierecipe #smoothiegoals #gethosegreens #eatmoreplants #plantpowered #veganeats #plantbased

user_14;user_14139.jpg;📍Patagonia, Chile 🇨🇱 Tag someone who would love this! 😍 Yesterday we drove across the border from Argentina and entered the Chilean side of Patagonia 🏔 We’re staying at the most incredible hotel @patagoniacamp, it’s what my little nature nerd dreams are made of 🤓 Tiny eco friendly yurts nestled into a remote hillside overlooking Torres Del Paines. Not to mention these epic hot tubs with a view. Great choice @antonymaule 🙌🏼 We only have a few nights here so we are going to be back to back hiking every day to try and see as much of this beautiful place as we can! Let me know any recommendations you have (we don’t have time for the full W or O hikes but can do sections of them!) and come follow along in my stories 🥰❤️ #Patagonia #Chile #torresdelpaines #exploremore #travelblogger #getoutdoors #nature #naturalbeauty #southamerica #travelgoals #travelgirls #outdoorgirls

user_14;user_14141.jpg;Patagonia Day One 🏔✅ Now I see why people say you can experience all four seasons in a day here! Mother Nature threw us a challenge in the form of strong wind and heavy rain 🌧 But as my mum would say - “there’s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing choices” (wise words @yorkshirehelen) 👏🏼 As a Yorkshire lass I wasn’t going to let a little rain stop me getting outdoors! So we wrapped up warm and headed off for a cheeky 20km hike through the mountains ⛰ I believe that we can’t control what happens to us but we can control our reactions. We could have chosen to stay inside but we braved the weather and ended up having an amazing time! Plus by about 2/3 of the way through our hike the rain stopped and the sun came out 🤩☀️ Fingers crossed the weather gods work in our favour tomorrow (as it’s going to be our anniversary!)🤞🏼❤️ #patagonia #elchalten #hikinggirl #girlswhohike #thegreatoutdoors #hiking #hikingcouple #cerrotorre

user_14;user_14144.jpg;So today I threw myself off a mountain top attached to a big fabric bag 🤣 After my bowel surgery in January I was told that it could happen again at any moment, but I refuse to live in fear. I appreciate the fragility of life now and I don’t just want to exist, I want to LIVE. So I am pushing myself out my comfort zone and chasing new experiences as much as possible - like paragliding! Surprisingly I wasn’t scared at all and as you can probably tell from the massive smile on my face - I loved every second! 😆🙌🏼 Now tell me - would YOU throw yourself off a mountain? 🌍 P.s.

user_14;user_14148.jpg;Warm “Nutella” Brekkie Bowl 😍🌱 AD This warm chocolate hazelnut bowl is packed full of plant based protein and healthy fats. Plus it is ridiculously easy to make and super warming on a cold winter morning 🙌🏼 ➡️ Mix 1/4 cup of chia seeds with 1 cup of plant milk and 1 tbsp of cacao powder. Combine thoroughly and allow to sit until the chia seeds become thick and goopy (you can leave this in the fridge overnight to save time). ➡️ Once thickened, pop the chocolate chia mix into a pan over a medium heat and stir well. Add in a little more plant milk if needed. Stir through a tbsp of hazelnut butter (or other nut butter!). ➡️ Take off the heat and stir through 1 heaping tbsp of @vivolife cacao protein powder. ➡️ Top with roasted hazelnuts and anything else you fancy! I love coconut yoghurt and even more nut butter 🙊 Let me know if you give it a go!

user_14;user_14149.jpg;Would you RENT a dress? 💃 I can’t be the only one who has bought a “special dress” for an occasion and then only worn it once or twice!? 🙊 Our clothing actually has a huge impact on the environment 🌎 One rubbish truck of textiles is thrown away every second, 50% of fast fashion items are disposed of within a year and a staggering 235 million items of unwanted clothing went to landfill in the UK in 2017 🙅🏼‍♀️ There are tonnes of positive initiatives coming into to play to tackle these issues, one of which is clothing rental! ♻️ Yesterday I visited the @hurr pop-up where you can rent an item for a couple of days up to a week or longer. Renting gives us a dopamine hit and fulfils our desire for something new, while also extending the lifespan and reducing the carbon footprint of clothing garments. It’s a win-win and a positive step towards a more circular fashion industry ✅ Plus - many of these clothing pieces are designer items worth hundreds of pounds. Items we perhaps wouldn’t buy full price but can rent for a special occasion like a wedding - then give back! 🤩👗 Let me know in the comments - would YOU rent a dress? 🥰❤️ #hurrgirls #clothingrental #sustainablefashion #ecofriendly #slowfashion #hurr #oootd #rentalrevolution
user_14;user_14150.jpg;My kind of #TransformationTuesday 🌍🙌🏼 There is no better feeling than turning a @staywildswim sustainable swimwear idea into a reality! Swipe right to see a sneak peak of the process 🙊 A lot goes on behind the scenes from digitally sketching ideas in a coffee shop to creating numerous samples of the pieces at our London factory, adjusting the measurements and refining the design with each one. Once this is nailed we can try the designs on models of different sizes, ensure it ticks all the boxes and fits perfectly, make any final tweaks and go into production ✅ And finally... the best bit! We get to receive the pieces, shoot them on our models and then finally see them on YOU! Hearing your feedback and being tagged in your photos is just incredible, if a little surreal 🤩 I think as we come towards the end of the year it is natural to become reflective - and I just can’t quite believe how far @staywildswim has come. From an idea in our mind to a thriving business which is pushing for positive change in the fashion industry ♻️ Thank you so much for supporting us and in turn supporting sustainable business, local production, fighting ocean plastic, contributing to charity, paying people fairly and treading lightly on the planet 🌍❤️ #staywildswim #sustainablefashion #onlinebusiness #entrepreneur #femalefounder #ecofashion #sustainableswimwear

user_14;user_14152.jpg;World Vegan Day 🌱 While I don’t personally label myself as vegan anymore, I do follow a predominantly plant based diet and I am a strong advocate for eating more plants 🙌🏼 Adding plants into your diet and reducing animal products is an amazing way to access a whole host of nutrients, support the planet and reduce animal suffering 🌍 However I know it can be a little overwhelming so here’s my top tips for those wanting to start shifting their eating habits: 1️⃣ Don’t be afraid to start with small steps first, I began with just reducing red meat and then went from there. Why not try meatless Monday’s first or making all your lunches veggie for a week. Incremental changes are easier to stick with ✅ 2️⃣ Keep yourself motivated. There’s a lot of bizarre peer pressure around eating meat. To combat this, expose yourself to information which keeps you inspired to eat more plants. For example I have a comprehensive resources page on my website with links to articles and research on why we need to shift our diets to be more plant focused 🤓 3️⃣ Enjoy the journey. Since I started eating this way I’ve become much more experimental in the kitchen. Take pleasure in finding new plant powered meals which you love! Check out vegan friendly restaurants and dip your toe into the vegan alternatives available - some of them are pretty banging 😋 4️⃣ Plan ahead. If you have zero experience of veggie or vegan meals then you’ll save yourself a lot of time if you plan your meals a little. Check out online food creators, cooking websites and recipe books (cheeky plug but I do have a pretty awesome ebook - link is on my bio) 😉 5️⃣ Chill out about protein. Be conscious of your intake but you REALLY don’t need as much as you think 💪🏼 6️⃣ You don’t have to label yourself. People will want to categorise you but you don’t have to call yourself veggie, vegan or anything really. Just eat in a way which aligns with your values 🌍🙌🏼 Are you on a journey to eating more plants? Let me know in the comments below! ❤️ #worldveganday
user_14;user_14153.jpg;Just two girls tryna save the planet one swimsuit at a time 🌍 Since we started @staywildswim - a small sustainable brand - I have truly learnt how tough it is to build a business which is positive for the people and the planet. It’s challenge after challenge, hurdle after hurdle. So every bit of support literally means the world 🙌🏼 If you’re wondering how to support a sustainable brand like @staywildswim, here’s my top 3 tips ✅ 1️⃣ Use the power of your buying decisions. When you need to buy a new item try to source it from an independent, sustainable and ethical brand. This directly supports their ability to grow, develop and push for change in the industry. (Disclaimer: Many sustainable brands are more expensive so just do this when you can) 👙 2️⃣ Follow them on social media, engage with their content and use your online influence. Brands put so much time and effort into building their online presence so your support, comments and likes makes it all worth it 🥰 3️⃣ Tell your friends. Open up conversations with those around you about shopping more sustainably and if they ask for recommendations try to mention brands doing positive things. Word of mouth is the most trusted form of recommendation 💬 P.s. today was probably one of the most exciting shoots/days in the whole existence of Stay Wild!!!

user_14;user_14155.jpg;Finding balance after bowel surgery 💉 AD After my emergency surgery earlier this year I had to take a series of antibiotics to support my recovery. However once I had finished these I was desperate to restore the balance in my gut and promote the good bacteria in my bowel 🦠 I started taking @symproveyourlife daily from literally 2 weeks post op and I am still taking it every single day, now almost 9 months later. Why? Because Symprove has been proven to out perform competitors in getting good live bacteria to the gut where they can survive, thrive and multiply 🤓 I see @symproveyourlife as an amazing way to maintain ongoing good gut health and continue to support my microbiome ✅ If you watch my stories or YouTube videos you have seen that I genuinely love and use this brand, which makes me so excited to be partnering with them over the next few months and sharing my experiences using the product 🥳 Have you tried @symproveyourlife?

I bloomin LOVE pumpkin pie and these oats are not only packed with flavour but tonnes of plant powered goodness, fibre and nutrients 😋 ➡️ Simply cook 1/2 cup rolled oats with 1 cup of plant based milk on the stove. Simmer away on a low heat for around 10 minutes until cooked through and your desired texture is reached. ➡️ Remove from the heat and stir through 3 tbsp of pumpkin purée, 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice mix (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves) and 1 scoop of Vanilla @vivolife Protein Powder.

user_14;user_14162.jpg;5 reasons to eat more plants 🌱 1️⃣ A single day on a plant based diet can save over 1000 litres of water, 45 pounds of grain and 30 square foot of forested land compared to a traditional western diet 🌎 2️⃣ World fish populations are set to collapse by 2048 with over 80% of current fish stocks being overfished or collapsed already. 46% of the great Pacific garbage patch is fishing nets 🎣 3️⃣ It’s a more compassionate choice. 153 million farm animals are killed a day for human consumption. That’s 56 billion a year, not even including marine life 🐷 4️⃣ Plants a nutrient dense powerhouses. They’re packed full of fibre, phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals and goodness. Plus there’s 20,000 species of edible plants, the possibilities are endless 😋 5️⃣ It’s not necessarily about going vegan, it’s about making any small positive change. Just start with reducing your consumption. A 2014 study showed that by simply halving your meat consumption you have 40% reduced nitrogen emissions, 40% reduced dietary GHG emissions and 23% less land use ✅ We don’t need 100 people living a perfectly sustainable life, we need billions trying to make small changes. Don’t be afraid to get it wrong, just start! Every little bit adds up 🥰 Eating yummy vegan food at my favourite lunch spot @eatbychloeuk [ambassador] ❤️ #eatmoreplants #plantsfortheplanet #plantbased #plantpowered #plantbasedeats #veganeats
user_14;user_14163.jpg;The face of someone about to have a camera put up their bum💩🤣 I don’t know about you but I had heard mixed reviews about colonoscopies so was expecting the worst 😖 The reality though? Personally, I found it to be a breeze. The prep was smooth and simple. The procedure itself was pain free (thanks to the wonder of sedatives!). And afterwards? I feel great! 🙌🏼 I have been documenting my experience on my stories and received messages from women who had actually cancelled their colonoscopies from fear of the procedure! This worries me so much as colonoscopies can help diagnose potentially life threatening diseases and conditions. So I hope that by sharing my experiences I can help show you guys that it isn’t anything to be afraid of. In fact it’s something which can provide you answers and relief 🥰 My colonoscopy today was to check out my cecum after it twisted (and almost killed me!) back in January. It was recommended by my colorectal surgeon here in the UK as a final check to finish my circle of care. The doctor said everything looked great, which is hugely reassuring! 🙏🏼🙌🏼 You can see the images of my insides on my stories so feel free to have a watch 😝💖 #colonoscopy #colonoscopyprep #bowelbabe #bowelbabes #cecalvolvulus #bowelsurgery
user_14;user_14164.jpg;Don’t die of embarrassment 💩 If you watch my stories you know that since my bowel surgery I have been open in discussing bums, poo and all the taboos. I’m even sharing my experience getting a colonoscopy tomorrow. Why? Because there is so much unnecessary shame surrounding these topics 🤭 Bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the UK, taking a life every 30 minutes. But nobody is talking about it. We NEED to open up the conversation. I’ve had nurses message me saying that they are dealing with end of life patients who didn’t make it because they were too embarrassed to get their symptoms checked out. Thousands die a year because they would rather suffer in silence than admit they have constipation, diarrhoea or rectal bleeding 😩 In contrast, if you go straight to the doctors and get diagnosed in stage one the survival rate is 97% over 5 years! 🙌🏼 So please, don’t die of embarrassment. If you have changes in your bowel habits, bleeding or unexplained fatigue then get booked in with your GP. Then discuss it with your friends. Talking about bowels can save lives, saving people the embarrassment will not 🙅🏼‍♀️ #bowelcancer #bowelbabe #breakthetapoo #pootaboo #bowelsurgery #cecalvolvulus #dontdieofembarassment

user_14;user_14166.jpg;This #worldmentalhealthday I want to remind you that your feelings are valid ❤️ I often downplay my own low moments as “first world problems” and laugh it off. But the reality is that we can ALL have times where we feel anxious, overwhelmed and like we’re struggling to cope. All those feelings are valid, no matter the circumstances 👌🏼 I’m someone who has had a fairly smooth ride with mental health, but this year has been a little more challenging. Surprisingly my near death experience and emergency bowel surgery didn’t shake me. I hardly cried. I didn’t get low. I focused on getting better and was ridiculously positive throughout my recovery 🙌🏼 But now that life is back to normal? When you would assume I would be in an even better head space? This is when I have struggled. I’ve had weeks when I’ve cried almost every day from overwhelm and days when I’ve been so anxious that my heart feels like it’s going to burst out my chest. And the worst part? That I keep it to myself and feel ashamed about it because strangers on the internet tell me I’m too privileged to struggle 🙅🏼‍♀️ Well this is a reminder to myself, and to you, that your feelings are nothing to be ashamed of.

Climb the career ladder, save for a house, and nail our finances. Stay healthy, train regularly and eat well. Perfect our skincare routine, get our hair cut and book in regular dental checks. Read books, pursue hobbies and plan holidays. Spend time with our partner, friends and family members. Understand global affairs, live sustainably and consume consciously. Clean the house, take out the bins and stay on top of the washing. Oh and all while somehow finding time to get 8 hours of sleep, journal, meditate AND avoid stress!? 🧘🏼‍♀️ The list is endless! Modern life has become a constant state of overwhelm yet we are told we should miraculously balance it all. We end up getting stressed about the fact we are stressed 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 The reality is that we CAN’T do it all. And we shouldn’t be expected to. There simply aren’t enough hours in the day! We have to find what is most important to us on an individual level and be realistic with our time and energy. I know it’s easier said than done, but release the pressure to do it all and instead do your best 🥰🙌🏼❤️ #adulting #howtoadult #growingup
user_14;user_14168.jpg;AD | Did you know that clothing tags can contain single use plastic? Even the paper ones! 🌍 Thankfully there is a sustainable option for brands to choose – ECO™ RFID which is 100% recyclable and plastic free - but we need to raise awareness of this little known issue! Individual changes are extremely valuable and all add up, but when a brand makes a change it takes it to a whole new level - it can save hundreds of thousands of pieces of single use plastic! ✅ So please use your voice and tag your favourite fashion brands in the comments below! Let's encourage them to make the sustainable swap to ECO™ RFID tags. It is super simple and if all the big brands made the switch it would have a huge impact! ♻️ To find out more head over and follow @lookfortheleaf_ 🍃 #LookForTheLeaf #sustainablefashion #sustainableswaps #slowfashion #ecofriendly
user_14;user_14169.jpg;What supplements do I take as a plant based human?! 🌱 This is something which has changed and evolved over my past two years of eating predominantly plants. I’ve now found my perfect combination and wanted to share it with you: ➡️ Vitamin B12 ➡️ Vitamin D ➡️ Vegan Omegas ➡️ Iodine ➡️ Iron (I have a heavy cycle so this is recommended by my doctor) I am so excited that @vivolife just launched a vegan omega 3 supplement 🥳 Usually people supplement fish oil to get their omegas but I don’t wanna harm my fishie friends 🐠 So @vivolife get it straight from sustainably grown algae, cold press it in a chemical free extraction and add natural citrus extracts for a lemon flavour 🍋 Plus it has the perfect ratio of EPA to DHA ✅ All @vivolife products are certified vegan, organic and carbon neutral - which I am a huge supporter of 🌎👏🏼 Use the code ZANNA10 for 10% off your order 🙌🏼❤️ [Disclaimer: supplementation is personal to you, I always recommend doing your own research & talking to a dietician] #vivolife #fortheliving #veganliving #plantbased #vegansupplements #plantpowered #veggie #vgang

user_14;user_14172.jpg;It’s @staywildswim’s birthday! 🎂 Comment down below if you remember the day we first launched! 🥳 Today our baby brand turns one and I can’t quite believe it! The past year has flown by and Stay Wild has grown more than @natalieglaze and I ever anticipated! 👶🏼 It has been a whirlwind 12 months which included selling out styles, being stocked in @theofficialselfridges and exhibiting at @londonfashionweek! 🤩 But it’s also been a challenging year of many meltdowns, tears and waves of self-doubt. The reality of running a small sustainable start up brand isn’t all that glamorous 😅 That being said, @staywildswim is the most rewarding thing Nat and I have ever worked on. I couldn’t be more proud of what Stay Wild has become over the past 12 months and I see this as just the beginning. The first of many birthdays to come as we try to change the fashion industry from the inside out, leading the way in sustainable and ethical swimwear ♻️🌎 Bring it on year two! 🌊👏🏼 Outfit: jacket is secondhand from @one_scoop_store, jeans are old @topshop, tee is @staywildswim and kicks are @eytys ❤️ #staywildswim #sustainablefashion #slowfashion #ecofashion #oootd #businesspartners #entrepreneurs #femalefounders #girlboss
user_14;user_14173.jpg;My three intentions for today: ➡️ Work through my to do list with focus (aka put my phone on airplane mode!) 🤓 ➡️ Cook myself three nourishing meals (I need this after 10 days on the road!) 🌱 ➡️ Give at least one compliment (spreading good vibes is key) 🔑 We’re coming to the end of the working week but we can still achieve so much! What is your intention for today? Writing it down makes it much more motivating 🙌🏼❤️ #intentions #goalsetting #todolist #motivation
user_14;user_14174.jpg;California, it’s been a pleasure 🇺🇸 I’m so grateful that I got to share one of my favourite destinations in the world with @stephelswood 👯‍♀️ Northern California may have taken pride of place as as my most loved spot in the state 🙊 It is just so wild and untouched! This trip has been a whirlwind of snow capped mountains, crystal clear lakes, redwood forests and rugged coastlines. We got a taste of all the natural beauty Cali has to offer 🌊 And besides all the outdoorsy goodness? My stomach hurts from laughing so much with the dream team @marcbaechtold @stephelswood. These two are just 👌🏼 Today marks the end of my third road trip as a @visitcalifornia ambassador and I’m already excited for the next! 🥳 But for now it’s time to head back to the UK with my fave @airnz and arrive in London feeling refreshed and ready for what madness it has to throw at me! 🇬🇧 @onlyinsf @visitcalifornia AD ❤️ @marcbaechtold 📸 #visitcalifornia #onlyinsf #exploremore #getoutdoors #caliroadtrip #highwayone #caligirls #californiaroadtrip #roadtripping
user_14;user_14175.jpg;When two Londoners go camping... 😂 We’re coming into the last few days of our California road trip and are finishing up by driving along the iconic Highway 1 shoreline road 🚗💨 I am a big fan of the northern Cali coast as it’s so wild and rugged! It’s nothing like the sandy beaches of the south, and I’m loving the dramatic landscapes 🌊 Last night we camped at @mendocino_grove - a safari style “glamping” spot with heated beds, campfires and vegan s’mores 🔥(@stephelswood would disown me as a friend if I made her use a sleeping bag - gotta ease her into the outdoorsy life!) 😝 And now for our final day of adventures!

user_14;user_14176.jpg;📍Avenue of The Giants, California 🇺🇸 For once in my life, I felt small 😂🙌🏼 But seriously, walking through California Redwood trees is such a humbling experience. These beasts can grow to more than 320 foot tall (30+ floors), almost 30 foot wide and reach an age of 2,000 years old! That means they are the tallest trees on earth and some of them were alive during the Roman Empire! 🤩 Yesterday we drove the Avenue of The Giants, a road which runs parallel to the iconic Highway 1. It weaves in between these incredible trees with tonnes of spots to stop off and admire them. There’s even one so wide you can drive through it! 😱 These coastal redwoods only grow in this part of the world, so I’m so glad we got to experience them 🇺🇸 P.s. swipe right for a treat 😝 @redwoodcoaster @visitcalifornia AD ❤️ @marcbaechtold 📸 #visitcalifornia #redwoodcoast #coastredwoods #getoutdoors #exploremote #redwoodforest
user_14;user_14177.jpg;Tag a friend who would love this 😍🙌🏼 Last night we picked up a house boat (fully equipped with a hot tub & slide!) and sailed into the middle of Lake Shasta, California 🇺🇸 It was the perfect spot for a swim and some star gazing! ✨See more on my stories 🥰 @shastamarinahouseboats @shastacascade @visitcalifornia ❤️ AD 📸 @marcbaechtold ✌🏼 #visitcalifornia #roadtriprepublic #roadtripcalifornia #exploremore #getoutdoors #travelblogger #travelgoals #travelvibes #californiagirls #calilife
user_14;user_14178.jpg;There is no time to be bored in a world as beautiful as this ✨ Yesterday’s hike was an absolute belter! We had epic panoramic views in all directions and finished off with a skinny dip in a crystal blue mountain lake. It doesn’t get much better than that 😍 You can see it all on my stories! 🙌🏼 Tag a friend who would love this view 👯‍♀️ 📍Castle Lake, California 🇺🇸 📸 @marcbaechtold ✌🏼 AD @visitcalifornia @shastacascade #visitcalifornia #shastacascade #mountshasta #castlelake #heartlake #roadtripcalifornia #getoutdoors #exploremore #caliroadtrip #norcal #northerncali #mountaingirl
user_14;user_14179.jpg;📍Lassen Volcanic Park, California 🇺🇸 Yesterday we racked up well over 20,000 steps across three hikes in this hidden gem destination 💎 Our guide @mountshastaguide told us that it is one of the least visited national parks in the whole of the USA, which completely blew my mind! 🤯 Honestly - it is by far one of the most beautiful places I’ve explored in California. A real treasure trove of waterfalls, panoramic hiking trails and lots of bubbling volcanic rock! 🔥 I almost don’t want to share this secret spot with the world, but you guys deserve to experience its natural beauty - so definitely add it to your bucket list ✅ You can see more of our adventures on my stories 🥰❤️ @visitcalifornia @shastacascade AD 📸 @marcbaechtold #visitcalifornia #shastacascade #lassenvolcanicpark #nationalpark #roadtripcalifornia #exploremore #getoutdoors #naturegirls
user_14;user_14180.jpg;Touchdown California! 🇺🇸 I’m so grateful that I get to introduce @stephelswood to one of my favourite places in the world 🌎 If you’ve never visited then you might assume Cali is just a beach destination but it’s SO diverse. It is home to sun soaked coastlines to snow capped mountains and everything in between, all in one state! 😍 We’re kickstarting our trip by exploring @shastacascade in Northern California - taking in the beautiful lakes, dense forests and numerous waterfalls it has to offer 🌲 Our first stop? Lake Almanor! Which is SUCH a hidden gem - we practically had the whole place to ourselves!

user_14;user_14181.jpg;California, I’m coming for you! 🇺🇸 AD I am so excited for my third trip as the UK ambassador for @visitcalifornia 🥳 And this time!? I’m bringing @stephelswood along for the ride! Steph has never been to America so I can’t wait to experience this with her! 👯‍♀️ Over the next 10 days we’re going to be road tripping through the lesser known areas in Northern California! 😻 This part of Cali doesn’t see as many tourists - it’s a treasure trove of mountains, beautiful landscapes and rugged coastlines so we will definitely uncover some hidden gems 💎 Some spots we will be hitting up include: Shasta Cascade, The Redwood Coast and Mendocino County. Leave a comment down below if you’ve been to any of them and what your recommendations are! Personally I’m so excited to summit Mount Shasta! 🤩 Disclaimer: I am very aware that travelling isn’t the most sustainable of activities, but it’s a huge part of my job! As a result I always try to choose forward thinking airlines when I fly. Steph and I will be travelling to Cali with @airnz who just won the ATW Eco airline of the year award! ✈️ They have a carbon offsetting program (which I took full advantage of!) and this year alone they’re removing almost 55 million single use plastic items from their operations 👏🏼 Come and follow our adventures on @stephelswood and I’s stories! It’s going to be one hell of an adventure!!! 🥰❤️ #airnz #betterwaytofly #visitcalifornia #roadtripcalifornia #california #californiaadventure #girlstrip #roadtrip #travelblogger #exploremore
user_14;user_14182.jpg;Standing up for what I stand on today at the #globalclimatestrike 🌎 Striking for our planet and our future 🙌🏼 Honestly it makes me well up seeing so many Londoners of all ages and backgrounds come together for a cause which unites us all - our home 🙏🏼 The situation is getting rather dire. Wildlife populations have dropped by an average of 60% in 40 years. Over half the worlds coral reefs have already died as a result of climate change. We are breaking global temperature records year on year. 150 acres of rainforest are destroyed every minute of every day. Extreme weather events have more than doubled in the past 40 years. We’re set to have a climate refugee crisis with up to 200 million people being displaced by climate change by 2050. Despite all this? Global emissions are increasing year on year. Pretty sh*t isn’t it? 💩 We NEED wider political and government change. BUT taking action like attending a protest is an amazing way to push towards this positive change! Can’t attend today? Share this post, share this message, use your voice and spread the conversation far and wide! We only have so much time to save our earth, and the time is NOW 👏🏼🌎💙 #globalclimatestrike #fridaysforfuture #strikeforthefuture #climatestrike #saveourhome #saveourfuture #savetheoceans #climateactivist

user_14;user_14185.jpg;Just a Yorkshire gal who somehow ended up as a designer at London Fashion Week 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 This week has been a seriously surreal experience. From having Anna Wintour compliment @staywildswim’s fabrics to sitting on the front row as a guest of @instagram - I’ve pinched myself multiples times a day 🤩 But @natalieglaze and I weren’t there to live it up (even though we did a little bit 😝), we were there to try and inspire conscious change in the fashion industry. As part of the #positivefashion exhibition we had a chance to talk to press, industry insiders and other designers about how we incorporate ethical and sustainable practices into our brand @staywildswim 🌊 Everyone we spoke to was super enthusiastic about what we are doing and intrigued by our slow fashion approach. I was particularly reassured the conversations we had with the @britishfashioncouncil who are making sustainability a huge priority going forward. The CEO @97crush even bought one of our pieces! 🥳 Honestly, the whole experience filled me with SO much hope 🙏🏼 I truly believe that positive change is coming and I am so proud that @staywildswim is at the forefront of this movement 🌊🌎 Outfit details: everything I’m wearing is a few years old! 💙 #londonfashionweek #lfw #positivefashion #ethicalfashion #slowfashion #staywildswim #sustainablefashion #ecofashion
user_14;user_14186.jpg;My high protein plant based lunch 🌱 Check out this bowl of organic goodness 😍 It might just look like a regular nourish bowl but in reality every single ingredient is 100% organic 🥳 [ad] Why? I #ChooseOrganic when I can because it supports farming methods which care for the health of our soil and eco systems. There is no magic bullet to tackle climate change and environmental degradation - but the buying decisions we make every day are a powerful form of direct action, and organic is a positive part of the solution 🌎 Here’s what I ate today: ➡️Chilli and garlic tofu ➡️ Basmati rice ➡️ Edamame beans ➡️ British tomatoes ➡️ Pumpkin seeds ➡️ Nutty sauce - made from peanut butter, soy sauce & a dash of lime 😋 This meal has over 30g of protein - who said you couldn’t get strong eating plants? 😝💪🏼 @OrganicUK #Ad #FeedYourHappy #OrganicSeptember #ChooseOrganic
user_14;user_14187.jpg;Today is my 2 year veganniversary! 🌱 So let’s talk about why I no longer call myself vegan 🤷🏼‍♀️ Being a human with a social media platform comes with its pressures. I receive a steady stream of messages pointing out my inadequacies on an almost daily basis, many of which have been about veganism. And fair enough, I’m happy to take on board feedback and suggestions, but I’m also human - a human who is growing and evolving. But it’s hard to grow and evolve under an microscope 🔬 So, recently I came to the decision that the label of “vegan” wasn’t appropriate for me anymore. I struggle with the pressure to tick all the vegan boxes and I don’t want to offend vegans who do. The title of being vegan deserves respect and is for people who adopt the philosophy into all aspects of their life - and I’m not one of those people. So from now on? I’m calling myself plant based in hopes that it releases the pressure placed upon me 🙌🏼 Not don’t get me wrong, I still eat a predominantly vegan diet. But I’m much more flexible and relaxed in my approach. I truly believe that adopting a plant focused diet is the best thing I’ve EVER done. It supports the environment, it reduces animal suffering and it allows my body to thrive 🌱 I envision myself eating this way long into the future, so here’s to many more years of being fuelled by plants 🥰❤️ #plantbased #veganjourney #myveganjourney #plantpowered #veganniversary
user_14;user_14188.jpg;How excited we feel about exhibiting at LONDON FRICKIN FASHION WEEK 🥳 Yeah some people might play it cool but we are just so overwhelmed by this amazing opportunity and keep doing lil happy dances! 😝 @staywildswim isn’t even one year old and to be able to present our brand and discuss our ethos at @londonfashionweek is a huge honour. As a tiny sustainable company this feels like a huge step in the right direction and a valuable chance for us to help inspire positive change in the fashion industry from the inside out 🌎 So if you’re at LFW please pop down and say hey! We are located in the positive fashion exhibition and will happily chat all things ocean plastic and sustainable fashion! 👋🏼 And again a gigantic thank you to the @britishfashioncouncil for giving @staywildswim this opportunity 🙏🏼💙 #Londonfashionweek #britishfashioncouncil #lfw #sustainablefashion #staywildswim #ecoswimwear #sustainableswimwear #ethicalfashion #positivefashion
user_14;user_14189.jpg;Playing a game of “how many plants can I get on my plate?” 🌱 When I am lucky enough to make my own meal I always focus on getting in as many different nutrient dense foods as possible! This lunch contains: ➡️ Rocket ➡️ Sundried Tomatoes ➡️ Fresh tomatoes ➡️ Herby garlic mushrooms ➡️ Pesto @tofurkyuk vegan chicken ➡️ Pomegranate seeds ➡️ @yoganvegan almond cheese ➡️ Chopped almonds ➡️ Pumpkin seeds ➡️ @lucysdressings tangy dressing It is support important to not just get in fruits and veggies but to get in a VARIETY of them! If we eat the same ones all the time, which I am definitely guilty of, we don’t expose ourself to different nutrients and can potentially develop deficiencies in the long term 😅 So next time you’re at the supermarket try picking up a new local and seasonal veggie and incorporating it into your meal! Your body will thank you - as will your local farmers 🙏🏼💙 #plantbased #plantpowered #veganeats #nutrientdense
user_14;user_14190.jpg;2017 vs 2019 💪🏼 A cheeky little #transformationtuesday 💃 This ones a little different as I am actually physically stronger in the left hand photo. ➡️ Back in 2017 fitness was a huge part of my life. I was consistent with my training. I was deadlifting over 100kg and doing 8+ pull ups in a row. My body was a machine 🤖 ➡️ Fast forward to 2019: fitness has taken a back seat. I train more sporadically. I deadlift 70kg. I haven’t done a pull up in months. My priorities have changed 🤷🏼‍♀️ ➡️ So I guess the question is: is this regression or progression? In my eyes, it’s progress. Progress isn’t always measured by the weight you lift or the visibility of your abs. I may not be as physically “strong” as I was in 2017 but I’m fitter in other ways. My cardiovascular capacity has gone through the roof. I can do 20 burpees without stopping. I can run a 5km on a whim. I can smash a savage @barrysuk class on a weekend. Oh and not to mention, my body can bounce back from massive abdominal surgery pretty sharpish! 😝 And most importantly? I LOVE the way I’m training at the moment. I love the way my body feels. It feels strong, it feels fast and it feels resilient 🙌🏼 ➡️ I’ve come to realise that fitness ebbs and flows, how you train evolves over time and how you measure your strength should evolve with it. There is no one correct way to be fit, there is just the way that works for YOU at that time in your life. So stop comparing yourself to others and to your past self, and start enjoying the journey 🙏🏼💙 #fitnessjourney #stronggirls #transformation #gymgirls #girlgains #girlswholift #fitnessblogger #badassscar
user_14;user_14191.jpg;Sustainable Food Choices 🌍💙 I often talk about the benefits of adopting a more plant focused diet for the planet. But there are so many other ways you can consume consciously when it comes to food 🌱 For example: ➡️ Choosing organic when possible. ➡️ Choosing less plastic & 100% recyclable packaging. ➡️ Choosing local produce from family farms. ➡️ Eating seasonally and avoiding air freight produce when possible. ➡️ Shopping at sources which give a fair deal to farmers. ➡️ Avoiding palm oil when you can. ➡️ Reducing food waste. The reason #IChoose @riverford produce boxes is because they ticks ALL the above boxes! They are an easy way to do my bit for the planet ✅ Plus they collect your box and reuse it again and again for future customers ♻️ [ad] Our food choices are an easy way to take a direct form of positive action three times a day.

user_14;user_14195.jpg;GUYS... @staywildswim is going to LONDON FASHION WEEK!!! 🥳🤩 I can’t quite believe that not even one year after launching our lil sustainable swimwear brand, we are officially exhibiting at @Londonfashionweek as part of the @britishfashioncouncil positive fashion womenswear showcase 😱 As such a teeny tiny brand who puts the planet at the heart of everything we do, we are SO grateful for the support of the @britishfashioncouncil 🙏🏼 This is an incredible opportunity for us to share our message and ethos with a wider audience and really be a part of positive change in the industry 🙌🏼🌍 We aren’t a typical fashion brand in the slightest, we do things our own way. We design everything ourselves, craft our pieces out of regenerated ocean plastic and have them handmade in London. You guys choose our colours, name our styles and even model for our campaigns. We don’t do traditional “seasons”, we release new designs when we think they’re needed, not when the industry tells us we should. We don’t photoshop bodies, we make small production runs to minimise wasteage, we believe in buying less and buying better, we believe that the future is in creating products that put people and the planet first. In short, we do our best and we always strive to do even better ♻️ This is a real “pinch me” moment in our @staywildswim journey and I can’t wait for next week - bring on 5 days of LFW fun! 💃❤️ #londonfashionweek #staywildswim #sustainablefashion #ethicalfashion
