user_29;user_298.jpg;We need to keep on educating ourselves so we better know how to show our love , support and understanding ❤️Please Tag your favourite accounts / influencers below that are sharing useful information ! #blacklivesmatter
user_29;user_299.jpg;I am learning more and more everyday and I urge you to do the same. It’s not enough to consider yourself non racist , you have to be anti racist. Educate yourself as I am trying the best to do and see how you can try make a difference to help make change in this world. It’s mind blowing the information that is out there and right under our noses everyday that I know I have also not been paying a close enough eye to. I hope there is a day where we are all seen as one equal human race and not categorised by our gender, race, skin colour, sexuality. #blacklivesmatter
user_29;user_2910.jpg;#blackouttuesday
user_29;user_2911.jpg;Sometimes you have to be your own motivation. You have the be the one to decide today is day one and not go on in life thinking one day you’ll wake up and start treating yourself right. You don’t have to go crazy but you have to start somewhere. Eating healthy and working out is more than just aesthetics- sure they are a big part in the motivation but my god the confidence, the mental and physical benefits that exercise and healthy eating have given me are more than the aesthetics alone could give. There’s something about self love that just changes your life. I’m not saying you have to be in shape to love yourself but what I am saying is that you should love yourself enough to take care of yourself. This can be making a healthy breakfast and going a walk. It doesn’t have to be a six pack and protein shakes. Frankly I love the gym and healthy food and I can’t imagine not living the lifestyle I live but hello dessert and lazy Sundays doing absolutely nothing. Find what works for you, find your balance and find what you love about yourself in the process💛
user_29;user_2912.jpg;Finally a new blog recipe! Easy Peasy breakfast cookies! Naturallystefanie.com ✌🏼🍪 #vegan
user_29;user_2913.jpg;There is no right thing to say here but I feel it wrong to say nothing. Especially with 400k people reading what i share. It saddens me to think that people are treated unequal based on their skin colour, their religion, their sexuality , their gender. It has to stop. There are no perfect words but say something. Anything to show your support, your stance against racism and to help fight for what is right. Be the change you wish to see in the world. #blacklivesmatter

user_29;user_29134.jpg;AD| I get tons of questions about my skin and products I am using to keep it clean and breakout free - here is the answer. My go-to skincare device for months now is LUNA mini 2 and I am always using it after working out to remove the sweat and dead skin cells off my face. It offers you different levels of pulsations, you can apply your cleanser on the brush or on the face and just do circular motions. The feeling when using it is great cuz it's also a nice massage treatment. Check it out on their page!

I wear a size small in this shorts, bra and crop top. I LOVE high waisted flex, as you know I was not a fan of the original flex as the waistband was too low but the high waisted launch is by far one of my favourite sets to date. Contour lines on the butt, thick squat proof fabric, minimal branding on the front and a party in the back. The seamless range is also releasing so please stick around to the end of the video for the last two outfits; the green is my absolute fave!
