user_22;user_220.jpg;Best bit about a full day in the kitchen yesterday is leftovers today 🌱 Super easy, wonderfully simple red lentil dahl, a one pot staple in our house, with coconut yoghurt and brown rice - creamy, spicy, rich, flavoursome and a winner every time. The best kind of batch cooking recipe, it takes five minutes to prep and it’s just as easy to make enough for 5 meals as it is for one, so you can pop it in the fridge or freezer for another day. In the big batch chapter of Quick and Easy, which launches two weeks today ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_221.jpg;Fudgy brownies, apple blackberry crumble heaven 🥰 These beauties have now launched into @sainsburys - which is a very exciting step for us! As with everything we do they’re all natural, vegan and gf. You’ll also find them in the freezers of @tescofood @wholefoodsuk @planetorganic and soon to be Waitrose.com and very soon the cookies will come and join them both in some of these retailers 🥳 Thank you for continuing to support our company, we can’t tell you how much it means ❤️
user_22;user_222.jpg;One growing bump, one bowl of leftover tomato miso risotto made extra creamy with coconut milk 🥰 Not sure how much of the bump is baby at this point - half banana bread, risotto, dahl, peanut butter and all the rest of the recipe testing and half baby 😋 This is the perfect dinner after a long day cooking though, feels so good. Another recipe from our Quick and Easy book from the shoot today ❤️
user_22;user_223.jpg;This might look simple but it’s my fave DE recipe, possibly ever. It’s the one I’ve made most in the last year or so and I’m fully addicted. The kale goes so soft, the dressing coats everything in a tangy, extra creamy layer of deliciousness, the croutons are rubbed with garlic, the seeds are crunchy with lovely hints of cumin, the avo gives even more creaminess and the mushrooms add a fab meatiness. It’s heaven. It’s in the 10-15 minute section of Quick and Easy and I can’t wait for it to become your #1 too! Half price link to order the book in our bio ❤️

user_22;user_227.jpg;Happy Father’s Day, my angel 🥰 Exceptionally grateful to this amazing dad, husband and all round life partner. The calmest, kindest, most optimistic, brilliant guy around and a truly unbelievable dad to Skye. They’re the best of friends - her first - and only word is dada, and his chest is her #1 place. Watching them each day fills my heart ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_228.jpg;Found these beauties on my phone from the weekend, brightening up a grey Friday 🥰 About to head into the third trimester of this pregnancy, honestly I’m completely exhausted at the moment and slightly feeling like I’ve been pregnant for about one hundred years at this point because the girls are so close together, it’s the blessing of all blessings but some days it feels like a lot - the peeing all night, finding it hard to get comfy to sleep, always worrying if you’ve felt enough kicks, exhaustion, strange cravings and aversions (not ideal if you work in food 😂), reflux, indigestion, aches and pains and so on. Being a mama is the best thing that ever happened to me and the idea of having two girlies that can grow up together is genuine heaven, we keep telling Skye that she’s going to be the best big sister ever. I wouldn’t change a single thing about life right now, that being said honesty around pregnancy is so needed because I think I’ve felt that glowing pregnancy vibe for about a 24 hours both times and was so surprised first time around by how many random symptoms come with growing a baby - at the moment I feel like I’ve got 3-4 hours of energy in the morning and then it’s 😴😴😴😴 P.S v grateful for @sweatybetty making me feel so comfy and sending me a few gorgeous bits and pieces last week, feels so nice to have something lovely and new to wear as I grow and grow and this hoody is 🥰🥰🥰
user_22;user_229.jpg;A spiced potato cake recipe for you tonight, so delicious with garlicky tomatoes. I fry the garlicky tomatoes in the spice pan I’ve used for the potatoes once the cakes are in the oven ❤️ - 750g Maris piper potatoes - 2 red chillies - 2 cloves garlic - 1 teaspoon paprika - 1 teaspoon cumin - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper - 1 tablespoon plain flour - handful of fresh coriander - 1/2 lime - olive oil - salt and pepper Peel, chop and boil the potatoes until soft, about 25 minutes, then drain and let cool. Next, sauté the chopped chillies and garlic with a little olive oil and salt for a couple of minutes before stirring through and gentle toasting the spices. Mash the potatoes and stir the garlic spice mix through along with the chopped coriander, lime juice, flour, salt and pepper. Shape into about 8 patties, then fry for a minute or so on each side so that they go a little golden before baking for about 25 minutes, flipping half way through 🌱

user_22;user_2213.jpg;Lentil Bolognese 🌱 Such a simple way to get loads of veggies and fibre in, a dream batch cooking recipe too - make loads and then use some in a jacket potato later in the week. Here’s how to do it ❤️ Ingredients - 1 onion, peeled and chopped - 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped - 2 carrots, finely sliced - 2 tablespoons of tomato puree - 2 sticks of celery, finely chopped - 1 red pepper, cut into chunks - 1 packet of mushrooms (about 250g), sliced - 200g dry green lentils - x2 400g cans of tinned tomatoes - 500ml water with one stock cub - 250g pasta (I use brown rice pasta) - 1 teaspoon of dried oregano - 1 teaspoon of dried thyme - Olive oil - Salt and pepper to taste Method Place the olive oil into a large pan with the chopped onion, garlic and celery, plus salt and pepper. Let this soften then add the carrots, mushrooms and red pepper and cook for 5-10 minutes until soft. Add about half the water (with the stock mixed in) and the herbs, then add the tomato puree, tinned tomatoes and lentils. Continue to add the remaining water as it cooks. Let it simmer for 30-40 minutes, until the lentils are really soft. Just before it finishes cooking, make the pasta. Once the lentils are ready, stir the cooked (and drained) pasta through.
user_22;user_2214.jpg;Anyone else finding themselves a bit stuck with working from home lunch ideas everyday? 🤷🏻‍♀️ We’ve been doing quite a lot of speedy sandwiches using delicious dips - artichoke and cannellini bean, smashed chickpeas (our vegan take on a classic tuna mayo), harissa hummus, roasted garlic and chive, sun-dried tomato and cashew and lots more.

A few minutes later add the cooked sweet potato and toss them to make sure they're coated, cook for five minutes then add the black beans and lime juice. Finally add the tinned tomatoes and simmer on a low heat for about fifteen minutes, adding a splash of water if needed 🌱
user_22;user_2220.jpg;Working from home lunches, keeping them speedy but delicious with this quinoa, red onion, tomato and pesto salad. Big batches of pesto make the world of difference, we use it on everything.

user_22;user_2221.jpg;Easy Monday meal - roast veggie and chickpea stew. Make a big batch and keep the rest for later in the week or pop it in the freezer for a busy day.

user_22;user_2222.jpg;Happy Monday everyone ❤️ Human kindness feels like an important topic at the moment and in our last podcast episode, we’re talking the importance of believing in human goodness and all the reasons why we should see each other as fundamentally kind, altruistic people. There’s also the most fascinating case study in there about the real life Lord of the Flies, which is the polar opposite of the book, it shows companionship and peace yet we don’t talk about it. Lots of food for thought. On iTunes, Acast, Spotify etc now and I’ll pop a link in our stories too ❤️
user_22;user_2223.jpg;Simple Sunday night dinner idea 🥰 Roast a sweet potato for about an hour to an hour and a half, making sure to pierce it before cooking to stop it exploding, then just as the outside is going crispy and then inside is lovely and soft, add a few big handfuls of kale to the baking tray. Then quickly drain a tin of lentils (one tin would serve two), toss them with a little olive oil, lemon juice, capers, chilli flakes, fresh parsley, sea salt and black pepper then once the kale is crispy pile it all inside the potato with loads of tahini - I add about six times as much as you see here in the end 😂🥰
user_22;user_2224.jpg;Like millions and millions of people around the world, witnessing the hideous events in the US this past week, I feel lost for words. I feel a burning sense of responsibility to add something of value to this huge moment, yet I am left feeling I don’t have the solutions to offer. But I realise that is not what this moment is about. It’s not about having the answers right now, it’s about declaring a proactive and total commitment to be a part of the collective action we must all commit to for as long as it takes. Which starts now. On behalf of myself, my family and our business, we stand in solidarity and will also be taking a pause on our social media this week to create space for this conversation #blacklivesmatter

user_22;user_2226.jpg;Hello 29 👋 celebrating with my faves 🥰❤️
user_22;user_2227.jpg;I’ve been wanting to master sourdough for the last year and finally getting stuck into the project. Can’t tell you how happy I was with this guy, lots more to learn but he tastes SO good, by a mile my best yet. Any tips and tricks? Would love to hear, I’m really wanting to learn more and such a newbie in this area. This was 75g starter (I got my bread mother from my real mother) with 350ml room temperature water, whisked together, then mixed with 500g white bread flour and 10g of salt. I left it in the loaf tin overnight with a damp cloth on top then baked it at 230C for 50 minutes, the first 30 with an upside down loaf tin as a hat and the second 20 without anything on top ❤️ P.S I was a bit scared of making a round one, that looks harder, which is why I stuck with the loaf tin first but that’ll be my next step 🙏🏼
user_22;user_2228.jpg;Obsessed with dips this week, dips and crackers - such a win ❤️🥰 This one is below and served with our best crackers! 200g plain yoghurt (we use coconut yogurt) 1 tablespoon of smooth tahini 4 roasted garlic cloves, crushed Zest and juice of one lemon Handful of chopped chives Handful of chopped parsley Handful of chopped coriander Salt and pepper

user_22;user_2230.jpg;A few days off with my best pal and growing bump. Skye’s been up at 5am everyday and teething all week but it’s been heaven, utter bliss to just be able to focus solely on her and not be trying to juggle as much - there’s always a feeling of being torn between the two so getting a few quiet days just to be a mama really is so special 🥰🥰🥰 We’re 22 weeks now with her sister, I’m feeling pretty good, way more energy than Skye and I’m finding pregnancy much easier in many ways under the current climate - not commuting, being able to sit really comfortably while I work at home and not getting so hot and sweaty rushing around is truly making each week so much more enjoyable and comfortable than it felt last summer. If she’s anything like her sister we’ll be meeting her pretty soon too, in about 16 weeks time. Not the year we expected in so many ways but genuinely the best it could ever be, these girls just bring us endless sunshine and have a way of allowing us to stay present like nothing I’ve experienced before ❤️
user_22;user_2231.jpg;A little summer salad lunch inspiration 🥰🌱 5 mins, no prep or washing up and so yum! Toss a tin of chickpeas with a big handful of sliced cherry tomatoes, sliced red onion and a couple of spring onions then stir in balsamic, cider vinegar, olive oil and the tiniest splash of maple with a handful of fresh parsley, lots of salt and pepper 🙏🏼 Served with super creamy homemade hummus and a rocket salad. Perfect lunch on a hot working from home kind of day ❤️ We’ll write the full recipe up ASAP and get it on the app too 🙏🏼

user_22;user_2236.jpg;Since I founded Deliciously Ella, one of the things I’ve enjoyed most is getting to meet founders of other businesses within our space who are equally as passionate about making a more natural, plant-based lifestyle easier and more exciting. Often times, like ours, their business had started because of a personal problem they had and in trying to fix it for themselves, they found that many more people were searching for the same thing, and were able to start incredible companies that support us all as a result. All of the products on our new Brands We Love section on our website are products I’ve used for a long time, and you may have seen me using in the past, but behind them are an amazing group of other founders. @bysarahlondon, for example, was founded after Sarah created a completely natural skin care range for her sister, Lauren, who was undergoing treatment in her early 20’s for a rare cancer and the treatment caused a huge number of complications including painfully sensitive skin. After Lauren recovered the sisters decided to share the products with the rest of the world as they’d had such a huge impact on their lives. We’ve used their oils for the past two years and love them. They’re an inspiration to us both, and we feel so lucky to be working with them. Likewise Nicole @selfcarecompany started making her aromatherapy candles as a therapy for her depression and anxiety, what started as a personal project from the darkest place led to the most beautiful company. We so hope you’ll enjoy our new webshop, which has all of our food products, alongside a selection of amazing products from these brands we love, plus @evolvebeautyuk (this is their amazing face mask) @naturaldeoco @blackblumdesign ❤️ Use ELLALOVES for 10% off the whole shop too for the long weekend 🙏🏼 P.S Skye thought the mask was SO funny 😂
user_22;user_2237.jpg;So excited to bring you this - the start of collating all the natural brands we love and use everyday in one place. My go-to facemasks, beauty products, candles, lunchboxes and so much more, all from incredible brands who are equally as passionate about making natural living a little easier and more exciting. Have a look now on www.user_22.com and to celebrate we’ve got 10% off everything, including all our own products, and free shipping across Europe all weekend with ELLALOVES ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_2238.jpg;My all time #1 salad 🥰 Been making this since day one of Deliciously Ella and it was the first recipe in my first ever cooking class, my mum and I have made it religiously ever since - the magic is in giving the kale a good, firm massage!

Next up is a peanut butter and raspberry jam slice, it’s my current pregnancy addiction 🙏🏼

user_22;user_2247.jpg;As with so many other businesses coronavirus has definitely created its fair share of stress and disruption for us and changed so many plans from pausing our American and German product launches to closing the deli and moving the date of our book launch. We’ve had to set up a web shop in a week to create a new channel to share our products with you from, as so many stockists closed and others we couldn’t get stock into for weeks at a time - it’s been a learning curve to say the least but we’re so proud of where we are today and so grateful for your ongoing support and I’m so happy to have some good news to share today - we now have a confirmed date for our book, Quick and Easy, 9th July! If you’ve already ordered the book then it’ll arrive with you on that date and if you haven’t ordered it yet then it’s half price on Waterstones at the moment and they even have a few signed copies for you at that price (amazon also have copies at half price but trying to support the high st as much as we can!) Today I started the process of signing 7,000 beautiful stickers to go in the signed books we had already promised you, my hand is a teeny bit numb, but I think they’ll look great - I’m sadly not allowed to go to the warehouse to sign them for you but I so hope you’ll be happy with this - all the love and effort is there in spades❤️❤️❤️❤️

Cook on one side for 3-4 minutes until golden, before turning and cooking on the other side for 2-3 minutes. Repeat until the pancake mixture is finished. Simple Pancakes

user_22;user_2255.jpg;Creamy cashew mushroom pasta - just 15 minutes from start to finish! Here's the recipe... For the vegan mushroom pasta: • 1 red onion • 2 cloves garlic • 2 sticks celery • 250g mushrooms • a big handful of spinach • Frozen peas • A handful of fresh basil For the creamy cashew sauce • 200g roasted cashews • Pinch cayenne pepper (optional) • 2 teaspoons of nutritional yeast • 200-300ml of oat milk (depending on how thick you want the sauce to be) • 1 teaspoon of tamari • 1/2 a lemon • salt and pepper  Method Blend all of the ingredients for the sauce and place to one side. Finely chop the onion, garlic and celery and add them to a large frying pan with the dried thyme, a sprinkling of salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Let this cook for 5-10 minutes until they've softened. While that cooks slice the mushrooms and put the pasta on to cook.  Add the mushrooms and the peas to the frying pan. Let these cook for a few minutes before adding the spinach and basil, stirring them in and letting the spinach wilt. Pour the sauce in, let it warm up and then add the pasta, mixing it all together before serving with a sprinkling of thyme on the top.
user_22;user_2256.jpg;Lunch today 🥰🌱 Jacket sweet potatoes with harissa chickpeas, a little coriander, fresh chilli and coconut yogurt 🙏🏼 The chickpeas are one of my fave recipes, I did the recipe for our newsletter a few months ago and you’ll find them now on our app - I just skipped the roasted tomatoes from the recipe as we didn’t have any ❤️
user_22;user_2257.jpg;Nine months with our girl 🥰 As long out in the world as she spent cooking in my belly. I did think that I’d be feeling physically fitter and stronger at this point, in reality my hips are agony and those pregnancy aches and pains are coming in thick and fast this time around, but mentally Skye and her sister-to-be are pure magic. She’s made us more present, more grounded, more grateful and given us an even greater sense of purpose in each day and we cannot wait for her to become a big sister in five months time 🥰❤️
user_22;user_2258.jpg;Hello Apple and blackberry crumble 👋🏻 This was one of the first recipes I ever made for Deliciously Ella back in 2012, my mum and I made it together, picking blackberries on a walk and trying new ways of making the topping sweet, crunchy and delicious while keeping it vegan and gf. The recipe then went into our first book, it’s on the app and it’s been such a favourite with everyone over the last eight years or so, so it felt like the right friend for our fudgy frozen brownies ❤️ It’s just arrived into @wholefoodsuk with more places coming this month 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

user_22;user_2261.jpg;Who’s made our magic, ultimate chocolate chip cookies yet? We are OBSESSED 😋 Five mins to make, ten mins to bake, heaven to eat! Top tip: mix the dough by hand, makes all the difference and don’t swap the plain flour for another type flour - coconut flour has sadly ruined these for a few readers, it’s SO drying and therefore changes the consistency completely ❤️ Recipe on the app, Android and iPhone 🌱 P.S for those asking, you need an android 8 or above to run the app 😘
user_22;user_2262.jpg;We’ve been making this simple salad a few times a week, it’s such a favourite. New potatoes, asparagus and avocado tossed with rocket, a little tahini and lime. The dream with a bowl of hummus on the side 🌱❤️ On the app ❤️
user_22;user_2263.jpg;It's pouring with rain in London so this feels like a perfect recipe for today. Sweet potato shepherd’s pie with black beans, red onion, mushrooms, garlic and spring onions.

Super speedy to put together but feels fancy! To make chia jam, just simmer frozen berries with a splash of water until soft, then add the chia seeds and let them expand and thicken the jam for 10-15 minutes, you can leave as it is or add a splash of maple/coconut sugar to sweeten. Then leave to cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge ❤️

user_22;user_2273.jpg;"Feel like I’m a bit late to the party on this one, seems baking banana bread is a must right now, so here’s our fave version. It’s from The Plant-Based Cookbook and it’s 🥰🥰🥰 We had it at the deli for years and it’s definitely in my top 5 Deliciously Ella recipes: 430g ripe, peeled bananas (about 4 bananas) 20g pecans, halved 150g ground almonds 125g buckwheat flour 190ml maple syrup 55ml chickpea water (from a tin of chickpeas) 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Pinch of salt - Preheat the oven to 190oC (fan 170oC). Line a 23 × 13 × 7cm loaf tin with baking parchment. - Put the bananas into a mixing bowl and mash with a fork until smooth and creamy – the riper they are the easier this will be. - Next stir in the dry ingredients, mixing them well with the bananas. Then add the wet ingredients and stir until a smooth batter forms. - Spoon the mixture into the lined loaf tin, then sprinkle the pecan halves over the top evenly. - Bake the loaf in the oven for 45–50 minutes or until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean; if it doesn’t leave the loaf in the oven a little longer. - Once ready, leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes to firm up, before transferring to a wire rack to cool to room temperature."

user_22;user_2276.jpg;Sunny Fridays at home 😎😎😎 Makes 10 pancakes * 400ml almond or oat milk * 300g self-raising flour (we use gf) * 50g porridge oats * 2 tablespoon coconut oil, melted (plus more for the pan) * 1 teaspoon chia seeds * 1 tablespoon maple syrup * 1 teaspoon baking powder * Optional: 100g dark chocolate Stir all of the pancake ingredients together to form a smooth, thick batter.

Once warm, spoon in a large tablespoon of pancake batter into the pan, using a wooden spoon to spread out the mixture.

Now available on amazon - link in our stories 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 All natural, as always, plant-based deliciousness.

user_22;user_2281.jpg;Crunchy Mini Eggs for you today ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Makes about 30 mini eggs  4 tablespoons maple syrup 150g cacao butter 2 tablespoons coconut oil 9 tablespoons cacao powder 1 tablespoon almond butter 150g roasted buckwheat groats Place the maple syrup, cacao butter, cacao powder, coconut oil and almond butter in a pan over a low heat. Once melted, remove from the heat and stir through the buckwheat groats. Pour the mixture into the egg moulds and leave to set in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Tips: We used 3cm x 2cm x 1cm mini egg moulds for this recipe, but you can use whatever size you like best and fill them up until the mixture runs out. If you're toasting your own buckwheat groats, simply place them in a dry pan over a medium heat and cook, constantly stirring, for roughly 10-15 minutes until they turn golden.
user_22;user_2282.jpg;Simple scones for Easter baking ❤️🥰 Makes 12 scones  300g oat flour 150g plain flour (we use gluten-free flour) 200ml almond milk 200ml maple syrup 50g coconut oil, melted (plus extra for lining the muffin tray) 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon bicarb Preheat the oven to 180C (350F), fan setting. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with coconut oil.  In a large bowl, mix together both flours, bicarb and spices until there are no lumps.  Once combined, add the maple syrup, melted coconut oil and almond milk and mix until a batter has formed.  Pour the mixture into the muffin holes and bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden. To test whether they’re ready, put a knife into the middle of one scone, if it comes out clean they’re ready, if not place them back into the oven for 5 more minutes.  Once cooked, leave the scones to cool for at least 10 minutes in their tins to firm up, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling or serve warm.

We’re asking psychotherapist @annamathur how we can manage the huge shifts and monumental changes we’re dealing with across the world right now, how we can find joy and keep our sense of self when the way we define ourselves and our everyday has shifted so drastically and so quickly. Most importantly looking at how we can reframe the uncertainty and anxiety that so many of us our feeling.

user_22;user_2290.jpg;A twenty minute, one pan sun-dried tomato chickpea recipe 🌱 I just made this for us for lunch and it’s 🥰 You’ll need an onion, 6 big cloves of garlic, 2 tins of chickpeas, some sun-dried and cherry tomatoes, frozen or fresh spinach, lemon juice, tomato purée, tinned tomatoes, some yogurt if you have it and some toast or rice to serve ❤️ Here’s the rough recipe: Sauté your onion and garlic with salt and olive oil until soft, then add the roughly chopped sun-dried tomato and quartered cherry tomatoes, let them get nice and hot then stir through the drained chickpeas and tinned tomatoes with a spoon of tomato puree. Let them cook for about ten minutes, then stir through the spinach until it wilts, a squeeze of lemon and finally stir through a couple of spoons of yoghurt to make it extra creamy at the end.

user_22;user_2293.jpg;Creamy, herby, lemony mushrooms on sourdough 🥳🥳🥳
user_22;user_2294.jpg;Dinner tonight sorted 🌱 Easy mushroom risotto, 🥰  1 onion 4 cloves of garlic 3 sticks of celery 400g risotto rice 500g mushrooms, I’ve been using a mix of mushrooms as they’re in season now 15g dried porcini mushrooms 1 mushroom stock cube with 1 later of water 1 bag of spinach 1 lemon 2 heaped tablespoons of nutritional yeast Finely dice the onion, garlic and celery Place them into a large saucepan with a big glut of olive oil and lots of salt and pepper. Let them sauté, until soft, for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Boil the kettle and pour 1 litre of boiling water into a measuring jug with the stock cube and the dried mushrooms (you want the mushrooms to soak for about twenty minutes, so just hold them back with a wooden spoon as you start to add the stock mix and add those towards the end). Stir the rice through the garlic, onion and celery for a minute or so, letting it soak up the flavours then add a little stock, stirring it through. Keep stirring the rice as it cooks, adding more stock gradually. Finely slice half the mushrooms, add them to a large frying pan with salt and olive oil and sauté. Ten minutes or so before the rice is cooked, add the sliced mushrooms. Then cut the other half of the mushrooms into big chunks (I normally half or quarter them) and sauté. Stir the lemon juice, spinach and nutritional yeast into the risotto once it’s cooked, adding more salt and pepper if needed, then top each bowl with the mushrooms from the frying pan

user_22;user_22102.jpg;Making magic with a tin of sweetcorn 🙏🏼🌱 If anyone is looking at their store cupboard ingredients and thinking 🤔 then I hope we can keep giving you some inspiration. Let me know if it’s helpful 🙋🏻‍♀️ Serves 2: * X2 200g cans sweetcorn, drained * Dash of almond milk (or oat milk) * 1 onion, peeled and chopped * 3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped * 2 carrots (or sweet potatoes), peeled and cut into very small pieces * 3 teaspoons harissa paste * 1 vegetable stock cube, mixed with 400ml boiling water * 1 teaspoon paprika * Olive oil * Salt Place a pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Once warm, add the onions, garlic, carrots (or sweet potatoes) and a pinch of salt, and cook for 10 minutes until soft. Once soft, add the drained sweetcorn and paprika and cook for a further 2 minutes, before adding the harissa paste and stock. Bring to the boil, before reducing to a simmer - leave to cook for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, add all of the soup ingredients into a blender or food processor and pulse until smooth - you may want to add a dash of almond milk until you reach the consistency you like best.

user_22;user_22105.jpg;I’m very sorry to say that sadly in light of the current situation it feels like delaying the launch of Quick and Easy is the best thing to do. It’s not a decision that we took lightly but it feels like the safest decision for everyone. We wouldn’t have been able to sign the signed books you’d bought, we wouldn’t be able to support local and high street stores due to the closures and getting deliveries looks increasingly challenging too, not to mention getting the required ingredients. Most importantly though we want to support everyone staying at home and we collectively felt that launching a book at this point could challenge that in different ways. I’m so sorry to let everyone down and really hope you understand and are able to enjoy it later this year. It will now publish on the 20th August and anyone who has already ordered the book will receive their copy then, and we’re so grateful for your support for the book already. The really sad news though is that we do have to cancel the book tour, something I’m devastated about, especially after all the time and energy everyone put into organising it. As I’ll be eight months pregnant at this point I won’t be able to tour the country and so we felt the only thing we could do was to cancel it, and we promise it’ll come back bigger and better next time. All ticket holders will be contacted directly by the venue in regards to refunding the ticket. Please do bear with them as venue box offices are under huge pressure and are so busy sorting out thousands of people in the same situation and will so appreciate your patience xxx
user_22;user_22106.jpg;Skye’s going to be a big sister 🥰 We’re feeling so lucky to hold on to something so special while the world feels so topsy turvy, and whilst of course it’s a little unnerving to be navigating pregnancy in this climate, we are just so incredibly grateful ❤️ Like everyone else, we’re staying quietly at home, taking Austin and Skye our for a little daily walk on our own, which this morning was the quietest and emptiest I’ve ever seen London. Sending so much love to you all 🥰
user_22;user_22107.jpg;Black beans are one of my absolute fave store cupboard ingredients.

She’s the biggest blessing I could ask for and is bringing such sunshine to us in these uncertain times. She’s given me such appreciation of what women all over the world have given their children for centuries and in doing so really deepened my gratitude for my mum and everything she’s done for her children. Most importantly though she has helped to heal her dad’s broken heart because she looks and feels so like his extraordinary mum and that’s just everything 😘😘😘

user_22;user_22112.jpg;Little recipe to brighten your day 🥰  Dark chocolate & apricot flapjacks Makes 1 small tray of flapjacks, for larger flapjacks simply double the quantities For the flapjack base * 400g dried apricots * 100g desiccated coconut * 100g pumpkin seeds * 100g oats (jumbo or porridge) * 2 tablespoons maple syrup For the topping * 100g dark chocolate, or more depending how chocolatey you like it * Handful of coconut chips * Handful of dried apricots, chopped Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place all of the flapjack ingredients into a food processor and pulse until the mixture comes together to form a sticky, thick mixture - you still want some bigger chunks in the mixture so don’t leave it too long. Spoon the mixture into the lined baking tray and press down, ensuring to even the mixture out. Place in the fridge for at least an hour to set. Melt the dark chocolate over a low heat and stir until fully melted. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the flapjack base and sprinkle with coconut chips and dried apricot pieces. Place back in the fridge for another hour before cutting into equal shaped bars.

user_22;user_22114.jpg;The strongest trees are the ones that can bend with the wind, the ones that get knocked over are rigid and sold and who don’t have the flexibility to move with what’s thrown at them. A gorgeous quote from today’s podcast on embracing life’s challenges and losses. We recorded it before we knew this is where we’d be today and how we’d all be feeling, feels very timely though and I hope it helps ❤️❤️❤️ On Acast, Spotify, iTunes etc - it’s free to listen too 🥰 Our guest is the lovely @sashbates and her book is Languages of Loss ❤️
user_22;user_22115.jpg;Five ingredient peanut butter smoothie to celebrate our new peanut butter bars 🥰 1 banana (even better if it’s frozen, makes it extra creamy), 1 heaped tablespoon of peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of porridge oats, almond/oat milk and 1 tablespoon of hemp seeds (optional) ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_22116.jpg;So pleased to share some good news today! Our peanut oat bars are now available in @waitroseandpartners free from aisle, @marksandspencer, @wholefoodsuk, @planetorganic and coming ASAP to @ocadouk and @amazon 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Vegan, so delicious and such a nice, easy snack 🥳
user_22;user_22117.jpg;We’re so sorry to say that sadly we’ve had to pause our American and German launches that were scheduled for the next month. Last week was full of tough decisions our end, we were printing packaging, all the ground work had been done, flights booked and plans made, but it’s simply not the right thing to do now for a hundred different reasons. In the grand scheme of what’s happening in the world it’s of course completely irrelevant, literally the last thing that matters - what really matters is keeping as many people as possible safe and healthy, supporting our doctors, nurses and hospitals and keeping as positive as we can. Whilst it was something we were so excited about as a company and have put so much in to, it’ll just be something that we can put even more into later down the line and as soon as we can be there we will. Thank you again for everyone’s support ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_22118.jpg;Family time 🥰 Holding on to all the good stuff this week. We were making some mushrooms on toast (our fave) yesterday morning when we got a surprise call from David Potts, the CEO of @morrisons. He let us know about their plans to support small businesses like ours by paying us immediately for stock we deliver to them to help with cash flow. With so much uncertainty, fear and heartbreak in the world at the moment, it reminded us how much goodness surrounds us too. Now having a walk in the park and soaking up every second. So hope you’re all able to find some times of joy this weekend too xx

Supporting small business is so important at the moment and we so appreciate everything you do for us at Deliciously Ella. And to make us all feel better this morning, here is our fave little gal having the best ever breakfast 😂😂😂
user_22;user_22124.jpg;We’re really sad to say that we’ll be temporarily closing our deli. It’s been a very tough week, and making decisions like this is the worst part of running a business, but we’ve seen a substantial drop in trade in a very short period of time due to concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, and it's impossible for us to keep operating in this climate. I’m sure many of you are feeling the challenge at work too, and we send our love and best thoughts to all of you. Most of all, we send support and endless gratitude to all of our doctors, nurses, and those in the most infected areas. While we all go through these changes and uncertainties in the world, we’ll do everything in our power to keep bringing you plant-based deliciousness and trying to raise all of our spirits in any way we can. Our snacking, breakfast and frozen ranges will continue to be stocked with all of our great retail partners around the UK, and we’ll keep updating our app with new recipes, yoga videos, and meditations. We can’t wait to see our customers back in our deli soon. Thank you so much for all of your support xxxx

user_22;user_22126.jpg;Speedy breakfast on a very busy week. Our Bircher muesli with coconut milk topped with raspberries and some raspberry chia jam, almonds and mulberries. I made Skye yoghurt, mashed raspberries and peanut butter for breakfast, which was a huge hit! The muesli takes just 1-2 minutes to get soft and creamy, as we mill the oats so finely, perfect for a week like this 💃💃💃 It’s stocked one loads of places - boots, Waitrose, Ocado, Sainsbury’s (free from aisle), whole foods, planet organic ❤️

user_22;user_22128.jpg;Anyone else feeling 🤯😢😳 this morning? Today’s podcast is for you. We’re talking about the simple things that can impact our brains and our stress levels and getting outside is one of those things. The science behind time in nature is truly mind blowing. We’re asking whether our cultural move away from the natural world impacts our mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing? Does it really change things in our brains, guts and our ability to heal? What does the science say? Our guest is the science journalist @lucyfjones – who has been looking at the most recent studies on our relationship with nature and how it interacts with human biology, neuroscience and psychology, as well the impact of pollution and the concept of eco-anxiety and how our disconnect from nature impacts on climate change. Can’t wait to hear what you think! iTunes link in our bio, but it’s also on Spotify, Acast etc. This was on holiday last month, utter bliss 🥰🥰🥰🥰
user_22;user_22129.jpg;This weeks new recipe - quick green pasta 🌱 Super creamy blend of cashews, avocado, chives and garlic make a speedy, heavenly sauce, then toss with sunflower seeds, fresh rocket and black pepper. So quick, so good. On our app now, link in our bio ❤️
user_22;user_22130.jpg;"International women’s day 💃 This is baby me, just after my first book came out, so overwhelmed by my new career, getting ready for book two and truly totally unaware of what was to come. The people that got me to this point, that took a chance on Deliciously Ella and that encouraged me to keep trying were all women: a brilliant literary agent I emailed and who agreed to take on the project; a passionate editor that saw something in my book proposal and commissioned book #1; my now life long friend Annie who was our first team member and who took a chance on this as a first job; my mum who encouraged me every single step of the way, tried everything and constantly offered feedback and support. The women that came to my first cooking classes and gave such warm feedback, those that then came to the first supper clubs and talks and made me feel that this business had room to grow. Those that reached out and said they loved the recipes and then the products. You have no idea what each message, what each sign of encouragement, meant and still means. It’s the fuel behind all of this. I had no idea how much support I needed in my career, I had no idea I could even have this kind of career, I had never aimed this high for myself and none of it would have happened without brilliant brilliant women. I’m endlessly grateful for every women I’ve met along the way, for all of you and all of the other female entrepreneurs that encouraged, collaborated with and supported me, and now for the brilliant women leading Deliciously Ella, expanding the mission and growing the plant-based dream everyday. Becoming a mum has created an even deeper level of sisterhood for me, the woman that found my crying in the park the first time I went out on my own with Skye, my new baby friends who give such consistent support and every person that so generously lends a hand. Women are amazing, just phenomenal, but we can also be cruel to one another in a way that raises no one up. Women need to support women, always, that’s how change happens. No more judging, no more unnecessary critiquing, no more gossiping - everyone is just doing their best and being kind will take us all so much further ❤️❤️"
user_22;user_22131.jpg;Good morning 🥰 Our crunchy buckwheat granola, coconut milk and raspberries 🙏🏼 Perfect bowl for a sunny Friday! The granola is available in @waitroseandpartners @Ocadouk @wholefoodsuk
user_22;user_22132.jpg;The only thing I want in my life right now 😍😍😍 Medjool dates, dark chocolate, peanut butter and sea salt. Genuine heaven. Cheers up a rainy day no end - debating making these or melting a bar of dark chocolate for hot chocolate, or both? 🤔😋

user_22;user_22135.jpg;Hello season five of the Deliciously Ella podcast 🥳💥🥰💃 We’re back online and today we’re talking about building a healthy, happy brain. We’re asking whether there psychological and lifestyle factors that impact on our brain’s functioning and therefore our wellbeing? Our guest is @foodandpsych, a psychologist who’s passionate about education on the preventative measures we can take when it comes to brain health. We talk everything from why we ignore mental health symptoms to dementia, depression, anxiety, stress, diet and managing our emotional health. In iTunes, Spotify, Acast, on our app and all the usuals. Can’t wait to hear what you think!! ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_22136.jpg;🥳🥰 If I’m honest this was my biggest challenge yet. I completely and utterly underestimated how hard it would be to write, edit, test, shoot and bring together this book while very pregnant and then with a tiny baby. I went back to work on it four weeks after Skye was born, I couldn’t stop crying that weekend as I realised how much work was ahead, I wasn’t sure I could be a good mum to a tiny and publish a great book, I’ve never doubted myself more or felt more terrified of a project. I was also so torn between soaking up every second of Skye and following through on the business that we’ve worked so hard to create. There’s no perfect way to be a parent, as I’m realising every day, and once I’d started to get the hang of doing both it started to take on a sense of magic, albeit a little stressful at times. Skye came to the book shoots, she slept in the sling on me as we went, I fed in between shots and with the help of the amazing women that worked on this book, we did it. There’s no way I could have done it without them, not in a million years. The book is everything we need healthy, plant based deliciousness to be - it’s practical, it’s doable and it’s delicious. Speedy weeknight meals, lunchboxes, big batch cooking and so much more. I literally just opened the first copy and I’m truly bursting with pride for every second of work the whole team put into this. It was worth every doubt and every second of questioning whether I was doing the right thing. I hope you’ll all adore it too. You can pre-order a copy on Amazon now. It’s currently half price on amazon UK too 🥰 It’ll publish in the UK, the US, Australia and New Zealand on the 14th of May with more countries and translations coming soon after ❤️❤️❤️

user_22;user_22142.jpg;Chocolate chip pancakes 🥞 Fool-proof, speedy and so insanely delicious. Here’s how to make them, and we’ll have them in the deli all day too ❤️ Simple pancakes Makes 10 pancakes * 400ml almond milk * 300g self-raising flour (we use gf) * 50g porridge oats * 2 tablespoon coconut oil, melted (plus more for the pan) * 1 teaspoon chia seeds * 1 tablespoon maple syrup * 1 teaspoon baking powder * Optional: 100g dark chocolate Stir all of the pancake ingredients together to form a smooth, thick batter. If it feels a little thin, leave it to sit for 5-10 minutes.  Chop the chocolate into little chunks, stir it into the batter Warm a tablespoon of coconut oil in a pan over a medium heat. Once warm, spoon in a large tablespoon of pancake batter into the pan, using a wooden spoon to spread out the mixture. Cook on one side for 3-4 minutes until golden, before turning and cooking on the other side for 2-3 minutes. Repeat until the pancake mixture is finished.

user_22;user_22144.jpg;Sunday night ritual 🌱 So far Skye’s fave foods are pesto pasta, almond butter porridge, courgette butter bean fritters, rye toast with nut butter/hummus/avo and little cubes of frozen mango in those mesh chewy holders (no idea what they’re called). This is our Sunday staple though, can’t beat it. Stir a spoonful of coconut yoghurt though (plain, we use coyo) to make it extra creamy 🙏🏼

user_22;user_22156.jpg;Dark chocolate valentines mousses ❤️ So simple, insanely light, fluffy and delicious. They need just four ingredients, but one of them sounds very strange, definitely one where you’ve got to trust us - it works like magic to create that beautiful lightness 👌👌👌 · 300g silken tofu · 200g dark chocolate · 180ml almond milk (or any other plant-based milk) ·  100g fresh raspberries Place the chocolate into a small pan over a low heat and cook until melted, being careful not to overcook and burn the chocolate. Once melted, remove from the heat and leave to cool a little. To make the mousse, place the tofu, melted chocolate and almond milk into a blender (or food processor) and blend until smooth. Once smooth, divide the mixture between 4 glasses, and place in the fridge to set for 4 hours or until ready to serve. Once ready to serve, top with fresh raspberries.
user_22;user_22157.jpg;Peanut butter dressing, sweet potatoes, broccoli and quinoa with sesame seeds 👋🏻 Peanut butter (creamy, unsweetened), olive oil, splash of tamari, drizzle of maple, squeeze of lime and salt for the dressing 👌

user_22;user_22163.jpg;Baked veggie crackers 🥰 We wanted these to be our first ever product before we launched our energy balls back in 2016, but we couldn’t find a way to make them without any preservatives, emulsifiers or frying them. We kept going on the project and four years later we’ve arrived!! Baked, not fried, so crispy and crunchy, all natural, made with chickpea, sweet potato or beet flour. So much more flavour and texture than a rice cracker, so much better for you than a crisp 🌱 We’re really proud of these guys 🙏🏼 They’re in @wholefoodsuk now and more places coming soon!
user_22;user_22164.jpg;Turmeric noodles with garlic, coconut milk, sesame, chill, crispy kale and tofu 🥰 A warming fave from the app 🌱

Bottle for Skye, probiotics, green juice and a coconut coffee with a face mask for mama ❤️ This is the problem solver by @maylindstromskin - I’m obsessed, Matt secretly loves it too. Holly @ondabeautynyc (they’re on Westbourne grove in London) got me onto a really paired back skincare routine and my skin is the best it’s been in about a year as a result 🙏🏼
user_22;user_22166.jpg;Have you ever tried using silken tofu to make a thick, super creamy vegan sauce?

user_22;user_22169.jpg;Monday’s in the office kitchen - trying a new pasta bake 😍😍😍
user_22;user_22170.jpg;There are certain moments with Deliciously Ella that just feel slightly indescribable. I know some of you have been part of this community since the beginning, when there were just a few of us and loving kale and quinoa like we do was wierd 😂 Back then I wrote a blog from my student house and my parents kitchen and would have thought something like this launch was quite literally impossible. Vegan food was wierd, DE was niche and I was a little one man band. Now our breakfast pots are available nationwide @costacoffee - I’ve been to Costa my whole life, we’d get toasties there at the airport and hot chocolate. Launching here is huge for us. We are so proud of this. Here’s a natural, plant-based breakfast that’s easy for on-the-go on every high street in the country. The world has changed a lot in the last eight years since I wrote the first blog post, and to see options like this hit the mainstream in this way is just 🤯🥰💃🥳🤩 We’re over the moon to be a part of this change. Our team worked so hard on making this happen, there are a lot of silent hero’s in our business but it’s them that makes these moments possible. Thank you all and let us know if you see these pots! Berry granola or fruit and nut muesli, which Costa will add plant based milk too. And the whole pot and lid are 100% recyclable too ❤️
user_22;user_22171.jpg;Stewed berry porridge, peanut butter and caramelised bananas 😍 Pan fry the bananas with coconut oil, a pinch of cinnamon and a splash of maple. Simmer the frozen berries with a splash of boiling water and stir through the porridge ❤️
user_22;user_22172.jpg;Creamy herby mushrooms on sourdough 🥰 Sautee onion and garlic with olive oil and salt, until they’re nice and soft, then add the sliced mushrooms with dried thyme and cook until golden, stirring through a spoon of coconut yoghurt with a squeeze of lemon juice and lots of black pepper at the end 🙏🏼 One pan, 10-15 mins, so easy and so good. We’ve got these as a brunch special in the deli today and a more detailed recipe on our app too ❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_22173.jpg;Things Skye likes to do on a Friday. Go to @wholefoodsuk to see our sampling station in the foyer, inspect our window and say hey to the team 😂 Also bumped into her granny who snapped this for us. Life is a million trillion times more fun taking my pal around with me, might be mildly chaotic but we’re currently making friends and drinking our milk on the bus down past green park on our way to a meeting at the office and she cannot wait to see her dad 🥰🥰 we’ll be sampling our cereals and snacks all weekend at high street ken so come say hi 🥰
user_22;user_22174.jpg;One of my promises this year was to find a bit more calm, balance and a second for myself between mum life and work. I thought I’d take January as maternity, as I was back to work after just a few weeks when Skye was born, but so far I’d say it’s a pretty funny attempt at time off - I just love what we do, there are so many exciting plans in motion and I’m finding it impossible to stay away, so my tiny pal is just coming along with me for the ride and so far she seems to be loving it. That being said it can feel a little non-stop, so I’m trying to find little practices of calm along the way to stop myself from feeling overwhelmed and as of this week I’ve done a 15 min mediation every day and it’s magic. I do it while Skye naps and it’s incredible to see what a difference such a short practice can have. Helps that it’s on the DE app now and it’s with the phenomenal monk @gelongthubten - he was an incredibly special podcast guest for us last year, taking about how to cultivate happiness in a busy world, and were so happy that he’s bought to life our new wellness section for us. The 15 min body scan that I do is up now and we’ll be adding more each week ❤️❤️
user_22;user_22175.jpg;Future and current CEO of our family plant-based food company 🥰 Three and a half years after launching our food products we’ve managed to fill the office with plant-based deliciousness and it’s honestly such a proud moment for us all. We’re now in 7,000 stores around the UK and it’s just so beyond our wildest dreams. Getting to run this together is honestly the biggest joy either of us could have ever imagined and to be able to do it with a teeny in tow is even better. Hopefully Skye will one day be running it 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Matt says 2042 is her year 😋 Just a moment of such serious appreciation on a Wednesday. Thank you 🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️
user_22;user_22176.jpg;Pea and butter bean toast 🥰 Nice little swap from smashed avo, plus all the ingredients are kitchen staples so you don’t need to buy anything fresh except a squeeze of lemon - 1 tin of butter beans, 2 tablespoons tahini (needs to be a creamy, runny tahini and not a bitter one, I use Belazu), a big handful of frozen peas quickly boiled, a big squeeze of lemon, lots of sea salt, black pepper and olive oil 🥳
user_22;user_22177.jpg;The prettiest pea and cauliflower soup 🥰 Just what you need on a rainy January day 🌱 We’re a little non-stop with the app recipes this month, just wanting to make your new year health goals a little more delicious 😋

user_22;user_22185.jpg;Today’s a funny one, I so want to be positive and share some brownies and pasta but honestly I feel like this today 💔💔💔 The news is so scary, the fires are so scary, what’s happening in Iran and the Middle East is so scary and kale just doesn’t feel quite right today. We’ve just donated to the fire fighters in Australia but really I feel pretty powerless watching the world as it is right now. So this is just a little something for anyone else feeling the same way and most especially for any of Australian readers, we’re thinking of you and so hope you’re all ok. It’s a scary insight into what’s happening with the planet, but it also makes you think about the bigger picture too - yesterday I read that right now we’re killing about 200 million farm animals everyday around the world, something that doesn’t feel right either, it’s not just the fires that are hurting living beings, it’s the way we’re living. Who knows what we need to make the world a better, kinder, safer place for the next generation but today it feels like more love and Skye cuddles is the answer ❤️❤️❤️

user_22;user_22196.jpg;Merry Christmas everyone 🎅🏻 Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting our family, our company and our mission this year. We’re so grateful for everything this community represents and every single piece of encouragement and love you give us. 2019 has been a whirlwind and has given us the biggest blessing of our lives. Work has been busy though and our maternity/paternity time has been limited, so we’ve decided to take three weeks off over Christmas to switch off, recharge and most importantly enjoy our teeny Santa and her first Christmas. We’re off on an adventure tomorrow and cannot wait to soak up some much needed sunshine and quiet time as a new family. I’ll be offline and doing a little digital detox until the 1st, which I’m so excited about. Sending you all so much love, endless appreciation and cannot wait to see you in 2020 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ P.S any queries while we’re off social, email us - hello@user_22.com 🎅🏻
user_22;user_22197.jpg;"Cashew ceaser with brussels, hazelnuts, cranberries and chickpeas 🥰🌱 Serves 4  For the salad * 500g Brussel sprouts * 100g dried cranberries * 100g roasted hazelnuts * X1 400g can chickpeas For the dressing * 150g cashews * 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast * 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard * 1 tablespoon maple syrup * 10 tablespoons almond milk * Juice of 1 lemon * Salt Start by making the dressing; place the cashews into a blender with a couple tablespoons of the almond milk and pulse until a smooth paste forms. Once smooth, add the rest of dressing ingredients and pulse until a thick, smooth dressing forms. You can add a little more almond milk if you prefer a thinner consistency or your blender needs the additional liquid. Once you’ve made the dressing, leave it to one side and prepare the salad. Roughly chop the hazelnuts and drain the chickpeas. Wash and dry the Brussel Sprouts, before very finely slicing into thin strips - it should be the consistency of slaw. Place the sliced sprouts into a large bowl and add the dried cranberries, chopped hazelnuts and drained chickpeas, mix well. Finally, stir through the dressing before serving."
