user_21;user_212.jpg;Happy Fathers Day to all the wonderful dads of the world!! 🌈☀️❤️ Ill never forget the moment we found out we were pregnant with our first baby, we were in college, basically babies ourself, newly married at the doctors office, shem was barefoot and sandy eating french fries when the doctor came in and announced we were pregnant! His jaw dropped to the ground and tears started silently rolling down my cheeks. We were in shock! As soon as we walked out the door, Shem grabbed me, pulled me close and wrapped his arms around me and said, welp, looks like we are going to be a mom and dad and laughed! In that moment I went from being so scared to so excited and full of love and in that moment I fell more in love with this man than ever before. He accepted parenthood way before we thought we were ready with open arms and with all his heart and has been that day every since! He loves our kids so much, he helps them, he invests all time in them and enjoys them in every stage of life, diapers, sleepless nights and all! Its been such a joy to watch him go from single surfer boy to a father of three! Shem you should be so very proud of the man you have become! Full of love, forever giving and just the best friend to me and our kids we could ever possible ask for! 🥰❤️🥰❤️ #happyfathersday

user_21;user_2111.jpg;Hi, how are you? Im curious if you’d like to share anything new you have learned this week? Perhaps it will help us grow together! And if you have something you want to share I hope you feel safe to do it here. So a rule- Please be kind and constructive :)❤️. Firstly, a few days ago I asked about who you are, your background, ethnicity and perhaps befriend someone new in the comment space... and reading through your interactions with each other and learning all the things that make you you was so incredibly beautiful and special! You are amazing brilliant people!! Ill tell you what Im learning right now- love is complicated and expressed in may ways, even hate stems from hurt and that stems in love and sometimes when we feel attacked we take it personally when the reality is that person is hurting and needs our love. Ive also learned that I have a lot to learn. I have learned that its sometimes more important to listen and ask questions than it is to try and have answers. I have learned that is okay to own your faults and grow from them and how important it is take the time to understand people, who they are, where they are from, see them for who they are, that the differences we all have is beautiful and should be seen, should be celebrated and that when someone is feeling knocked down we need to all be there for each other to make things right. Im also learning how difficult it is to navigate difficult times but that doesn’t not mean shy away from it. I love you and I wish I could squeeze out any hate or pain or stresses anyone is feeling like Im hugging my sweet nalu here. I hope the world can heal and be better than we were yesterday! And I really hope that my words come across sincerely to you. Love you!
user_21;user_2112.jpg;Lets do something here- tell me where you are from, your race, something different and unique about you, THEN find someone else with a different background and respond with ❤️ and kind words, even if its a hi 👋🏼👋🏿👋🏻Maybe even follow them! This world needs unity, love and softened hearts. Lets spread some of that here. Perhaps encourage your online community to do the same! ❤️(I saw this on another page and it filled my heart). Sending love and so very excited to learn more about you. #lovematters #blacklivesmatter #endracism #onelove #friends #family

user_21;user_2119.jpg;"Be thankful for what you have and you will always end up with more. ✨ How about we put it to the test~Take a moment to name a few things your grateful for big or small. Share in the comments if you want to spread some of that positivity! Notice if it boosts your mood instantly and softens your heart. Lets see what happens if we hang on to that gratitude all day long! I guarantee it will change your entire day! It sure does for me. I dont know about you but I find its easy to start letting negativity creep in and sometimes it takes over but do you know what it never helps with annnnything and surely doesn’t get me to where I want to be or help improve my life. Positivity produces positivity. Negativity attracts more negativity. Its that simple. Im convinced gratitude is the secret sauce to quiet chaos and make dreams come true! 👏🏼✨🌈☀️Its worth putting to the test! ;) Grateful for you, grateful for my lil tribe, grateful for a new day, for peanut butter, grateful for humor, for growth, for this insanely beautiful planet, grateful for time, grateful for the breakfast I am about to make, the hugs Im about to give to my waking family, grateful to move my body, that I have a body I can move and grateful shem carries my long board for me 😋 haha.

We have been learning how to homeschool, taking each day at a time, drawing more, trying new home projects, trying out DIY’s, eating a lot of cookies haha, dabbling into home workouts and yoga, Im realizing that my coping methods are sweets and breaking a sweat every day haha, and just trying to stay uplifted. Crazy how this is starting to feel like the new normal eh? its crazy how we don’t know what the future is to hold... its a bizarre time, its stressful to think into it for me, so for now the most important thing has been to focus on the present keep peace in the home, keep the kids active and fulfilled, love one another and just try to find ways to support each other in this amazing community here! Its hard to know how everyone is handling this time so more than ever its important to be kind, support and uplift! Starting Monday with the goal to enjoy each day to the fullest even if that means staying in pjs all day :)

user_21;user_2140.jpg;LETS MOVE!! Its been a solid two weeks of motivating each other to move at home! How’d you like it?! Do you want another week?! LET ME KNOW! 🎉 @rocamoons and I have had so much fun sharing recommendations, doing challenges and being inspired by YOU! All while sharing some good laughs! Someone was asking me where I find the motivation to stay active and heres how- I personally have experienced the power of moving your body time and time again and I have learned consistency is your best friend. 💪🏼It becomes a feeling you crave. If your just getting into it, It sucks!But every day those feelings that hurt-tight lungs...jello legs... it will change to euphoric strength, I promise! 👊🏼 My mood, energy, digestion and confidence benefits which is why its a priority I try and get in almost every day. I have always had the goal to never not be able to do something because of my physical ability... I want to be that 80 year old surfing and hiking mountains😂👍🏽. And now that I have three boys my life is going to be a life of constant adventure and I am not planning to be on the sidelines.. I want to be doing everything with them. I have been pleasantly surprised how eating plant based vegan has helped me gain strength and agility and conditioning and clean eating really has complimented each other! What motivates you?! PS you want a good challenge, learn this routine! Throwback to being on a tiny island in the mentawais with my fire ball lil sister in law!
user_21;user_2141.jpg;Just trying to keep the romance alive quarantine style!😜👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨 Challenge someone to do this!Tag me & we will pick one winner to vemno $100 tomorrow!!👍🏽 😂. How are you guys doing, FOR REAL? Im feeling up and down to be honest, but at the same time almost guilty for even feeling stressed knowing our situation is not comparable to many others and then many times overwhelmed with gratitude. But hey, I just wanted to say, its a lot!! And we are all dealing with it in different ways, and thats okay! Theres no way to prepare for something like this other than learn to navigate as we go! Tell me whats been a highlight of this time and a low? A high for me-as scary as it, and we definitely don’t feel confident yet but I am excited to homeschool. We’ve always wanted to try and this has forced us into it so thats kinda cool and could be life changing, who knows! Its kinda hard with a baby and trying to work from home but figuring it out, i think... A low- well we live up stairs and have new neighbors beneath us and that definitely dont like how much we are home 😅 haha! anyway, sending love! If ya want to share please do! This is always a safe place! Love you!!🎉
user_21;user_2142.jpg;Sending love and wishes of good health and happiness from our family home to you!

K Tama- family, our home, living in hawaii and peanut butter (4 i know but whos really counting! , Ira- my family, Nalu’s cuteness, my cousins, Shem- “my beautiful amazing wife” 😂 “our three incredible awesome boys” and the place we live in all its gorgeousness” Me- my family, the ocean, shem’s giggle laugh and the fact that he makes it a point to hug and kiss me every single morning no matter what!

Name 3 ingredients in your kitchen you want to use and lets see what we can create out of them! 🥫🥑🥦🍍 Ill pick what seems the most common from your comments and try and make something (if i have it that is haha)! And if you have ideas for each other share in the comments for that person! Ingredients are definitely on the less exciting side in many of our kitchens due to everything going on so maybe we can inspire each other to make something cool with what we have on hand! Maybe its a can of beans, or tomato sauce or flour, or an orange... whatever, you name it, and we will create something more exciting from it!! PS if you want to make Jamu i have the recipe a few posts back! PPS Jamu means “herbal tonic” or “medicine” in Indonesian! Thanks for teaching me that @inkawilliams xoxo Stay happy & healthy friends!☀️

user_21;user_2146.jpg;Get in ma belly!! 🍇HOW TO MAKE A THICKSHAKE SMOOTHIE BOWL!! 1. Put frozen fruit in blender 2. Add a liquid 3. Blend until its a thick af smoothie bowl! 🤙🏽 Its that easy! But nailing the consistency is in a few lil details... SMOOTHIE BOWL BASICS 1. Use ripe spotted frozen bananas for your base 2. Dont use too many watery fruits. DO USE: Frozen mango, peaches, banana, and blueberries. Use more watery fruits like pineapple and strawberries as more of a flavoring agent but not as a consistency agent. 3. Plant milks help the creaminess but can still achieve a really good bowl without 4. Adding in a plant protein powder helps me feel my best! 5. A high powered blender will be one of your best life supporters! (I think there is going to be a big mothers day sale on this one I have if you want... i think!) If you have any questions let me know!! Btw, this is my first food tiktok!! How’d I do!?

user_21;user_2150.jpg;Find opportunity in uncertainty🤙🏽⚡️🦈 COMMENT ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️ if you moved yesterday OR going to today!!! Lets GO Day 3! So...It was announced that quarantine continues for the next 30 days...wow! What are you going to use this time for? Were you stuck doing a job you didnt like much and now you have the chance to look for something else? Have you put off learning an instrument for the past 10 years? Have you wished for more time with your family? Perhaps this is your opportunity to change your course, rewrite the next chapters, put some time into developing your talents, learn a new skill, start an online business, bake a new recipe, slow down, give praise for what we had like the freedom to go outside, travel, make choice, and community. Perhaps after this we will look each other in the eye and smile more, treat each other with more kindness, look for ways to support each other more, let go of any pride and be more connected and grounded than ever before. All I know is we are in this time together, we have the medical field fighting this battle every single day, we have our breath while others are fighting for theres. We all can rise above this and I think it starts with being grateful. Today I am extra grateful for my breath and your positivity and community. 🙏🏽💪🏼🤞🏽What are you grateful for? Sending love! #riseabove photo @ambermozo xoxox ps this is a throwback pic to swimming with the sharks in the deep blue sea, what an epic opportunity that was!🦈
user_21;user_2151.jpg;7 Day LETS MOVE AT HOME Challenge!! Comment below if you dare to accept this challenge to do together while we are all apart! Tag your buddies to challenge them in their home and lets do this thing!! @rocamoon and I are dedicating this week to supporting this challenge, sharing home exercises, resources and will share what you’re doing, what we are doing, and we can just have fun with it together!

Its also a proven automatic mood booster, and decreases feelings of depression, anxiety and stress no matter how hard or simple the movements are! 💪🏼 Lets come out of this wild time on top of it! Lets feel stronger, more resilient and better than ever! Lets DO THIS THANG!! PS I dare u to learn this routine 😂 you’ll be sweating at the end! Haha.

user_21;user_2155.jpg;JAMU WELLNESS SHOTS!! 🍋💦– an all natural healing anti-inflammatory immune boosting vibration raising Indonesian elixir originally made for royalty!👸🏽🌴wellness shots are so good for you but soo expensive but its actually super cheap and easy to make! With this recipe you can make a weeks worth of shots for the same price as one store bought! Jamu is made with fresh turmeric and ginger, a citrus and traditionally sweetened with honey but made today with maple syrup. Its soothing, healing, wakes you up instantly, and gives a major immunity boost! If you want to keep your self at peak condition or feel a cold coming on... this works like magic. I swear by it... You can drink this cold or like a tea! Stay healthy friends!! 🍋💦🍋💦🍋💦 PS I have no idea how Nalu can handle this! It definitely has a zingy kick! Haha! Can use less water to make it extra strong but this is the amount I love🤙🏽 🍋🍋RECIPE Jamu Shots * ½ cup fresh turmeric roots, rinsed, no need to peel * 3/4  cup fresh ginger roots, rinsed, no need to peel * 4 cups filtered water (or coconut water) * Maple syrup to taste 1-2 tablespoons (if using water) * Squeezed Lemon approx 2 tablespoons * 1/8 tsp black cracked pepper  Second way- my actual favorite but because groceries are scarce for many Im sharing the traditional way above. BUT putting in a medium sized pineapple and eliminated 1 of the cups of water from orginal recipe and keeping everything else the same is glorious!!!!! 🤙🏽 Making this in a blender! You can obviously do in a juicer if you have. Slice washed turmeric and ginger into thin disks place in a blender and add 4 cups water (you can use coconut water too! Blend for about 1 minute. Let stand a few minutes, strain into bowl if you want a smoother drink, (we just use a rice strainer but a french press works amazing if you have ) then pour into a quart jar and pour shots from there or heat up a mug like tea!! Store in the fridge with an airtight lid! Tag me if ya make it!!
user_21;user_2156.jpg;Good Morning! Today Hawaii goes into official quarantine for the next few weeks (atleast) and gosh how fast it makes you realize how much freedom we have on the normal day and how much I rely on nature to fill our days with peace and love and physical activity! Im going to be honest, I don’t really know how to be an indoor mom! I see some people doing all sorts of creative things inside and Im always so impressed cuz its kinda exhausting! If i was single this would be a vacay but with three kids with endless energy ... mmm... we got to think outside the box to stay inside our box! 🤪 So this week, Im going to make an extra effort to get create and make the most out of it and figure out some indoor games/ projects for this kids and baby. If you have ideas please do share!!! We are pretty set up (atleast enough peanut butter to last 😋). so Ill be sharing lots of simple recipes now and some home workouts etc oh and I downloaded tiktok it you want to follow (user_21)😂 Its so fun! Anyway! Loads of love for you! Stay present stay positive, let me know how you’re doing below, how you’ve been filling your days! Any good netflix series for shem and I to join??! We just finished curb your enthusiasm and the daily show, ah so good!💔🤩 We all in this togetha!!! #covid_19 #stayhome #love

You all are amazing! Where in the world are you right now? I hope you are near your loved ones! #family
user_21;user_2159.jpg;‘Social distancing’-gosh guys!! we are living in a time where for some of us its been hard to comprehend the extremity of whats happening globally. On the coast here you wouldn’t know that the world is shutting down unless you watched the news. What hit me hard is the realization that my actions could affect someone else. If not us, someones grandpa or parent or someone with a weakened immune system. It seems the only way to beat this is a global group effort to just mellow out, stay home, stay close to your loved ones but love everyone and everything else from a distance. Who would have thought one day showing love would be by keeping distance. How have these weeks affected you? Whats your thoughts? How are you feeling? Have you found ways that help you cope? My heart hurts for those affected directly or feeling worried.😭 I havnt been posting because I didn’t want to be insensitive to others during this time and didnt know what to make of it myself. We need to get home, strengthen our immune systems and reconnect then🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽i love you!
user_21;user_2160.jpg;PARTY WAVe!!🥳 We are taking party waves to AUSTrALIA today!! Wanna meet us there?! Hehe🌈💦 Have you been?!

All I know is I am so excited! I know it looks like life on here is just chillin beach and smoothies but its been such a crazy 18 months and so really looking forward to chilling out! Ill share all our on the go #plantoverprocessed and how we keep up with our health while traveling!! Eee! Have a beautiful day! Time to pack and jam! If you have questions about traveling on a plant based diet of with kids let me know and I can answer throughout the week xox
user_21;user_2161.jpg;"Anywhere with you is where I wanna be!!🤞🏽💦Pic 1,2, or 3?? I read this article about one the ‘blue zones’ (areas of the world with the highest longevity). It was getting into the top reasons these people lived such long and healthy lives and one of these zones (Okinawa- aka land of the immortals) top reasons is they believe in finding a life long purpose and another was a strong sense of friendship and community. They took care of each other. Isn’t that interesting! What do you think about that? How do you feel about these two areas? Perhaps our community on here can a blue zone one day! ;) I should also note that their diet was 67% Okinawan sweet potato’s!🍠 and ate predominately plant based with occasional small portions of meat on holidays. Today as part of #plantoverprocessed challenge lets take a long moment to think about how we can enrich our relationships, look for ways to lend a helping hand and give thought to what you feel your purpose of life is for you! Ill do the same! One of my main mission in life is to squeeze smiles out of my boys every second I can 😚 wishing you a beautiful day!"
user_21;user_2162.jpg;Just when you thought you were alone!🤪 Tag that friend😂  Lets call this recipe Purple Storm🌧🍇🍌🌪☔️💦💜’ 2 ripe frozen banana 1 cup blueberries Half zucchini (cant taste at all in a smoothie) avocado would be nice too Water Ice Spoon of Hemp hearts (no taste either just good natural occuring omegas and protein) Blended until smooth!! As Nalu demonstrated, its kid approved 😉 #plantoverprocessed Incase ya needed an extra smile today!
user_21;user_2163.jpg;GOOD MORNING MONDAY! ☀️☀️☀️ Lets focus on building our immune systems for week two of #plantoverprocessed!! Anyone else watching the news regarding the coronavirus? 😅 The best defense against any illness including the common cold and skin conditions in my opinion is having a strong immune system. What would you say is one way (share more if you like) to build your immune system? Here are my top 3 immunity strengthening tips I swear by~ Most important- 1. Eat more plants than processed. Whole plant based foods are crammed with vitamins, proteins, minerals, antioxidants and fibers designed to benefit us. Every bite benefits. Its as simple as swapping in oatmeal or fruit for breakfast instead of bagel and cream cheese. An apple instead of a bag of chips for a snack and making your salad dressing! Those small swaps end of making up your entire diet!! Before paying attention to our family diet we were basically eating empty calories in different forms- cereal, toast, bagels for breaky, sandwiches or pasta for lunch, crackers for snacks, bread, pizza or more pasta for dinner, cookies, or cake for dessert! No wonder we got sick all the time! Now, I cant remember the last time we got sick, knock on wood! 2. probiotic. If any of us have the start of a runny nose or start of a cough I make sure I get back on it with a probiotic, and focus on hydrating foods (smoothies, fruits, soups as the majority of their diet) 3. Positive relationship with food. If you do indulge, enjoy it I say!! Because food choices are the one thing we need to make decisions on every single day of our lives... make it a positive one! If we are stressing each time then that will add up! Things to help this postive relationship- take a moment to give thanks for your food! ~Google the benefits of foods your eating to help you learn and be mindful of it! (I use to do this allllll the time and now do it with the kids to help them gain a deeper appreciation for the simple things like a carrot stick haha. Anyway! I cant wait to hear what you do! Hope this is of any help to you! Stay healthy friends! ⚡️🥬🤙🏽
user_21;user_2164.jpg;I have some personal news I thought Id share on here... A few months ago I had my blood tested to find out my thyroid levels were completely normal for the first time!!! I’ve been dealing with hypothyroidism for years and told this would be a life long condition that I would need to monitor indefinitly. To my doctors surprise and mine too, my routine 6 month blood tests came back announcing my thyroid no longer needs any medication and is healthy🤯🥳 Its been such a freeing feeling and accomplishment I never thought possible and have a plant based diet to thank! By no means is my diet perfect but I have been consistent over the past 4 + years consuming more plants than processed and striving for a positive relationship with food! When I first went plant based 4+ years ago I had a laundry list of health conditions that made it difficult to function like a normal person, every day was uncomfortable and I was often told by doctors that what I had would lead to even more serious conditions as I aged. Well I am here to tell you, YOU can change your story! You are more in control of you than you might realize! If you invest in that belief who knows what your tomorrow will bring! Thank you for letting me share...every year I feel stronger, something I never imagined possible just a few years ago! This is why I am so in love with sharing and supporting and being apart of this rad positive lil community! i know what a difference figuring out you for you can... WILL be! I love ya! And here for ya!! Thank you for being here for me! 🤞🏽💕😊 📸 @ambermozo xoxoxo #plantoverprocessed for liiiife 🥬>🍕 #grateful

user_21;user_2178.jpg;Banana Prepping with my lil coconut!🌼🐒🍌🤙🏽 Prepping bananas is an example of a small step that pays off in big ways! Having healthy ingredients on hand can make all the difference! ⚡️🌼Another small step that can deliver big results is incorporating a daily multivitamin like @ritual to help fill in the nutritional gaps in your diet. 🍋I like @ritual because it has 9 essential nutrients like methylated folate and b-12! Plus, Ritual is non-GMO, vegan-certified, with no fillers or shady additives. They are super transparent with their ingredients and their Essential for Women multivitamin is now clinical-backed! It really is the small things that add up to make all the difference!

user_21;user_2180.jpg;Q: HOW DO I KEEP MY PRODUCE FRESH LONGER?!🥬💦 How sad is a limp carrot, or wilted unused leafy greens?🥬🥦🥕🌶🍆🍅Lets make sure that doesnt happen. Here is some life hacks that will save you money and keep your health goals on point in the freshest way possible! A: FIRST- DO NOT store in airtight PLASTIC! Why? plastic bags and containers keep too much moisture in and sealed plastic does not allow vegetables to breathe which creates an environment where ⚗️ethylene gas ⚗️concentrates and thats what promotes rotting! 🦠🤯 So, INSTEAD: Use cotton fabric to wrap your vegs🤲🏼You can DIY out of old pillow cases (my friend inspired this idea for me) or use old baby swaddles (what im currently using), the best fabrics are muslin or french terry which helps keep produce alive, crisp and fresh for a week longer! (you can find online produce bags too). 🥬 TO properly use for leafy greens (no need to wet for other produce)~ wash your greens, drip off any excess water, and roll inside the fabric while damp. The fabric will absorb the water and contain moisture (similar to how can wrap veggies in wet paper towels). This protects refrigerated greens from dehydration and wilting and will keep them fresher for so much longer and in a very eco friendly way!💚.If they get dry just spray some water inside! 🥬One more tip- store soft herbs (except basil) and even kale in mason jars with water like you would a bouquet of flowers. (Kale is good wrapped too) I promise you this will change your produce life! Okay one more- IF your leafy greens or herbs are a little wilted- bring them instantly back to life by emerging in a bowl of ice water for a minute! Its like magic!!! 🍠🥑🥦🥬Okay promise last one- eat #plantbeforeprocessed ! Eat the plants before diving into your forever shelf life groceries to ensure you consume all your hard earned beautiful body loving nutritious living loving plants! Hope this helps improve your produce game!!!

In that case roast it once for 25-30 min and add hot sauce after for best texture! PS are we sick of this song yet? 😂🤙🏽 Buffalo Cauliflower Bites Recipe  Ingredients *medium sized head cauliflower * ¾ cup garbanzo flour- * You can use all-purpose flour or gf flour * 1 teaspoon paprika * 2 teaspoons garlic powder * 1 tsp onion powder * 1 teaspoon salt * ½ teaspoon pepper * ¾ cup unsweetened plant milk * 1 head cauliflower * ¼ cup buffalo sauce or hot sauce * 2 tablespoons olive oil * 1 tablespoon maple syrup  Preparation * Preheat the oven to 450˚F Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. * In a large bowl, mix together flour, seasonings and plant milk. * Break the head of cauliflower i to about 1½-inches pieces.

user_21;user_2186.jpg;"Live with LOVE!! Did you know our stomach is considered our “second brain” and its health is related to our state of happiness? I read something super interesting yesterday I want to share with you! Im paraphrasing here...75% of the body’s neurotransmitters are produced in the gastrointestinal tract that directly communicate with the brain. Because of this, the health of your gut and fact there are trillions of bacteria that live there is tightly linked to your brain function and mental health. Research suggests gut bacteria is so powerful it can cause depression and anxiety and can be used to treat clinical depression and emotional instability! Therefor a healthy gut = happy mind= better life! ;)’ This is one example of how important it is to take care of the guts enviroment - I use to wake up feeling blah and kinda down, and took effort to feel positive, now i wake up feeling good, light hearted and stable effortlessly. The only thing that changed in my life was my health so Ive experienced this first hand! If this relates to you, perhaps focusing on fixing your gut is the answer! Just thought Id share as I found it very interesting and if you want to read more see @naturalhealinghawaii link! Lots of love!!"
user_21;user_2187.jpg;"Pic 1,2,3 or 4?!😜🥬 OK A look at PLANT HAUL week 2 and 5 WAYS TO REDUCE BLOATING and maintain a happy flat tummy and get the best digestion possible as requested!! Especially if your a sensitive one like I was- these are game changers!👌🏽💦 1. FOOD COMBINING- eat in the order of how fast the foods digest. SO melons on empty stomach, then fruit, then vegetables (although leafy greens can be eaten with everything), then legumes and grains and if you eat animal products- then dairy then meat (takes 18+ hours to digest where fruit takes 30 min). Even if you have a plate full of different food groups it can even help to eat around your plate in this order! This was life changing and easy once u get the hang of it. 2. DRINK SLOWLY- best to be chill and enjoy your smoothies and water so it too can have a chance to be digested properly too. 3. COOK CRUCIFEROUS VEGS- broccoli, cauliflower, brussle sprouts, cabbage. These veggies have the same sugars that beans have that make them gassy but cooking them helps alot. Even massaging cabbage with lemon helps. 4. Stay away from processed foods ;) including misleadingly healthy ones labeled vegan, gluten free etc. Once you’re digestion is on point then try adding in things and see how you feel. 5. CHEW YOUR FOOD WELL- chewing is the first step to digestion so doing a good job at it will help alot! 6. LIMIT FAT- Eat as much fruits and veggies as your heart desires keeping that the majority of your diet instead of filling up on nuts, seeds, cooking with lots of oil, and consuming fried foods. 7. LIMIT SALT- You will likely notice a difference in two days if you cut out salty foods not only in your belly but your face and body- you’ll see the difference in the mirror. 8. Consider taking a pre-pro biotic (natural foods to get this is sauerkraut, kimchi, kombocha, miso) I try to take this supplement regularly to be consistent. Wowa that was a lot of info! These will most definitely help anyone going plant based or not! Let me know if you have questions! #plantoverprocessed yew! 🥬⚡️🥬⚡️🥬⚡️🥬⚡️"

user_21;user_2191.jpg;Plant over proccessed was the very first rule i made for myself and ultimately changed my health forever over 4 years ago. At first it felt like a punishing act to reach for something like an apple when all I wanted was a chocolate bar and bag of chips. But the craziest thing started to happen- every time I ate ‘plant’ the desire for processed diminished! It calmed my aggressive cravings and I could then make better diet choices and before I knew it I was eating more plant foods than I had in my entire life! I told myslef, if you want the processed after go for it BUT eat something plant BEFORE you do. So that is where this rule of thumb was born- ultimately I was training my hand to reach for something healthy instead of cave into cravings when hunger hits and most likely to hit the salts and sweets! Long story short it changed my life and I found freedom from my health issues and what started off feeling restrictive created more freedom and appreciation than I could imagine! I thought id share part of my story with you and why im so excited and passionate sharing and supporting it with you and SO very excited with you! Woohoo!! 🍇😉✌🏼#plantoverprocessed

user_21;user_2193.jpg;Fresh Feelings For 2020!!💧#plantoverprocessed challenge starts tomorrow!! Begin today by writing down in the comments below your WHY! Why are you motivated to eat more plants? To make change... writing it down somewhere will help solidly it. Looking back 2019 I would say it was a year of grounding. I told myself at the beginning of the year my goal was to ‘protect my peace’ by focusing all my energy on whats most important to me- my family, and soaking in all the love and slobbery kisses of our new baby- and saying no to everything that competed. This mind shift made everything go from feeling like I was missing out on things to LOVING the peace and memories its brought! I gave up opportunities to grow in work, make more money, and instead if travellings a bunch we found adventure in our own neighborhood, in our kitchen, hanging out laughing on the living room floor, figuring out real passions and just being... and its been one of the best years of our life! Its been a year focusing on our new baby, slowing down in ways and filling our hearts with the love and memories that come for this! Im so grateful for this past year! It was a beautiful beautiful year. Im so lucky to have my family. It doesn’t matter if we are jumping around the globe or cuddled in bed, its them that makes it magical! But in saying that, I get the feeling that 2020 is going to be an adventurous one! Haha Whatever 2020 is for you, let it bring you peace and love and happiness!! What are your feelings?!
user_21;user_2194.jpg;Affirmations✨’positive reminders or statements that can be used to encourage and motivate yourself and others’. You see them everywhere, on T-shirts- all over social media, on the side of buildings on coffee mugs, and for what? - Because its cute? Well, if you look into the power of affirmations its proven to improve your mindset on a daily basis, and research has shown that they can actually increase your feelings of self-worth. Our thoughts play the biggest part in our overall success and happiness and left alone can fall into negative patterns which hold us back to living our best lives. Maybe 2020 isnt so much about specific goal setting as it is taking care of our mind, being kind through our thoughts,fine tuning our daily mind set, and seeking to uplift ourselves and others. Perhaps everything from there will naturally find its course...I dunno but Im pretty sure the stronger these roots are the better all will be! Wishing good vibes and love for you going into the New Year! Its gunna be a good one! ✨⚡️✨⚡️✨⚡️✨

And in case you’re wanting to chill and make some warm moist scrumptious muffins here is the recipe from last post!! 👨🏽‍🍳👩🏽‍🍳🍪This one is worth saving!! Healthy Chocolate GF V Muffins! INGREDIENTS Dry Ingredients * 1 1/2 cups organic all purpose baking flour- we use GF * 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder * 1 teaspoon baking soda * pinch of teaspoon salt Wet Ingredients * 1 1/4 cup plant milk (oat milk is our fav) * 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil or grape seed oil * 1/2 cup maple syrup * 1 cup mashed ripe banana * 1 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Add-in Ingredients * 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease 12 cup muffin tin with a bit of coconut oil and dust with a bit of flour to prevent sticking 2. In a large bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. 3. In another bowl mix together Plant milk, mashed banana, melted coconut or grape seed oil, coconut sugar, and vanilla. Whisk until well incorporated. 4. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Whisk until just incorporated, making sure no flour patches remain. Fold in chocolate chips. 5. Pour batter evenly, about 3/4 of the way for a greater quantity of smaller muffins, or all the way to the top for a big muffins. Bake for 16-22 minutes (on the higher end for larger muffins). Insert a toothpick to test for doneness—it should come out mostly dry! 6. Cool and ENJOY the chocolate of your labor!

I felt defeated every day and quite lost in more ways than one. It was when I told myself, wait you’re in charge of you here, take control of your life and figure this all out! Thats when everything shifted and i realized no one can help you as much as you can! Opening this page to journal and to be influenced and learn and get inspired by you guys fully helped me do that and find my path and very quickly life changed! Drastically! I have health on my side which changes every facet of life and i wish that upon everyone! I hope that this journal of mine can be a support to anyone, even if its just one person like you have been for me! Love you guys!! And cant wait to read through and answer a bunch of your Q’s!!!!

user_21;user_21106.jpg;ACAI PiNEAPPLE kinda mornings!! Happy Monday🍍🍇💦 Whats the easiest way to get loads of fruits and veggies into your kids? And yourself for that matter. Make it taste good👊🏼Healthy should be delicious no questions asked in my opnion🥑🥖! And sometimes to get the most out of your planty vibe choices it takes a few moments to adjust your taste buds but it wont be long I PROMISE you before you start raving about a new green juice combo you’ve discovered or a juicey apple you’ve bit into! So a tip! Start gradually. If you start slow then they wont put any guards up (100x easier this way!) For green smoothies I use to put in just a little, like a handful, and the rest fruit (pineapple banana with a little oat milk and ice with kale or spinach is ammmmazing! (Add a little mint and its bonkers!). I would even hide the color by putting it on a jar with a lid so they couldnt make any pre-judgments. Then i started uping the greens and before you know they are asking for the green one (myself included)! Which we call gummy bear by the way, 😋💚 Im a sucker for names as much as kids are!) Do you give your foods names? Tell me in the comments! Another one~ Spagetti squash is monster hair in our home! I also make up elaborate stories about how these ingredients make muscle pop into the arms over like Thor or your eyes can see three times as far after a bowl of peas! Or how eating broccoli will give you super powers to get barrelled 🌊 And as they get older they can learn more details about what vitamins really do in the body and the fascination continues!. The more they (myself included) learn the more exciting healthful choices are! The more meaningful it becomes! I love knowing Im nourishing my body and how every healthful effort supports that with simultaneously supports and extra exciting life and seeing the same results pay off in my kids life is so rewarding! Have you experienced this or wish to? If you have questions feel free to ask!

user_21;user_21110.jpg;In case ur looking for a DIY gluten free dairy free vegan cake idea~ try WaTERmELON CAKE!! 😂🍉Ira wanted to make a watermelon cake for Nalus bday and when we googled it, there was so many pretty options (swipe to see a few!) ours didnt turn out as fancy but it was SO fun to make! If your interested in making~ you just cut the rind off of a large watermelon, cut into circles, stick it with skewers to hold and decorate it with whatever! Cookie cutters work good to make different fun shapes. It was as fun to make as it was to eat! You can get fancy and put coconut whipped cream in it, 🥥🤤 but I just drenched it in extra pineapple juice from the left over pineapple for extra sweetness and flavor! 🍍And the rest you can serve in a bowl or make into watermelon juice! Definitely recommend making one for any occasion! Haha pic @cravegreens xo
user_21;user_21111.jpg;HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY Nalu Lux!!!🥳🍍🐒 Wow! A year to this day our bright eyed bushy tailed soul came into this world! I spent most of the day laboring in the stillest of ocean water while Tama, Ira, and Shem played around me. I knew this could very well be our last time as a family of four. I soaked in those hours as much as I possible could! Later that afternoon we knew it was time to pack our bags. After a night of laboring, i asked my mid wife, how long do you think ill labor like this, its now 2 am, and she says, “ask the 8 ball” 😂 not the answer I was hoping for but knew it was the best she could do! I asked the 8 ball, “will i give birth at 6 am and it showed a capital lettered ‘YES’! That hope was good enough! And you know what, at 6 am to the dot he came out and had his first breathe of air! The nurses had a good laugh as they wrote that on his birth certificate. The morning he came was came in was the biggest ocean swell of the year and so we named him Nalu Lux which means wave of light 🌊✨ and thats exactly what he’s been for our family! So much love bursts out of this guy’ not a day goes by I don’t thank the skies he chose us to be his family! Nalu Lux keep making waves! 🌊⚡️🌊You’ve got an exciting life a head of you!! PS thank you for loving him so much! Its the most beautiful thing to feel and see! Love makes more love and that is beyond beautiful!!
user_21;user_21112.jpg;😄🥒🥬 The Q: ‘How do you get your kids to eat a variety of healthy foods and how is it your kids are so happy?’ I did a Q&A the other day in my stories and these were popular questions so here is my A: The two are largely related. We have found a strong correlation between our children’s diet and their behavior. This is partially due from WHAT they eat, but also HOW (how is a whole new convo). If they are jacked up on fast sugars its hyper to moody, being overly sensitive and soon to have an attitude-not that fun to be around. 🥴Happens hardly every tho. But if they are nourished they are happy, energetic, positive and just rad mini humans!Its so easy to see which is why its extra motivating to be consistent! It makes life more enjoyable when everyone is feeling their best! It makes parenting a lot more enjoyable too! But if they are jacked up on sugar its like, get these kids ouuuttta here!😂 the same is for adults, well definitely for me! My whole being feels better when taking care of my nutrition, have you experienced this? So how do you get kids to start? I could talk a lot on this but this post is getting long so heres my biggest tip for now....whatever it is that keeps showing up on their plate is what they will end up eating! Whatever is “normal” in your house will become the base of your diet. And if normal does not include fruits and vegetables then its going to take time BUT it will change! Tama was a i only eat noodles and cereal child. (I was a young mom that thought, oh this is what kids eat)so he took some “training”. The rule was “you dont have to like it but you have to try it!” He might touch his tongue and that be it. Next time a tiny nibble. After 7 days of refusing it but it still showing up to his place... he eats it!!! And likes it!! Now there is a new healthy food hes familiar with! Then introduce a new veggie! It works! I changed his entire eating in a matter of months! With my youngest i started with veggies and fruits straight away so all he eats are plants! Simply because this is his normal! It can be a bit of a patience game if you’re retraining but the benefits are life changing!
user_21;user_21113.jpg;Vegan Chili on da Beach!! Comment below your ALL TIME favorite home cooked meal growing up! Shem and his 6 brothers grew up on a lot of big pots of hot chili and rice! It was the ultimate come home from a long beach day of surf to a hot warm pot of chili! I loved seeing these big pot meals his mom and dad would make to feed her tribe and his parents always always to this day make extra just in case any friends or family stop on by~ which is always! Haha! This style of cooking is something ive adapted and im stoked to be able to keep some of our childhood favorites by just swapping ingredients to make super yummy vegan versions that meet our family’s lifestyle! Im so curious what your fav was is!! And why! I want to make some of them!! Food is love isnt it!
user_21;user_21114.jpg;Flowers in my hair, sandy toes, acai bowls, salty skin, sounds of waves, sea breeze, warm sun, sounds of laughter, playful banter, feeling love, giving love, appreciating, living free, this is what life is meant to be, I pray forever, for me. Take a moment and describe and just manifest what it is exactly you want in your life because that is where the magic starts to spark! Even if you dont write it here, allow yourself to take a moment to close your eyes and check in, with you. ‘Are you living in a way that helps you get to where you want to go?’ That is the question I check in with myself and im pretty sure aligning life in that manor is the simple secret to making the most elaborate of all dreams come true! Maybe it takes a lot of work to do it but if you love what you do and find purpose, youll never work a day in your life! 🌺✌🏽PS can we all just start wearing flowers every day! @ocean_dreamerr, ur magic🌺🌸🌺🌸

user_21;user_21116.jpg;Today is a good day to have a good day!!☀️✌🏽 Happy TUeSDAY! So, every night we say a ‘family prayer’ together and each night is someones turn to do it. Its a chance to reflect on the day, listen to whats going on in our littles hearts and minds and share gratitude. Last night Ira said something that really struck a chord for me and as a result I am going to dedicate my week with this as my mantra and i totally invite ya to do the same! ~ Ira prayed~ ‘thank you that tomorrow will be a good day!’ ☀️He had already decided that tomorrow was going to be good! It didn’t matter what was happening or will happen, its going to be good! I LOVE that! It really does come down to deciding how we interpret our moments, and as a whole our life. So this week, no matter what happens what if we make it the goal to have the good outweigh any stress, any bad and chalk up every single day as good! lets see what happens! What do you have planned this week?! Im making and shooting a massive amount of recipes this week!! Its going to be busy and instead of letting stress run the show excitement and gratitude is going to lead the way! I absolutely love how powerful little children’s perspectives can be! Flipping the world for us right side up!! ✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽anyway, lots of love and wishing you a whole lotta good! Always! Ps if youve never had starfruit lemonade~ def make it if you have the chance ⭐️💦
user_21;user_21117.jpg;"Families are FOREvA! 🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒✨ Im curious! How long have you been following along my page?!? Aka a part of our family! 🤗 Let me know in the comments!! If you’re new to my page here is some fun facts about me! (please share some of you so I can get to know you more too!) Okay... 1. I started this page when i was desperate for a health change. I used it to journal and learn and it changed my life (this is where my passion for natural health was born). Still blows my mind the difference its made to me. I wish happy health for everyone. 2. I am 1 of 7 siblings. So is Shem (my husband!) 3. We both thought we’d get married later in life after we explored the world and experienced “life”, 4. We got married at 19. 5. After 1 week after locking eyes we were engaged! 6. We thought we would wait to have kids. 7. 1 year later we had a surprise pregnancy- Tama! We were both in college. (The calendar method does not work haha). 8. Starting a family has been our most beautiful blessing! That and finding each other. 9. Im pretty sure my language love is food, and touch and gifts- okay all of them! 10. I grew up thinking I was going to be the first woman in the NBA. Basketball was my family’s passion! Surfing was Shems! Now surfing is our lil family of three monkeys passion with a good game of bump in the backyard ;) 11. Since I was a little kid and to this day I drink hot chocolate with cereal on top almost daily. Haha I have a bit of an addictive personality 12. Hawaii is home! 13. Im currently been working my butt of pouring my heart into a secret passion project i cant wait to share with u! 14. Im pretty sure when people see me they see a big acai bowl! 😂 therefore our house is alway always stocked to make you one! 😜 Okay Im done! Your turn!! PS like our new swing?! 🤩 Shem made sure it was extra securely put up this time 😂 @roseavenuehome we are in love with it, thank u friend!"
user_21;user_21118.jpg;These are the days to remember!✌🏽☀️ You know whats interesting about that statement~ it applies to any day you are ‘currently’ living! Right here right now. Sponge it alllll up! 🧽The good and the bad is shaping us into who we are and making our life what it is. embrace it! And if you don’t like what your embracing change it👊🏼 What I have found works SO well to find a balance and helps me embrace whats most important to me is figuring out what IS most important to me and then warding off everything else that competes with it as much as I can. Sometimes saying NO to even good things is what it takes to protect what is most precious. Its okay to say no, and its okay to slow down and its okay to work hard for what you want! Life is happening, decide to be there for it! I need this reminder for myself! I use to have a hard time being present. I was always wondering what the next big thing happening would feel like. For example, the first time I was pregnant I was sooo excited to get pregnant and then when i was i was already thinking of what it would be like to have a baby! I realized later I was missing out on what i was currently experiencing! It took practice to focus on the now instead of getting too ahead of myself. Its made the world of difference and something to check in with from time to time and has made life 1 billion times more fulfilling. Anyway! Love ya! Hope ur living ur best life to zee fullest!

user_21;user_21120.jpg;Groms raising Groms with sum Cucumber LoVIN!!🐒🥒 Ira made Nalu a fancy lunch of spiraled cucumbers today and entertained him the whole time too! swipe for some giggles😂) ~ I remember my mom telling me that when she had her 5th kid she started to wonder how she was going to do it all (I come from a family of 7 siblings!) and she said she had the thought, if I them each something they could be responsible for every day (besides our own normal chores) that would help lift the load! ~ Someone would be in charge of making oatmeal every morning, another she taught how to grind the wheat and make the bread (we had the scariest sounding grain mill in our basement☠️) another how to set the table and clean up, and another to do the laundry, shovel the driveway and pay the taxes 😛 jk. but so on! It was then that life got more manageable and the kids are learning new life skills along the way feeling good about it! I am taking on that same advice more than ever now that my kids are a little older to take on bigger responsibilities! Like get this... Shem and I now can lay on the floor and talk and watch our kids clean up dinner, sweep the floor, wash the dishes, take out the garbage (the most exciting part cuz theirs a lot of wild boars around these day 🐗) and put everything away from start to finish!! You know how amazing that feels! 🥳Feels like we graduated some stage of life! Haha. Anyways it sure is rewarding to do life together! Sometimes it creates a lot more mess and time in the early years but the more they are accustomed to helping and loving being around the easier and more helpful they will be in the long run! Im really hoping this snowballs in all sorts of ways! Haha. How about you? How do you feel about your kids helping out? Or what do you remember having to do in your family growing up?
user_21;user_21121.jpg;"You know its right when the spoon sticks like dis!!🥄🍇👌🏽 The Question: HOW do you get THICK SHAKE nice cream TEXTURE?? 🥥🍌Heres the secrets! 😉.... Number 1~ you need frozen fruit or frozen plant milk cubes (DIY with an ice tray with coocnut, almond,soy or oat milk 🥥🍌2. The base (at least 1/4 of the ingredients used should be creamy banana or avo, or use frozen plant milk cubes. (Or both ;) 🚀3. A high powered blender is a life changer!!! Been using ours for 15 years. I love vitamix. Costco sells them for a super good price or can find used online if you want to save 💸). 🥛4. Use as little liquid as possible. I use about 1/3-1/2 cup of plant milk for two servings. 🔮5. This is where people tend to go wrong~ you gotta Blend and Mash, Blend and Mash! You have to stop and mix a few times because you’ll get air bubbles when its thick. It will take probably 2 min total until you get this thick swirl! 🧿6. I blend on low for a few seconds then medium for a few seconds while the frozen fruit bounces around and gets broken up, then on medium high while you blend and mash a few times! You might have to stop the machine a few times! 🦠And a tip and money saver is using a plant protein powder with water works great for a creamy liquid or even freezing into cubes! (I mostly use a good plant protein powder over plant milk because its easy and cheaper, and i like how my body digests it, and the flavor. Do you want a little video showing the steps!? Maybe thats easier! Haha. All i know is texture is a game changer so heres how to get it right! 💪🏽If you have questions let me know! 🔮😘"

user_21;user_21124.jpg;Beach Quenchhhh💦💦~Nalus face reps the phases of drinking lemon water for the first time~ phase 1: okay I’m down, phase 2. oh this nasty~ phase 3: okay okay I can get use to this! Haha! Back in my IBS chronic stomach pain bloat 24/7 fatigue days I use to think, “am I not doing enough by trying to eating descent?” it wasn’t enough. I needed a bit of a formula to live by and beat this storm of a stomach that was always so uncomfortable. Four years ago I finally figured out what works and pretty sure would benefit anyone with sensitive digestion ~ 1 drink filtered water between meals including starting your day this way. 2. ⚡️FOOD COMBINING✨! You can eat all the “right foods” but eating in the ‘wrong’ order and your stomach can flare quite easily. I was skeptical at first but I live by loose food combining rules now and its freeedom!! Its given me freedom to enjoy things like going to the beach with my kids without feeling like curling up in a ball and just wishing the day would end which is why Im so passionate about sharing. So here is the basis if you wanna try! 1. Melons digest in 5 min aprox so only consume on an empty stomach (morning time) to avoid stomach gas 2. fruits only before any cooked foods or wait hours (they are the second fastest digesting foods) If I eat cooked im usually not going to eat any more fruit that day. 3. Leafy greens go with everything good. 4. If you eat meat then these rules would be amplified as meat can take 18+ hours to digest and allllot of energy to break it down. So basically you want to eat foods in order of how fast they digest. Melons-fruits-greens-starches-grains for me and then dairy and meats are the hardest digestion which is why i found sooo much success eliminating completely. ✨Sensitive stomach= eat sensitive foods for a super digestive tract! ✨👌🏽 Tip - even if u eat ur plate of food and work your away around it in this order it will help! If you have questions or comments let chat in the comments!!
user_21;user_21125.jpg;Let your dreams be your wings!! Watching my son it makes me think~ If you tell yourself ‘I cant, I wont. If you tell your self I can, I can I can even if I currently cant, I eventually will! Im 100% sure if you can believe in that- you can do anything! 💪🏽✨🌙💪🏽Tama wrote down a goal on his wall at the beginning of this year, to “land an ‘AIR REVERSE’”. At the time i was thinking in my mind, ‘oh gosh’. And was nervous he might end up dissapointed if he doesnt do it as its a hard goal to pull off and his surfing at the time was no where near ready BUT in his mind he was visualizing the end goal! all he was thinking was “ Im going to land an air reverse this year!!’ and was giddy about it! And you know what happened He did it! He practiced and practiced, and as a result his surfing improved little by little every day and he made his dream goal come true!! Tama ur are a little examplar of following ur heart bubba!! I needed this reminder myself. Negative self talk gets your know where, positive self talk can take you anywhere! ✨⚡️Whatever ur dream is big or small, go for it! Just keep telling yourself you can and eventually you will! Whats a dream you have?! Big or small! PS ~ this is tamas first edit. Hehe- we gave him our old computer for his bday cuz he wants to learn how to edit video! He wanted to show the progression to the end goal! He did so good ya! So cuuute❤️ #proudofyou

user_21;user_21128.jpg;Lunch Time! 🥑🐾 Q: What does my vegan baby eat? And how did I introduce foods? And a few tips! Lets Chat! A: I started introducing solids between 6-7 months as ive continued to breastfeed . I started with one food at a time and waited 3ish days before introducing the next food (To see if his digestion or skin was trigged). For the first two months I kept foods without seasonings so he could appreciate the taste of the plant. After I started adding a bit of cinnamon/ cumin/ and diferent spices to get an appreciate for new flavors. I first introduced Nalu to vegetables, then fruits, then grains. (My other twos only would eat grains forevver so reversed it and it worked!) I didnt follow a method but I did read all your advice and took from there my own ‘plan’ so thank you!! Nalu has had such a successful journey thus far with foods! He loves such an array of foods which makes me soooo happy! Its been fun! I have been strict for him not to have any sugars as I know a plain potato cant compete with a cookie haha so it can wait! Haha. Ill list the foods he started off with! (I never ended up blending anything or buying any baby food, i just brought an avocado and a spoon around, or a baked potato wrapped in foil, or a cucumber, peach, mango etc and feed him by squishing it with my hands as he ate. This was soo much easier and took a lot less time then making ‘baby food’ . He eats portions of what i eat instead. So heres a list of foods he started with-avocado, zuchinni, potato, sweet potato, squash, cucumber, peas, poi, edamme, chickpea, soft fruit like papaya, mango, cherries, peaches, figs, tomatoes, steamed carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, cherries, then blended smoothies, then oatmeal! Now hes eating soups, salsa, sauerkraut etc but it was so beneficial to go slow! As a result he hasnt had any any constipation, no diaper rashes, no belly aches and just been a happy lil thing growing like a weed! its been an incredible little journey thus far!! (Getting my others to like a variety of veggies and fruits took years!! (Cuz i started on grains and “baby food”! Anyway! For those asking!! Please share your experience! Or if you have have questions feel free to ask!

user_21;user_21131.jpg;"Homemade 3 INGREDIENT vegan SalteD CAraMEL!! ✨This is the best caramel we’ve ever made!! You can use it for everything like these gf twix bars, do a caramel fruit fondue, drizzle on nice creams and everything or spoon it! 😛 You’re going to want to save this recipe!! RECIPE 2 cups full fat coconut cream (here i used organic canned coconut milk) but full on coconut cream is better🤤 2 cups coconut sugar Pinch of sea salt Caramel Method: Mix everything  and consistently stir as it boils on medium heat until. It will take about 35-45 minute to cook down (put on some music, listen to a pod cast ;). You can test the consistency along the way by putting some drops into a cup of ice cold water. Once you can form a soft little ball with the caramel between your fingers you know your done! Once you’ve done it once your know what to look for it will become easy and you’ll be a pro at making caramel for liiife!! You can add a tbsp of coconut oil for added body and flavor if you dont have rich coconut cream! Sometimes i add vanilla too at the end. Keeps in the fridge in an air tight container! (Note dont dip the spoon lick it and put it back in or get it wet. Try not to have anything disrupt your heavenly pot of caramel gooo until its done! ✨✨✨) Have you ever made caramel before?! (Learned how to make caramel from my mom but this simple recipe i learned from @nowonlume except he used a different sugar (so you can interchange if you want) in the mentawAis last summer!🌴) oh and if you put it in the freezer it will be more like a caramel chew✨👌🏽 the last frame i didnt even let it cool hhaa i was too excited 😛"

user_21;user_21141.jpg;HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our TAMA Ole Vasa!💙🌊💙Tama’s name means ‘boy of the sea’ and that’s exactly who he’s always been!💙🌊You’re more likely to find him in the water than on land. His passion for the ocean runs deep in his veins. 💫We had Tama when we were both in college, working odd jobs, surfing every spare second, a few dollars to our name and just figuring out life! He’s the biggest blessing to our family! His heart is pure, he’s kind, he loves and cares about people, his friends, his family, the land, the animals, and he’s just a lil passionate white haired little stallion!! I can hardly believe he’s turning 11 today! That must mean I’m not 19 anything eh? 😂😭 Swipe to see last big as a baby! 😭💙 anyway, if ya see him today, give him a big hi five!!!🖐🏽🖐🏽🖐🏽🖐🏽
user_21;user_21142.jpg;Umm Hi MR!!🍇who wants to break it to Nalu bear it’s suppose to go IN da mouf 🤪 🖐🏽introducing foods has been soooo fun!! And so successful this time around! With my other kids it was recommended grains and ‘baby food’ which resulted in my first two spitting out everything else out for a long long time. but with Nalu I did it much different! And so far he loves a whole smorgesboge range of healthy foods right from the start. Nalus favorite foods to date are- avocados, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, peas, zunchinni, cucumbers, Acai bowls, sauerkraut, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, mango, papaya and salad mashed up in avocado. I started with just plain natural flavors and with foods one by one and then after a few months started adding spices like cinnamon and cumin. If you’re interested in a break down of what’s I’ve found to be successful let me know and I’ll totally go into detail! It’s my current passion right now! 😂🤓😛🍇

user_21;user_21148.jpg;Oh la la! Vegan Rasberry Sorbet! The first time I ever made a “healthy dairy free DIY ice cream was with Shem’s lil bro Shezy ( @hannemann7 😛) 10 years ago in his parents kitchen! We took a cup of dairy free coffee creamer and blended it up with a few cups of frozen mango and it was sooo good! We were pumped and pat ourselves on the back for being so healthy! Haha! We even got “sugar free” to be extra “healthy”! Little did we know that that drinking a cup of dairy free coffee creamer masked by mangos isn’t healthy at all BUT that’s where to passion of making yummy DIY natural ice cream stems from! Just messing around experimenting in the kitchen! This one here is purely 4 frozen banana, 1 cup frozen strawberry 1 cup frozen mango 1/4 cup steamed beet (optional) and a cup of fresh raspberries and a little beet for added nutrients and a punch of color! Moral of this rant! Have fun in the kitchen! Experiment! Even if the recipes are total flops, the memories won’t be! and more likely than not your going to find some new favorites and learn something! ☺️😛✌🏽💦

user_21;user_21150.jpg;Sunsets + smoothies, it’s a season...☀️✌🏽🥥 There’s no one else allowed to spit and dip their knuckles in my smoothies but you Nalu! 🥰✊🏼Who’s your, ‘ can do no wrong boo’? everyone needs at least one 😉 and what are we calling next season~ soups and sourdough bread? 🥖🥑
user_21;user_21151.jpg;MORNING ROUTINE ✌🏽🥥💦 By a show of hands,👋🏽🤙🏼✌🏽who starts their day with a glass or water or some sort of cleansing process? And if you care to share what that is, please enlighten us! ☀️I’m always so intrigued and inspired to hear what others do! Personally, when I’m drinking room temp water, adding a little lemon, maybe a little apple cider vinegar and some molasses first thing in the morning I feel at ultimate best! The other thing I do, is eat melons only on an empty stomach! I have always had sensitive digestion and knowing melons digest in 5 min where as everything else including other fruits take longer, they really do best first thing in the morning! For breakfast we almost always have a smoothie, the kids they might have oatmeal or toast too. (I feel better with just a litre sized smoothie) and that’s usually after the kids are in school. I try to exercise in the morning but if I can’t I do a quick dry brush (been extra into that lately) to get the lymphatic fired up (feels so good after) and do a couple push ups or something to get the blood flowing- I can’t not do something physical... It makes everything better and I know that about myself (especially if baby’s been up a lot that night)! For the kids I notice such a huge direct correlation between good nutrition and happy dispositions! If they are nourished and hydrated they are angels! It’s when do much breads and empty calories (cereals) take over that I start to notice their pep damper! And happy kids are the absolute best energy and makes life that much more enjoyable which is one easy motivator to feed them good! They also always skateboard surf or ride their bike before school to get their blood pumping too! So that’s what’s going on over here! How about you?! (I should note - Shem and I are about the same most days! (And I should note we didn’t always have a supportive start to our days! Use to be more like bread and store bought waffles and cereals) - but definitely gotten better over the years and it’s definitely made a big positive difference worth being amped on!😜🍇🍍🥥🥑💦 #morningroutine PS can you tell our kitchen is different! 🙌🏽

user_21;user_21154.jpg;"Be where you are🤞🏽🍭 you know one thing I realize to be truer than true the older I get? Life will never stop surprising you ~ just as you think you know what’s going on you’re kids get older, jobs change, maybe you graduate from school, maybe your health changes, a friend moves, new friends come, new life comes, you change, situations change, accidents happen, miracles happen, there will be challenges to over come, goals strived for, triumphs to celebrate, heart aches to heal, love to feel, moments you wish you could cling on to forever. There’s going to be good times and there’s going to be hard times and what I know for-sure is every moment is worth living. Lessons learned will make us stronger, feeling your feelings will make you softer, and being true to your self and your now will make your life unique and special to you! Finding myself needing this reminder today, to just step back, breathe in the moments, let my mind forget about my to do list more often, but enjoy the list too when that happens, and just be and feel these moments right now! Life’s to dang precious not to! hope ya don’t mind me journaling openly😌 PS how merman is Shem rn! 🧜🏾‍♂️ ya you ;)💙"

user_21;user_21158.jpg;TEETHING TIPS! 🦷This is how Nalu handles his gibbers coming in- motor boating 😂 1. With sense of humor! Can you imagine having your teeth jet through your gums? Sooo gnarly 2. Give lots of love! Cuddle and play as much as possible to comfort them! 3. Distract them- go outside, go for a walk, find puppies and play with leaves! 4. Put baby in a bath or sink to play through out the day (this is our fav thing to do lately at home) 5. I am a true believer in Amber Beads! Before we had the necklace he cried when he felt them push in, now he’s doing this-laughing! Haha (we got ours from @summerandstorm!) 6. Bits of frozen fruit to suck on. I like using pieces of grapes the most because they don’t mush into a big mess. 7. For all my kids no teething toy works so save your moola! (Unless you know a good one to recommend?) wet clean wash clothes are magic tho right?? 8. It’s good for them to gnaw on things, helps get those teeth through so we let him gnaw on our knuckles and knees and give him cold apples, and really anything he wants and is safe! Anything but my nipples 😭😭😭😭) he has 4 teeth coming in right now! 9. For the parents- if you’re borderline zombie and feeling like your falling apart- try and take turns to get a little alone time and recharge. This is soooo important to me to be the best mom I can. Almost every day I do something for 45-1 hour for me, by myself. Its good for you and it’s good for your family! If I have to do it at 5 am to get this time I do it. And for me it’s exercise that keeps me feeling good, (and actually gives me a lot of energy) but for someone else that might be taking a nap, or going for lunch or whatever! Anyways I hope you enjoyed these tips! If you have some to add or find any of these to work for you do share for all the mammas wondering!!
user_21;user_21159.jpg;EAT MY EARTH in all its rainbow abundance! Who wants a taste of the BLUE LAND BOWL! 🥥💦 So it’s been a solid week of #eatmyearth where the goal was to consciously eat more things from the earth and I’m curious how was your experience?! Did you enjoy it? Did you find some new foods or recipes to love? Did you notice a difference in your digestion, energy, or find a desire to continue on? Did you notice a decrease in waste of plastics by chance? That’s one thing that surprised me when I started- how little I had to change out the garage bin! Anyways!

The way Nalu can vibrate his lips thinking he’s talking , the sound of rain and roosters as my wake up call, and cereal on top of my hot chocolate and smoothies 😋!

user_21;user_21161.jpg;Let’s talk about Vitamins! ✌🏽🍊Should you take a multivitamin? Did you take a prenatal? What’s your take? Personally I think it’s a good idea to support your health efforts with a quality vitamin (vegan or not). It helps fill in the gaps and if you're taking a high quality one like @ritual then your body can get the most out of it! Certain vitamins are hard to get solely from diet such as B12, and Vitamin D. @ritual is a great clean vegan non gmo option to meet your vitamin needs. A lot of brands have fillers and additives that you want to avoid and if you research this brand I think you’ll be very pleased at what you find! If you want to try them out they are offering all of you 10% off your first 3 months! Just use code EARTHYANDY✌ #ritualpartner #ad

user_21;user_21163.jpg;Fuel the DAYs! 🥬🥭🥥 Let’s change the challenge this week from #eatyogreens to #eatmyearth! A seven day challenge to make more diet choices that come straight from the earth! So not just greens but all the rainbow choices of fruits, legumes, greens and grains! 🍠🥒🥔🥕🥥🍓🍉🍋What is it that motivates your diet choices? Is it for health🏄🏽‍♀️🧘🏽‍♂️, for the environment💚🌍♻️, ethics 🐷🐮or maybe you havnt given it much thought to date? 🤷🏼‍♀️I’m quite curious what’s most important to you if your willing to share! One thing I know is having reasons makes it much more easy to stick to your health choices. It becomes less of a ‘I can’t have situation to a ‘I want to have this instead situation’. For instance- Did you know that limiting our consumption of meat is the easiest and more impactful way to reduce our carbon foot prints? Knowing this helps my decision process when making consumer choices for myself and family. So this challenge- eat at least one plant based meal every day! Share it in your stories or posts or in the comments using #eatmyearth! Woohoo!! PS these are our daily smoothie combos! Also a tip- I love using almost Or oat milk for many of my creamy smoothies but I cheaper way to get the same results is use a plant based multivitamin protein powder with water! Or extra bananas with water always works too!
user_21;user_21164.jpg;"Whos down for a 7 Day #EATYOGREENS CHALLENGE?! 🌿🥒🥬🥑Comment below to join! Get a friend or mate and your kids to do it with ya! We will start tomorrow!

user_21;user_21165.jpg;What a wonderful world we live in, what opportunity we have to explore it, to learn from it, to share it and to feel of its constant comforting presence! 🌎Our earth is endlessly giving and the only way I think to truly give thanks is to respect it, restore it and do our part to protect it! 🙏🏽🌿There is a list of documentaries that helped me gain a greater understanding of how lifestyle impact as well as health and has continued to help shape mine and many people I know choices, if you’re interested I’ll list below.

user_21;user_21166.jpg;Marry Your BFF!🌻 ‘Are you really as in love as you look on Instagram?’ Hehe. Short answer. We best friends! But some times we fight like brothers and sisters! 😂Trusting in love is what made us tie the knot. That same trust is what sometimes couples have to fall back on when life starts throwing punches. Believing in love, believing in a life together forever is what makes the hard times turn into growing times and the good times, magical and meaningful. Shem and I have been married for almost 13 years!! We fell crazy in love and started our life together and things like agreeing on career paths, how to raise your children etc are big decisions that not always both sides agree on yet it affects all sides of each of your life. Shem and I are no exception to that! But what we figured out to be truer than true and work every single time for any sort of scenario is that communication is number one. Double sided communication to not just be heard but to understand. If both sides are looking to understand each other, want the best for each other and are empathetic and opening minded then that leaves room for a whole lotta more LOVIN!! What would be a tip you would give someone newly married or in love?!
user_21;user_21167.jpg;Love you from sunrise to down!! 🌺 Nalu is almost 9 months old now! 🥳✌🏽I don’t think I’ve ever talked about this but I get asked a lot if I had a vegan pregnancy and my experience with it. So yes, Nalu was my first full vegan pregnancy and I don’t know if that’s why but he’s been my easiest and healthiest and actually biggest baby out of my three! When I first got pregnant I was not 100% confident it was safe and spent my days researching to make sure I was making the best choices for my unborn son. The more I read the more confused I felt at first but then took a step back and decided (in a nut shell) that if I continue eating a nourishing balanced plant based diet and take my Pre-natal and my b12 then how could he not be nourished. I could spend hours talking about this and curious your experience! If you have questions feel free to ask! Long story short, I’m amazed time and time again how much power plants have!🌱🌿🌱We are heading back home today! California was a complete blast! Thank u @hurleywomen for a great time and thank you @ocean_dreamerr for teaching us how to make this beautiful flower crown! 🌺🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸
user_21;user_21168.jpg;If ya wanna fly, give up whats weighing you down! And charge it!!

PS - posting the recipe for the RAW MOUSSE in my stories now! Just screenshoot it👊🏽❤️ PPS is it just me or is Tama and Ira growing up so fast! 😭
user_21;user_21169.jpg;Double CHOCOLATE RaW MOUSSE CAKE! 🍦🤩🍫 Would ya like the recipe?! 🍯 Let me know! This is a recipe I learned during our travels! It’s a completely raw chocolate mouse vegan cake thats make with healthy whole ingredients but tastes like an indulgence annnnd is suuuuuuper easy to make!

user_21;user_21170.jpg;We have a crawler!! Ahh!! Or a scooter, not really sure what that is Haha! Crazy how fast times goes eh?! Feels like yesterday Nalu was born! Now he’s 8 months, grown some teeth, “talking” up a storm, eating solid foods (along with lots of boobie milk still) and just absorbing up his world every second he’s awake! Can you imagine if you looked at life with new eyes every single day just excited about what you came across! I’m going to channel some Nalu into this day and just be in extra awe, extra stoked and extra grateful! Side note! Any tips for baby proofing your home and know if a good high chair? We need to get on that ASAP! Haha. Hope you’re good!!
user_21;user_21171.jpg;BANANAS for da BANaNA🍌🐒 How to properly prep your nanas for your nicecreams and smoothies? The most important thing...freezing bananas RIPE for 1. best tasting 2. best digesting 3. and best texture! 🍦 A ripe banana is one that has spots on the peel and no tint of green. If you’ve ever had a smoothie that tastes chalky or is goopy and your stomach feels like it’s going to pop from aggressive bloat it could be your bananas! If they are ripe they will do the exact opposite for you-aid digestion and make your smoothies taste creamy and assure ur texture is on point! 👊🏽 Isn’t that right Nalu bear!? 😜 The way we store frozen bananas are peeled and sealed in a container ready to pop into recipes or eat like that (one of my kids favorite grab treats)- tastes like ice cream- and dipped in peanut butter is even mo betta 🤤🍯 we just bought a few for now but usually we go to the fruit stand and ask for all their over ripe bananas to get a bunch to stalk up at a discounted price! This is a kitchen prep must for us! What about you?! PS don’t you love Nalus lil teeth? 😂😭🔥
user_21;user_21172.jpg;"KiTCHeN HOME LOVIN!! 🍓Let me ask you cuz I’m quite curious WHAT would you like to see more of on my page?!

Kids are soon to start school, we’re ready to get back into routine, so excited to be in our tiny kitchen, shape up our health cuz definitely feeling the affects of eating out a lot living off snacks, not sleeping and just not drinking enough water etc regularly from travels! Almost feels like the starting of a new year! Hope you all are doing great and can wait to hear from ya! 😘😘😘"
user_21;user_21173.jpg;"A SUNSHINE state of MiND!!🌻✌🏽🌻This morning we woke up to catch our flights home once and for all and they were cancelled! 😅 So we are road tripping until we figure out what to do next and ended up driving through the most beautiful fields of sunflowers and vineyards with castles and villages nestled in between! The French Country side is truly spectacular! This mess of a morning has turned into a beautiful adventure! feeling charged by these crazy cool planet✌🏽🌻 Fun sunflower facts! Did you know the tallest recorded is 33 feet! And that sunflowers are a symbolism of loyalty and longevity! ✌🏽And guess how many sunflower seeds each has? About 2000! Oh and it’s impossible to not smile in their presence! That one is 100% fact ;) anyway, hope you’re having a sunshine state of mind, on repeat! 😘"
user_21;user_21174.jpg;Fly High!!✌🏽🦋 My guess is all of us have hopes and dreams ya? So what is it you think that’s holding us back from chasing those very things? Do you think it boils down to fear? Do you ever wonder how different our life would be if we took fear out of every equation? How do you think the best way is to do that? Maybe it’s telling ourselves we can until we start to believe it. All I know is starting down the path is the only way to have ANY chance of it happening! And the thing is sometimes things don’t work out but something else will, maybe something even better! It all comes down to putting out into the atmosphere the very things you want to attract. Where focus goes, energy flows! 🤞🏽🌊Which to me is the equation to guarantee end up ‘winning’ this game of life! Whats your thoughts you brilliant humans!! What have you found works for you and forsure hasn’t?! Haha! My boy Tama here is my inspo to remember to follow my dreams! He never holds back with the things he loves! #followyourheart  Thanks for the pic sis @breehawaiii xoxo
user_21;user_21175.jpg;Best Friends for life! 🤞🏽Tama and Ira are 5 years apart yet they love and laugh on each other like no other and that makes me so happy! One of the things they love doing most together is skating so here’s some fun clips from this summer around France! I swear every little French Village has a chapel, a bakery annnd and skate park! Haha! We had fun searching for and discovering all the little hidden gems! The kids were in Heaven!! Anyway! Hope you’re having a beautiful day!! Curious if anyone has had to buy anyone lunch yet from our environmental challenge?! (Check two posts back). I came close the other yesterday but didn’t! Cheehoooo!! It would be interesting to count how many times you woulda bought something single use or do! Let me know! I’d say while we are traveling and out and about it would be easy to do multiple times a day... but with a little planning it’s just as easy to not! 💪🏽
user_21;user_21176.jpg;Just in case ya need an extra reason to smile today! Pharrell and Nalu got you!!👋🏽👶🏼🐶 Who loves MONDAYS? And who presses snooze as many times as humanly possible?! 💤☁️😜 I would say I’m in a love/hate relationship with it but what makes it better for me time and time again are these 5 things: 1. breaking a sweat first thing in the morning - getting the blood pumping and giving myself a proper physical challenge. 2. Telling myself I’m pumped for a new week even if I feel a bit bla (mind set is truly life altering). 3. Make a list of 3 main things I need to accomplish besides the usual day to day grind stuff (and checking them off when I get them done). 4. Starting the morning with fresh hydrating choices and getting the fridge stocked to make beneficial health choices throughout the week easy and 5. Being totally okay if all my intentions fly out the window if things don’t go my way! (Being adaptable is a must to balance and feeling good!) How about you?! How do you tackle Mondays?!

user_21;user_21178.jpg;What’s in a clean Beauty Routine? 🧖🏽‍♀️🌿 Well currently anything  that can be accomplished one handed! 🤗 But for real, for me it comes down to simplicity over complexity, quality over quantity and true beauty shines from within! The best way to assist that glow is to 1. Eat a nourishing hydrating diet full of whole natural foods (My skin is best when greens take up most of my plate) and 2. A few simple topicals. My forever favorite, vegan clean brand @bioclarity which just so happens to also be super affordable for high quality ingredients! They just came out with their Dewy Dew facial mist that includes all the things I’d do to make my own plus their secret ingredient Floralux which is literally a green smoothie for your face on its own! I’ll tell ya more in my stories and if ya need a restock or want to try it they are offering everyone a killer deal! 😉 So happy to share as I genuinely love it! If you have tried it let me know or if you have any clean beauty tips, do share!! #allgreensnogunk #bioclarity #bioclaritypartner
user_21;user_21179.jpg;I have a QUESTION for all the MAMMAS! 🙏🏽🙏🏽 How did you teach your baby how to sleep? I am so very curious the methods (if any) you used to teach the skill of sleeping to your child! Nalu was a good sleeper (up 3 times a night (in 12 hour) to feed for most of his life thus far (but pretty bad at napping- only naps if I hold or stroll him since birth) and the last week or two he’s up literally every 45 min in the night 🥴 The more I read online the more confused I am on what to do or just let its run its course? The one perk I guess is ~ Not sleeping hardly at all has been a really good reminder of how powerful and needed sleep is. When I’ve been up most of the night for days on end I start getting emotional and just want quick sugars and even reading a sentence or concentrating on anything gets hard! Sleep is power! Sleep helps make good decisions! Sleep is the base of happiness and can make a huge difference in overall health! And not sleeping makes you look 100 years older hahaha🧟‍♂️ Sleep we long for you! Haha.  I would love to hear your take and learn from you! I personally seem to learn best from own experiences and would be so grateful to gather tips from all you pro mammas out there. I’m sure a few other moms or future mums might benefit too! This is a category I’ve never been confident in myself so thank you in advance!!
user_21;user_21180.jpg;If it doesn’t get all over the place it doesn’t belong in yo face! 🤪🍇 IF you had to pick one meal to live off of for the rest of your life, what would it be?!? I think ours would be Acai BOWLS! With....a proper avocado toast on sourdough bread with a dash of hot sauce, squeeze of lime and dukkah🤤🤤🤤🤤 or maybe a good veggie bibimbap! Gah this is hard! @sunsetbowlshossegor, you btw make the best açaí bowl eva!! No joke, consistency, flavor and toppings are on poiiint! 🙌🏽And on their avocado toast they put peanuts which is a nice little salty crunch! Gunna take that tip home! Kinda reminds me of dukkah. Anyway! Can’t wait to hear your forever meal!! Nalu had his first taste of açaí today! He got a little savage if you can tell 😂!
user_21;user_21181.jpg;Makin friends with the locals! 🇫🇷✌🏽💔 Nalu found a Nalu sized horse today!!Right after he blew out his diaper on anything and everything in his surrounding innn the middle of nowhere 😂🥴 Hey, Would anyone like a list of our favorite places to visit and eat in Hossegor/ Biarritz and some tips to travel with a family in Europe? Here’s not what to do- book anything last minute in July anywhere coastal! We tried going home the other day and tickets jacked up to 4K a piece! That is craaaazzzzzy! 😭 then we went to book a place to sleep and call after call we got the same response- full full full! Haha the kids thought it was pretty funny and exciting we’d be sleeping in the park! Haha Anyway! We’re here a little with a cute new itty basque horse friend until we figure out the best way to get home! Hope you’re having a beautiful day!
user_21;user_21182.jpg;#momlife! 🥰❤️ If you woulda told teenage prairie girl me I’d 1. see the ocean 2. Marry a surfer boy Or 3. Get to be the mom to three grommies- living on an Island, letting nature raise our babies, making açaí bowls on the daily...Id tell ya, only in my wildest my dreams yet somehow it’s all real😌 I couldn’t of dreamt it up better if I gotta paint my future myself! Here’s proof dreams do come true! Whatever it is in your life you want...go get it!! Just go get it!! And remember along the way that the simplest of things always end up taking up the most room in your heart! ❤️Grateful for my sqUad!
user_21;user_21183.jpg;"How do you do your melon?! 😂🍉 Perhaps trade out the sand dumps for a squeeze of lime! 😛 Do you Naluuuu!! This is Nalus first watermelon and it’s safe to say it looks like he’s going love incorporating more into his life ;) Remember a few weeks ago when I asked for advice on how to introduce foods to a baby for the first time? Reading your input was SO helpful! So thank you! It was interesting to hear the details from different parts of the world and very helpful! Nalu is still predominately breastfeed still but he has now tried avocado, banana, potato and now watermelon and it’s going good introducing one food at a time and waiting a few days to try another to pay attention to how he reacts. Hope you’re having a beautiful day! We just had an crazy good beach day with good surf and just good all around fun! France turned it on today! 🇫🇷❣️💦"

user_21;user_21185.jpg;"Tongues out if ya need an upgrade in HYDRATION😋😛🤪💦💦💦 How do YOU stay hydrated and do you notice a difference when you are? Personally, I notice a huge difference in my energy, digestive system brain clarity and overall skin appearance big time! I find is easy to be hydrated at home with my water filter and routine of water rich foods like fruits and loads of veggies but being away from home and eating more grains and cereals and a whole lot less fresh and not having easy access to clean water makes me realize what a difference to makes living an enriched plant based diet and having clean water at home can make! What a blessing! I remember when I told Shem I wanted a water filter about 4 years ago and he was like “huh? Isn’t drinking water healthy enough?” Haha. I thought it was a bit extreme too but the more I thought about it the more I realized that if water was the main source of liquid entering my body every single day it mind as well be clean water so I went ahead an invested in a good one. (He now loves it btw ;) what is interesting is many people have found a clean water source helps with IBS and other digestive issues as well. Have you experienced this yourself?! Anyways, feeling a bit dehydrated atm! Would love to share this coconut with you sweet Nalu!👶🏼 I’m writing this to help myself focus this week on getting once again focused on hydrating foods and getting in the aqua! Let’s do this! 💦💦💦💦💦💦"
user_21;user_21186.jpg;Mes Amours foreva!❤️🇫🇷❤️ I heard a quote recently that went, “an inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered!” What amazing words to live by! Going to remind myself of this very thing every time I think of some excuse to not do something I actually would love to do! 👍🏽 I find it easy to say ’ meh’ and let opportunities pass but life is way more fun and meaningful when ya free up your soul and invite in the unknown! We’ve been getting everything from blasting shivering winds, to heat waves, and everything in between and it’s all added to the adventure of being out and about in this beautiful country! Having a new born can make it easy to stay home and have things feel like an ‘inconvenience’ cuz ya it definitely takes more effort to do most everything but it’s worth it every time if ya just get up and make things happen! Yeha! Are you having any adventures this summer?! You feeling the need to crack outta ur shell or what? Dooooit! Tell me about it!
user_21;user_21187.jpg;Are you Italian because you’ve stolen a pizza my heart! 🤪🥰🍕❤️ 10 pm and still enough light to share a pizza on da beach! I’m curious! What time do you usually eat dinner?! 🛎🌮 (state where ur from too cuz I’m super interested if it’s related!) Growing up in Canada it was 5:30 almost always. Shem didn’t seem to grow up with any real schedule which was sooo weird for me to get use to when we first got married! We would eat at 3 one day, 9:30 the next. Gah! Now with kids are on the same page and eat pretty standard every night at 6. For me it’s good to have an expected “time” generally so we don’t end up snacking constantly. In France it seems most everyone eats at 7-8! What about you?! And what do you think is best?! (If you say, add why!) this 10 pm +++ eating seems CraY cray to me but rolling with it! Haha

user_21;user_21189.jpg;"HOMEMADE Vegan YOGURT🍦🥥🍓!! Do you want to learn how to make the most delicious and at the same time cheapest homemade diary free yogurt on this planet?! 🤩🍯 So in the past I’ve shared how to make homemade dairy free yogurt but I learned a trick when we were in Indonesia from chef @nowonlume! ;)👨🏽‍🍳 xo He taught me that instead of needing a high quality probiotic every time (which is what can get expensive) just take 30% approx if ur initial batch (doesn’t have to be exact) to cultivate your next batch! The living cultures will continue to live and do their transforming magic! You can continue to start each new batch of yogurt this way! The more cultivated yogurt you use as a starter will determine how quickly it will go but you don’t need much. (About 30% of your batch)?This is such a game changer!! Store bough dairy free yogurt is SO expensive and in my opinion doesn’t taste good but if you’re a person that loves a good yogurt parfait... this is gunna be your jam!! 🍓🥥🍦🍯 oh ya I’ll post in my stories the link to make the yogurt! NOTE: The type of probiotic is very important! We tried all different kinds and the amount listed is what makes all the difference) and only a ‘woman’s probiotic not a mans it won’t work the way it’s suppose to ;)👊🏽 okay! Have a beautiful day!!!"
user_21;user_21190.jpg;"“Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart!” 🙌🏽YES! Can you imagine if you lived your life without questioning, without self doubt and fear and went forth believing in you! If you could wipe away that one thing- “fear” would you be somewhere different today? Would you have accomplished more? I know I would which is why this is such a needed reminder! After all all great things in my life happened from following my heart yet this self doubt fear thing seems to love to creep up and make us forget we are capable and worthy! This wall art always reminds me of dreaming a lil deeper and living a lil freer!  What is it you want to accomplish most of all in your life?! PS we took this exact pic last year with Nalu in my belly! Now he’s out and can get barreled too! 😋🌊PPS Zoom in on nalus face, he’s amping!😂❤️ ALSO we are having fun trying some new places in between surfing lil baby waves in hossegor area! If you know any secret spots, dooo let us know!! ;))) #france #hossegor #familytravel"
user_21;user_21191.jpg;Forever my babe you’ll be!❤️💋 Early mornings with you’ ❤️you guys Nalu and I have been experiencing jet leg like no other this past week and not sure how to get past it! Do any of you have any tips? Having jet leg, the feeling of blah most of the day, and almost like your body is sore for no reason and experiencing brain fog is actually how I use to feel all day, every day. It was something I had to push through and being happy or coming across energetic was an effort instead of naturally feeling awesome like I usually do now! It’s been a reminder of what a difference it’s made in my life to go plant based! I never knew it was possible to feel anything better than I was and figured this is how it’s would be for my life. After a month of an extreme diet change my body started to feel energy and mind clarity and more happiness than I knew was possible. Jet leg sucks but it’s been a great reminder to how I use to feel all the time in the past on a standard American diet! If you’re a person who feels blah, brain fog, digestive discomfort, and fatigue, have you ever considered it related to diet/lifestyle? Do you think it’s possible to change it? I’m curious to hear your thoughts and own experience!
user_21;user_21192.jpg;OoooY GoooEY 5 INGREDIENT SNICKER BITES! Who wants some?! 🤩🥳🤤🥜🍯 Looking for something fun and healthy to make to satisfy your sweet tooth try one of my fav treats demo’d soooo beautifully by @elsas_wholesomelife!! EXTRA TIP- If you put in the freezer the texture gets next level chewy good! (It’s a must pour moi🤤❤️ All you need is medjool dates, peanut butter, dark chocolate, slivered almonds and sea salt 👌🏽 *and if you’re lazy like me just stick everything in the middle without melting the chocolate! Dates are natures caramel that’s full of vitamins, minerals and fiber! I love them for baking, smoothies, or just on its own but more than anything... like this!
user_21;user_21193.jpg;"French Lovers! 🥰😜 How do you keep the romance alive especially with a new baby? That is a good question and if you have advice Id love to hear it! I think the best way to answer for us is to say romance can be expressed in many ways. Like when I see Shem doing the dishes.. that right now is super sexy and verrry romantic ;) 😂... but seriously being alone can be pretty tricky to pull off and so one thing we have always done is start each day with a hug and kiss and ask each other how they are doing. The other super important thing is to make sure we never go to bed with anything unresolved. We also made a small rule that if we are going to argue it has to be in the nude 🤷🏽‍♀️😜 hahah. But even lil compliments throughout the day, and just goo’ing on each other and making sure each other knows they are being thought of makes all the difference aka never stop flirting no matter how long you’ve been together! It’s easy for life to get “too busy” and grow apart if you don’t make it a priority which is why it’s so important! Being on the same page and keeping our relationship a top priority seems to create the balance and support we each need to enjoy life and make all situations good and bad better❤️what’s your take?"
user_21;user_21194.jpg;There are always flowers for those who want to see them! 🇫🇷🌷 We are back in beautiful FRANcE!! It’s crazy to think we were here last year experiencing the most stressful months of our lives when I was pregnant with Nalu thinking Nalu may not make it, doing tests and holding our breath praying all will be well. 😭 And now a year later here we are with him, our happy healthy lil vegan chunky baby! Being here is bringing up some very strong emotions and feelings of gratitude. 🙏🏽 Not a day goes by I don’t give thanks he’s here with us. ❤️ I’m so grateful to be here in Europe with not a lot planned for the next month to enjoy! If you have any suggestions we are looking for some adventure!!
user_21;user_21195.jpg;You always gain by giving love! ❤️🤞🏽❤️ .  To all the men out there who give their time endlessly, get down on their knees to play with their children, who work hard, love hard and enjoy the blessing it is to be a dad, Happy Father’s Day! I’m so grateful for my dad. He was a great friend to me my entire life and my ultimate exemplar. One of the best things he taught me was how to make things happen for myself. He taught me anything is possible if you put in the work and see things through. I see these same qualities in Shem as a father and I’m beyond grateful my kids get to have that guidance throughout their life! Shem is a great dad! He truly loves our children, he is their friend, and he makes them a priority in his life and I couldn’t be more grateful for that! ❤️❤️❤️ #fathersday
user_21;user_21196.jpg;"TROPICS BOWLS! 🌴🥥 The best way to get to the tropics is by eating it! 👊🏽 ;) What’s your favorite fruit or the one you couldn’t live without? 🍉🍌Mine are longan, apples and mangos but probably couldn’t live without bananas! Bananas are the best base for creamy smoothies and smoothie bowls but if you’re not a banana lover, freeze coconut or almond milk into ice cubes for a similar affect! To make these bowls at home: 1 cup frozen mango 2 frozen banana 1 cup frozen blueberries or Pitaya 1/4-1/2 cup nut milk of choice Blend together and top with your favorite fresh fruit and in this case homemade granola! Im craving these so bad after a day of bad food choices and being sweaty hot from our day of travels! It’s amazing the difference food choices can make on your day eh? Feeling a bit bloat and blah which actually is a good reminder why it’s worth it to watch Food combining and uhh not eat chips all day long! Haha. Tomorrow, you’re a clean slate! Who needs a restart with moi?!"

user_21;user_21198.jpg;Coo coo for da cOCOnUTS! 😂🥥💦 I have a question for you mammas! What age do you start feeding babies? And how do you do it? I can’t remember at all and the internet here is impossible to look anything up! Nalus now 6 1/2 months old and I think ready for more than just breast milk! I’m so curious how you go about it! I can’t wait to hear and so appreciate it! 😘😘😘😘 It’s so weird I can’t remember what I did with the others. Mom Brain I suppose 😛
user_21;user_21199.jpg;You can’t buy happiness but you can buy a plane ticket and that’s kind of the same thing 😜🌴🌴 If you could choose one place in the world to go where would it be?! 🌴🌎☁️ PS ~ two more days to enter a 7 day vacay at @aloita_resort slice of paradise ❤️✌🏽 (see a few posts back) Shems parents left home today and they cried!
