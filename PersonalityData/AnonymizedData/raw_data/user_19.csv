user_19;user_195.jpg;If you’re lucky enough to be with your dad for Father’s Day, go ahead and make this Oyster Mushroom Étouffée for the man 👨🏾❤️ It’s in my cookbook on page 145!  The day my cookbook came out, my dad and step-mom flew up to NYC from ATL to help me celebrate. He even flew out to LA to help me with my book tour event here! And of course he held it down for my events in the A! He has always been right there supporting me at every step of my journey 🙏🏾 I’ve always known I can challenge myself because my parents have always had my back, and have been my biggest cheerleaders ✨ Thank you, Daddy ✨ .

user_19;user_196.jpg;As some of you know, 2020 marks the 10 year anniversary of #SweetPotatoSoul 🥳🍠 I was planning to do an in-person event in LA to celebrate, but you know…. Now I’m revisiting the idea of putting together event. Only now it will be virtual. Even more people will be able to join the celebration!  Is this a YES, or a YASSS?! For me personally it is a YASSSSSS!!! But I need your input. I want to know what bloggers, vegan chefs, thought leaders, and other inspiring people you think I should invite to share the virtual stage with me this summer. Also, what topics should we cover? It might be a multiday sort of summit, so we can have cooking classes, panels, etc!  To my O.G. Sweet Potato Fam, thank you for holding it down! And to the newbies, welcome, I’m so glad you’re here!! Here’s to 10 more years 🍾🥂❤️

user_19;user_198.jpg;I gained 100,000 new followers in the last week 😅 And now in the midst of acute grief for Black lives lost, hopefully a revolution, moving into a new house, motherhood, uplifting my brothers and sisters, connecting with my friends and family, feeding myself, and doing my job, I am exhausted. I’m also terrified that if I don’t keep posting my extra very best photos and recipes I’m going to lose everyone of the new followers, and lord knows I haven’t had any time to shoot new nothing in the midst of moving 😰Because we all know that Black folks don’t often get second chances, and must work much harder to get the recognition our work deserves. By engaging with my posts, YouTube videos, and blog, you are supporting a Black woman, and by extension a Black family. And I’m afraid that even as my work improves, I’ll still lose you new followers because perhaps this was all a sick joke. Any black other black creatives feel me on this?  BUT! I’m also feeling more inspired than ever. I feel permission to include topics about race on my platform without worrying about chasing away all the white folks and money/livelihood/brands. The part of myself that I reserved for my friends and family––the part that is political, well educated, and opinionated––can come out.  So here’s my plan to keep thriving: GO TO BED EARLIER (10pm, I see you!), EXCEPT SUPPORT (shoutout to my husband, manager, family, and friends who make time for me even though they’re busy too), BE EASIER ON MYSELF AS A MOM, and TAKE TIME TO RECHARGE *THROUGHOUT* THE DAY. That’s how I plan to make it through spiritual exhaustion while being my best self for myself, my family, and all of you 🌞 We cannot let this fire die.  Other black creatives: Can you relate? What are you doing to nourish your soul right now? How are you dealing with the sudden uptick of interest?  #amplifymelanatedvoices #blackgirlmagic #blackvegan 🙏🏾
user_19;user_199.jpg;I feel like baking today!

user_19;user_1910.jpg;What’s your favorite comfort food right now? Mine is this black-eyed pea curry with roasted sweet potatoes 🍠 Silky, tender, and petite, black-eyed peas have always been my favorite bean (nearly tied with lima beans). Did you know that black-eyed peas were originally cultivated in West Africa? From there they made their way through Egypt, the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Eventually ending up in the Americas in the 1700s.

user_19;user_1911.jpg;Hey! Looks like I have a few new followers here (over 25k since Friday 🤯). Glad to make your acquaintance. I have to admit, being in the food world isn’t easy for a black girl like me. I’ve been food blogging on user_19.com since 2010, and I’ve watched so many white bloggers sprint ahead of me 🤨 Since 2010 I have run a successful private chef company in NYC, grown a popular YouTube channel (557k followers), published a beautiful #vegansoulfood cookbook (also called Sweet Potato Soul), turned this blog into a 6 figure business, been featured in mainstream publications like @nytimes @essence @todayshow , AND had a baby 👶🏽 And along the way I’ve heard so many of your stories sharing how my recipes or videos helped you become vegan. Or how my blog or business inspired you to start your own. Those stories of empowerment and health are what drive me to keep creating even when I feel discouraged.  When I discovered this lifestyle called veganism 10 years ago, I couldn’t have imagined how it would transform and give meaning to my life 🍠 Thank you for joining me for the ride!  If you haven’t already purchased my cookbook, do it (link in my bio). It’s a great intro to my recipes and philosophy. Also, be sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel, Sweet Potato Soul, and watch my videos! Visit my blog user_19.com for even more recipes!

user_19;user_1913.jpg;As a black person in America you feel every act of violence suffered by someone who looks like you: murder, police brutality, segregation, fear of, disregard of life. The constant message is, “black lives don’t matter”. We’re looked over, feared, subjugated, and manipulated for profit and power. My way of dealing in a racist world is to vibrate at a higher level than the forces that mean to keep us down. When everything in our world seems bad and hopeless, it is my protest to take care of myself, be present for my daughter, recharge my spirit, spend time in nature, eat nourishing food, practice yoga, exercise, dance, connect with the higher power, and do all of the other things that make me feel JOYOUS & ALIVE. Black lives do matter, and you best believe, I am going to LIVE!  Black folks, please take extra care right now. We deal with trauma everyday. We know what a killer stress is. Do not let this country kill you. As you stand up for others, stand up for yourself. Put your oxygen mask on first to make sure that you can breathe.

user_19;user_1918.jpg;#ad My fondest food memories with my mom are of us sharing a pizza at our favorite pizza place in Atlanta. We’d go there every weekend after hours spent at the park with our dogs, and usually with my friends. I can’t be with my mom right now, but we’re keeping our tradition alive and making pizza at home to share over Video Chat! I used the KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer to make a simple and delicious dough, and the Fresh Prep Slicer to perfectly slice each and every vegetable for the topping. I got this stand mixer, the ceramic bowl, and the fresh prep slicer attachment from @BestBuy.

Just finished my 30 day plank challenge on the 31st, and I feel so much STRONGER 💪🏾 I’ve supplemented it with daily walks, near daily yoga, and HIIT workouts 💦 This has helped me get stronger and tighten up my post baby belly, but it’s also been crucial for my mental health right now. The other night I had insomnia that turned into a crazy 36 hour severe headache, and the ONLY thing that helped it go away was yoga! I just needed some pranayama breathing, deep relaxation, and time to myself. 14 months postpartum I finally feel like I’ve got my groove back when it comes to exercise and yoga 🧘🏾‍♀️ Linking to some of my fave online fitness apps in my stories today!

Come through with the #DairyFreeYogurt @harmlessharvest 👏🏾 They surprised me with every flavor of their new #vegan yogurt, along with the prettiest flowers and balloons, a juicy fruit plate, a record player, and one of my favorite albums on vinyl (Mama’s Gun by Erykah Badu). And the yogurt is bomb. Creamy, delicious, and versatile. I’ve tried every flavor by itself, and have even cooked with the plain variety. Pick some up the next time you’re at the grocery store!

user_19;user_1967.jpg;How do you roast your potatoes? I usually toss them in olive oil, then sprinkle on salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and cumin seeds.

user_19;user_1969.jpg;[#ad] Not sure if I could love a soup more than I love this simple mushroom soup. You guys know how much I love my mushrooms! This soup has got just 4 ingredients, but so much flavor and depth––@swansonbroths and great mushrooms will really do that to a dish. And you don’t have to climb the highest mountain to source these simple ingredients. @swansonbroths is available nationwide and you can use good ol’ easy to find cremini mushrooms (or whatever kind you love). Recipe below! #OnlySwanson #TasteTheSwansonDifference  2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil ½ yellow onion, diced 5-6 cups assorted mushrooms, chopped 1 tsp dried thyme 6 cups Swanson Vegetable Broth ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper  Warm oil in a pot, then add onion. Sauté on medium low heat for about 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Add the mushrooms, and cook until tender, about 5-8 minutes. Add the thyme and Swanson Vegetable Broth, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for about 1 hour on low with the lid on. If you have an immersion blender you can puree it immediately. If you’re using a blender, wait until it has cooled before blending. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
user_19;user_1970.jpg;I am so grateful for this healthy and strong body that has grown, carried, and nourished my sweet Baby J since conception. I miss that big ol belly sometimes. But right about now, #13monthspostpartum, I AM READY to get back in shape! I don’t expect to look the same as I did before, but my body is ready. My mind...well, let’s just say I don’t want to let myself down by not being able to stick to a plan. So, I’m going to start this month with a 30 day plank challenge. Everything else I manage to do will be gravy. Hopefully I’ll fit in more hikes and some yoga classes. AND my goal is to get to bed early so I can start sleeping 8 hours straight again 😅🙏🏾 Y’all, pray for me!! Any one else want to join me on this journey? Let’s go!!!

user_19;user_1982.jpg;#tbt to when I could practice yoga with Baby J 😅 I haven’t done yoga since November!! My friend @eunicewoods reminds me that yoga is more than the movement practice. Just keeping up with this little girl and staying sane has been a form of yoga 🧘🏾‍♀️ I have been enjoying our long walks and hikes in nature though 🦋 But boy do I miss that flow 🤸🏾‍♀️ One day...

user_19;user_1988.jpg;New moms: What are the most important things you keep in your diaper bag? I don’t leave the house without a wet/dry bag for cloth diapers, a change of baby clothes, my water bottle, baby water bottle, baby wipes, alcohol-free hand sanitizer, toys, a teether, snacks for me (usually nuts and dates), and a baby food pouch from @onceuponafarm. That last item is a must because Baby J is eating solids 3x a day! I love that she can munch on a pouch while she’s in the stroller or the car seat, and the mess she makes in minimal. I really like these organic, cold-pressed pouches because they’re made with pure fruit and veggies, contain no preservatives, and no concentrates. Baby J loves them! You can find them in the produce section at every mom’s favorite store: @Target  #ad #feedfresh #onceuponafarm #target

user_19;user_1994.jpg;My newest wellness routine: Taking bitters throughout the day! Digestive bitters help aid digestion by supporting the production of digestive juices. I discovered @urbanmoonshine ages ago when I lived in NYC, and I keep returning to them whenever I feel my system needs balance. Digestive bitters are made with herbs like dandelion, artichoke leaf, and fennel and can help reduce bloating, gas, nausea, and stomach upset.* You’ve probably encountered them in cocktails, but these liquid tinctures can be taken throughout the day straight up or mixed with sparkling water. I especially love taking them first thing in the morning, and after a meal! Have you tried @urbanmoonshine bitters yet? #ad #urbanmoonshinebitters
user_19;user_1995.jpg;Roast that cabbage!! I somehow always have leftover cabbage in the fridge (usually leftover from shredding it for salads and tacos 🌮).

user_19;user_1996.jpg;Christmas came twice this year! #ad @JCPenney gave me $500 to shop for all of the wellness products I need to reach my 2020 goals. Honestly, I didn’t know they have so many deals on name brand products, so I got a lot more than I thought I could.

user_19;user_19100.jpg;#ritualpartner Coming up on the 10th anniversary of @user_19 I’ve been thinking a lot about my journey. Especially the determination and passion I had to have in order to make it this far. I think the biggest reason I’ve been successful is that I’ve simply never quit. Of course I’ve gotten better at what I do, but all of the talent in the world doesn’t get you anywhere if you don’t show up.  Whatever you’ve set your mind to, don’t give up (unless of course, you lose the passion). Keep at it and you will be successful. It’s that simple.  Check out the interview and more photos from the Make Yourself campaign I shot with @ritual––the brand that makes my favorite multivitamin and the only one I recommend. In the interview I get into more about how I built Sweet Potato Soul (by starting small), eating well, how I hope to pass on healthy eating to Baby J, and my goals for 2020.

user_19;user_19101.jpg;Happy #veganuary 🥳 Have you noticed that everyone is going vegan?? I’ve gotten so many questions from people who are using the new decade as their opportunity to finally take the plunge on this vegan thing.

user_19;user_19102.jpg;I know we’re already well into 2020 😏 but I’m still digesting the wonderful year and decade that we just said goodbye too. The 2010s (the years of my 20s) were the best decade of my life! Here are some of the highlights that I will forever be grateful for ❤️. 2010: I started Sweet Potato Soul!!! 2011: I became vegan! That lifestyle shift put me on the path I’m still on today! That year I also traveled solo around Thailand and Bali for 2 months. I also started my @YouTube channel that year.  2012: Started my personal chef business, The Nourishing Vegan, and became the entrepreneur I always dreamed of being. I cooked for people, taught cooking classes, hosted supper club dinners, and led online programs.  2015: I lived by myself for a year, and traveled to Japan solo for 2 weeks.  2016: Got my book deal to write the Sweet Potato Soul cookbook.  2017: Maxx and I moved to Los Angeles from NYC. We took a 3 week road trip to get here, and documented our journey along the way.  2018: My cookbook was released Feb 6th, and I had an awesome multi-city book tour. We got married, and then I got pregnant.  2019: I became mother to the most beautiful, silly, smiley, and loving baby girl. Nothing can come close to the pride and joy I feel being her mommy.  2020s, I’m ready for you!  Happy New Year! I love you guys 😘❤️❤️❤️

user_19;user_19105.jpg;#ad One of my favorite childhood breakfasts was frozen waffles topped with turkey sausage and maple syrup. Sweet, salty, smoky: why is that such a perfect combination?

Sidenote, a #vansfoods waffle and vegan sausage also makes a quick snack 😛 #veganbreakfast
user_19;user_19106.jpg;Looking at 2019 like 😏 . Yesterday in mommy group we had to brag about ourselves and I legit froze up and couldn’t think of anything to say. But wow, I accomplished a lot this year. I had a freaking baby in my house, and I’ve kept her alive and thriving this whole time (which wasn’t easy). And I’ve had so many career successes—hello @wholefoods partnership, and new management with @therealdba 😎 I’M A BOSS. And in 2020 my only resolution is to live more in gratitude for all that I am and all that I have. This year was full of fear, anxiety, stress, and sleep deprivation. I expect to still be dealing with all that in 2020, BUT I won’t be consumed by it.  I’ve got too much on my plate to add a whole bunch of other “self improvement” resolutions. I’m just fine as I am. I just want to acknowledge that fact more often 🥰 Hope you can relate! You really are enough right now. Just keep shining ⭐️
user_19;user_19107.jpg;I’m on a Gratin kick! This time I really nailed the recipe by doing sweet potatoes, and making it creamier by adding @califiafarms oatmilk.

user_19;user_19110.jpg;What I require to stay healthy has definitely changed since having a baby. #sponsored Top of the list now: fresh air and time spent alone. As much as I LOVE my family, I need time by myself to really relax and recharge. How lucky am I that I can just head to the beach with a good book ), my journal, and my Naked Green Machine which is made with 15 different fruits and veggies?! I bask in the warm sunlight, feel the earth beneath my feet, and listen to the ocean waves. Ahhhh 🧘🏾‍♀️ .  What makes you feel healthy? I joined forces with @NakedJuice for the #HoweverYouHealthy Half Day campaign to encourage you to do more of what makes you––yes, you––feel good on your health and wellness journey. Naked believes there is more than one way to be healthy and every little choice can add up to make a difference. This Half Day (yep, even just a half day can do it) is all about committing to take the little steps to a healthier you. Half a day of time to myself is essential for my overall health, and even my creativity. I’ll take more Healthy Half Days please! How would you spend your #HoweverYouHealthy Half Day?

user_19;user_19119.jpg;[HOLIDAY GIVEAWAY] the winners are: @charlestonmary and @vegmelissa 👏🏾👏🏾 Cauliflower strikes again! I made the most delicious whole cauliflower piccata in my new @instantpotofficial, and let’s just say I’m in love! It’s such a perfect holiday recipe! The Instant Pot pressure cooks the whole vegetable to perfection in just 4 minutes. And the best part is you make both the cauliflower and lemon caper gravy in the same pot. That’s one less thing to need to clean. I mean, what can’t I make in this machine? Visit my blog for the recipe. Link in my bio!  Just in time for the holidays I’m giving away a brand new @instantpotofficial Duo Evo Plus multi-cooker to 2 lucky winners! This new Instant Pot is a game changer. I love that it pressurizes even faster, has handles on the pot, and has a steam guard over the pressure release valve. You need this machine!  To enter the giveaway, 1.) Tell me what you’d like to make in your new Instant Pot, 2.) Tag a friend, and 3.) Follow @user_19 here on IG. Giveaway open to US residents.

user_19;user_19120.jpg;How’s this for a Black Friday promotion: @angelaroi is giving my followers a 15% off gift code, and to receive it you must donate to a charity of my choice!! I choose @nationalbailout because too many Americans are stuck in jail simply because they don’t have the money to pay bail. Stuck in jail, away from their family, their job, their freedom. And too often it’s for minor things that disproportionally affect poor & black people, or they aren’t guilty of a damn thing. Use the link in my stories to donate to help people get out of jail and back to their lives. Donate a minimum $1 to receive the 15% off #angelaroi 👝 Thanks y’all!! #notsponsored
user_19;user_19121.jpg;Thanksgiving is just a week away! I’m so excited to share the dinner table with my family (it’s Baby J’s first Thanksgiving celebration) and eat delicious food. There is so much I have to be grateful for: my beautiful and healthy daughter, this new and crazy lifelong role as a mother, my husband, my health, my family’s health and the success I’ve had with Sweet Potato Soul in my 10th year as a blogger.  I must also admit that I’m very grateful that I won’t need to cook this year. I’m going to eat all of my favorite dishes from my cookbook –– Spicy Cornbread Dressing, Mushroom Étouffeé, Braised Collard Greens with Tomatoes, and Black-Eyed Pea Fritters –– but @wholefoods is doing the cooking for me! How cool is that? I designed the Vegan Holiday Meal for #wholefoods, and it is available to order and pick up for your holiday celebration throughout the U.S. and Canada. That’s right. You don’t have to cook either! The meal was available to taste at the Whole Foods Hot Bar earlier this month, and the feedback I received was so positive. So many of my friends, family and Sweet Potato Soul fans have already ordered their meals! Order yours now to enjoy for Thanksgiving or Christmas: 11/1-11/26 and 12/3-12/29.

user_19;user_19122.jpg;My resolution for the rest of the year (& beyond) is to speak more kindly to and about myself. I don’t want Baby J to grow up hearing me say things like, “I’m so stupid”, when I make a mistake, or “I’m just lazy” when I need a break and more support. I want her to follow her dreams, yet know that she’s already great ⭐️ And I want her to know that her value isn’t predicated on how successful, smart, talented, or beautiful she is. Mom life is teaching me the hard lessons, but for my baby I’m so eager to learn 💕 Who can relate?! 🙋🏾‍♀️ #mommymusings

user_19;user_19124.jpg;I remember when I first started my personal cheffing business at 24 in NYC how difficult it was to find my first paying client. I put up flyers, I did tastings at yoga studios, and I went to so many networking events (even once at 7am). I would go to my dayjob as a waitress at a high end vegan restaurant, and as I served my customers with a smile I’d be fantasizing about being my own boss. It was a struggle, but I was committed and had grit, and eventually my business became successful.  In celebration of #womensentrepreneurshipday @Stacys pita chips is bringing their limited edition bags to retailers nationwide. Each bag is designed by a female artist and depicts a different stage of a woman’s entrepreneurship journey. And girl, is it a journey! They are also celebrating and empowering women entrepreneurs through Stacy’s Rise Project which will award $300,000 in 2019 to female entrepreneurs in the food & beverage industry to advance their businesses. I love that Stacy’s was started by a woman. No wonder I love her pita chips so much! #ad #RiseProject2019 #helpwomenrise

user_19;user_19126.jpg;TGIF! These last couple weeks have been HARD 😓 I had a debilitating 72 hour migraine (that’s a first), caught a cold twice, have struggled to the core with mommy guilt, resentment of my husband, exhaustion from inadequate sleep, waves of depression, and right now I’m in bed under layers of sheets with what is probably mastitis in my very painful right breast ☠️ Not sharing for sympathy or pity (I know this too shall pass), but to remind us all that even the ones who seen the calmest, healthiest, happiest, strongest, most successful struggle off camera. You are not alone.  Keep me in your thoughts though. I sure hope I’m back to my healthy self soon 🙏🏾 Love you!!

For the menu, I chose the best holiday recipes from my cookbook. So expect a meal filled with flavor, depth, and a whole lot of soul! I am so proud of this meal and collaboration! The menu will be available to order online from 11/1 through the end of the year – stay tuned!  Also, from 10/30 — 11/5 the meal will be available in-store at the Hot Bar so you can try out the goodness before you order a whole meal to grace your Thanksgiving table!

user_19;user_19158.jpg;You know how I’m really in love with peaches? Well, before summer ended (😭) I went to the farmer’s market and bought a ton of peaches, and made peach fruit leather. Now I can enjoy my favorite flavor of summer for a few more months...or days, depending on my level of self control 🍑 You can do the same with almost any fruit 🍐🍓🍇🍒 I used the dehydrator setting on my Emeril Lagasse Power Air Fryer 360 to pull off the perfect fruit leather. Gone are the days of needing a separate dehydrator, a separate oven, and a separate air fryer. This appliance has it all, which will save you space, time, and money! Check out my previous posts to see how I used the air fryer setting! But first, on to the recipe for peach fruit leather: 4 cups seasonal fruit, pitted and chopped (about 6 peaches) ½ cup water Juice ½ lemon 2 tbsp white sugar (optional)  Place the peaches and water in a pot and bring to a simmer. Stir well, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice and sugar, and stir to dissolve sugar. Use a potato masher to mash the peaches. Season to taste with more sugar and lemon juice. Continue to cook for 5-10 minutes or until it thickens. Allow to cool, then puree in a blender or food processor. Preheat the dehydrator, and line the baking sheet with parchment or a small silicone baking sheet. Pour the peach puree over the baking sheet, and use a spatula to smooth down. Tap the baking dish on the counter a few times to loosen any bubbles and smooth the surface. Dehydrate overnight. Remove from parchment and cut into thick strips, then roll and store for later. #EmerilEveryday, #PowerAirFryer360, #EmerilMakesItEasy @emerileveryday

user_19;user_19175.jpg;Confession: I buy pre-made hummus all the time! Hummus is one of my favorite savory snacks, and now that I’m a mommy sometimes I cannot bear to remove the food processor from the cabinet and wash it afterwards, #truestory. But when I do make my own, I’m reminded that it really is so easy, and I like mine better anyway 😏. Of course sweet potato hummus is da best 🍠🍠🍠 Recipe below!  SWEET POTATO HUMMUS * 1½ cups chickpeas or canellini beans, or fresh or canned * 1 baked sweet potato, flesh (about 3/4 c) * 1 clove garlic, minced * 1 tbsp fennel seeds * 1 tsp cumin powder * 2 tsp smoked paprika * 2 tsp mellow miso * 3 tbps tahini * 1 tsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed * ½ tsp sea salt (add more to taste later) * 1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground * 1/4 c olive oil or water  Place ingredients in food processor any blend until creamy. For best results use home cooked chickpeas. I like to eat mine on crackers or toast topped with sprouts (these are sunflower sprouts), watermelon radish, or beans!!! #sweetpotatohummus #simplywasa #vegansnacks #thefeedfeed
user_19;user_19176.jpg;It seems I cooked up a little controversy with my last video in which I shared baby registry gifts specifically for mama. The issue? Some of these gifts are expensive services like a private chef for a week of meals or a massage. Though I suggest using a site like Babylist to allow friends and family to pitch in to the cost, asking friends to donate their time to cook for you, or inexpensive relaxation options (like $30 for a day pass at a Korean spa), it still made quite a few people angry that I’d suggest new moms have their loved ones give them luxurious experiences like these. I recommend expensive products often on Sweet Potato Soul (especially kitchenware), so I’m curious why these gifts for mom got so much pushback.  I firmly believe that women, no matter their economic background, deserve the utmost care postpartum. The United States, the richest country in the world, fails when it comes to providing paid leave and the best healthcare for new moms. For as long as we can tell, women from cultures all around the world have always known the importance of caring for new mothers in the weeks and months after childbirth. That it’s a luxury to be able to have a midwife come check on mom and baby postpartum, or someone (even a family member) to cook the new parents a nourishing meal, seems to me a travesty. All moms deserve quality care. I’ve been told I’m out of touch for recommending these gifts. Go watch the video and let me know what you think. Link in bio.  https://youtu.be/-AaOhFEoBO4
user_19;user_19177.jpg;The best chick’n and waffles I ever did eat 😋 I love using oyster mushrooms to replace chicken because they’ve got a great meaty texture 🐔 In general mushrooms should be a regular part of your diet. They’re nutritious and tasty without needing a ton of seasoning, and they’re so easy to use in place of animal flesh. Makes going and staying vegan so easy! Look for oyster mushrooms and other fun mushrooms at Asian grocery stores (shout out to H Marts all across America), or at the farmers market! You could even grow your own in your house for cheap 🍄 Google it!

user_19;user_19188.jpg;Can we take a moment for moms, please! [#wasapartner] I have so much more appreciation for my own mom and Nana now that I am a full time work-at-home boss mama. This is hard work! Some days I can hardly feed myself...and I make food for a living! With all of this new mom juggling I’m doing, I’ve been relying on healthy snacks to keep my energy up throughout the day. My go-to these days has been hand smashed Carrot Chickpea “Tuna” served on the Sesame & Sea Salt @Wasausa Thins. Simple yet boldly flavored, and nourishing!!

user_19;user_19190.jpg;Now that my diastasis recti is healed (thanks @devotedmamas) I’ve been so eager to get back to yoga and have my body back 💪🏾I celebrated my first class post pregnancy and baby with an amazing flow taught by @koyawebb at @aloyoga last Friday 🙏🏾 Now if I could only manage to get back on the mat. I’m still trying my best to balance work, Baby J, and fun time for myself. It ain’t as easy as it was before 🤷🏾‍♀️ But I want Baby J to know the value of self care and fun 💃🏾 How do other mamas make it work?

user_19;user_19193.jpg;Today Baby J turns 6 months 🎉 It feels like a huge accomplishment!! I remember those challenging early days worrying that I had made a grave mistake by bringing another life into the world. I was terrified about how I was going to keep her healthy and safe. Yet, all these months later I know that despite the ups and downs we’ll surely have, she’s the best thing that ever happened to me. She’ll always challenge me to be stronger, more present, more intentional, and more loving. And the world is a better place now that she’s in it ✨ A peach pie to celebrate sounds quite nice 🍑 Haha! Link to the recipe in my bio or copy this ——> http://bit.ly/theveganpeachpie
user_19;user_19194.jpg;[#ad] Pro tip: For the best peach pie and cobbler ask the peach vendor at your local farmer’s market if they have any overripe or bruised peaches. These are the sweetest, and perfect for baking. Save the pretty ones for snacking 🍑  Another pro tip: Use extra cold butter and water when making your pie crust. No need to use dairy butter when you can use the new #PlantButter from @countrycrock. It’s vegan, tastes just like butter, generates 55% less greenhouse gas emissions, and makes a super flaky pie crust.  Don’t let peach season end without making this incredible vegan peach pie!

user_19;user_19199.jpg;This right here ✨ It’s been one of those weeks. And right about now I’m feeling exhausted 😩 But even though I feel like there’s no time for anything except work, I make myself one huge salad a day and eat it sitting down—most likely while breastfeeding & answering emails, #multitaskingmama boss.  This hearty beet & potato salad has been my best buddy this week 🥬 It’s easy to make and super nourishing, plus it gives me the energy I’ve needed to keep going. I think you’ll enjoy it too.
