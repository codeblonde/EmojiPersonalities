They tell us when one of our needs is not being met, or a personal boundary has been crossed. ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ I have noticed for myself that anxiety in particular shows up when i am either bulldozing myself (not respecting my own boundaries) or feel stressed about being able to cope with a future event. ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Anxiety is probably one of the hardest emotions to pin down as to what it’s trying to tell me. So here are some tools that i have found really work to help shift through it:⁣ ⁣ ⁣ 1. Sit down in meditation and focus fully on all the sensations you feel in your body. ⁣ ⁣ 2. Notice where you feel the anxiety in my body - for me it’s always my heart centre⁣ ⁣ 3. Ask your anxiety (out loud or in your head) what is it trying to tell you, why is it here? What does it want you to do?⁣ ⁣ 4. Write everything out in your journal⁣ ⁣ 5. Now that you know WHY you feel anxious; take a moment to reassure yourself. Always be kind on yourself. You could tell yourself: feeling this way makes complete sense, seeing the circumstances. Validate your feelings. ⁣ ⁣ 6. once you have done that, ask yourself: what is something i can do in this moment to help me honour the anxiety’s message? What can i do to shift? What action can i take that feels aligned?⁣ ⁣ ⁣ The action steps that came out of this little exercise will differ from person to person and from moment to moment. Sometimes it’ll look like cancelling plans because you feel overwhelmed, or asking for help from a loved one. Maybe it looks like asking for advice or researching a certain topic. ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ But the best way to shift out of any uncomfortable emotion is a combination of self-validation + taking action 🦋"

I think i was slightly delusional and in denial that my cfs wouldn’t interfere but I wanted to at least try. 😅⁣ ⁣ Not even four days in, my body started protesting. It made me sad because mentally i feel so inspired, but physically i just couldn’t keep up. ⁣ ⁣ Instead of forcing my way through it, i am surrendering to this experience. It’s a constant balance between rest and action. ⁣ ⁣ And I am so happy of how far i have come, because a year ago i would have pushed through. The difference now is that i promised myself that i would always put my health as first priority no matter how inspired i feel to work. ⁣ ⁣ Growth isn’t always visible, sometimes it’s a metamorphosis of the mind 🦋 ⁣ .⁣ .⁣ .⁣ .⁣ .⁣ #yogalife #selfcarehacks #yogainstructor #backbendlove #yogaathome #stressmanagement #yogaforthesoul #yogafromhome #yogajourney #yogainspiration #theuniversehasyourback #growthmindset #howtoloveyourself #spiritualgrowth #spiritualist #selfempowerment #meditation #selflove #raiseyourvibration #spiritualjourney #lightworker #spiritualawakening #higherconsciousness
user_31;user_312.jpg;I constantly have to remind myself that just because something isn’t working out right now, it doesn’t mean it’s not meant to be. If something is not quite going to plan, change the plan, not the destination. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new approaches and make changes along the way. So often i have an idea in my mind of how i want to get somewhere and most of the times life takes me on a different route. But that doesn’t mean the destination has changed. Trust that as long as you keep your focus, you’ll get there 🦋

A lot of girls reached out to me in the dm’s saying they have experienced similar encounters. And it wasn’t my first one either. ⁣ ⁣ I remember about three years ago i was at an ayahuasca weekend and we were going to do an ‘energetic cleansing’. The whole group had to divide into pairs and one person would sweep the other person’s energy field. There was one guy in the group that had been eyeing me the whole weekend and i REALLY DID NOT want to end up with him in the pair. But before i knew everyone had already found a partner and he was walking towards me. I didn’t feel comfortable around him. His energy was very overpowering and intrusive but i agreed on doing the exercise together anyways because i didn’t want to be mean and reject him just based on my intuition telling me something was off about him. When it was his time to ‘sweep my energy field’ he decided to lightly stroke my whole body - and i mean butt and up my thighs included. I felt SO uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because i didn’t want to cause a scene. ⁣ ⁣ Afterwards i opened up to one of the organisers of the weekend and told her what happened. And what she told me was so simple but powerful. She told me that i should have made a scene. “Who cares what other people think - if someone is making you uncomfortable, you tell them because no one will be able to do it for you. You cause a big scene if you have to. You could have even just said ‘no’ when he asked to form a pair with you - you don’t even owe him an explanation. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to.”⁣ ⁣ It was almost as though i was waiting for someone to give me permission to stand my ground and protect my own boundaries. ⁣ ⁣ CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS 🦋 . . 📸 by @daria_szotek
user_31;user_314.jpg;Three steps to re-connect to the present moment when you feel overwhelmed. ⁣ ⁣ One good thing about my chronic fatigue healing journey is that it taught me to become super in-tune with my body and my state of my mind. ⁣ ⁣ Here’s what i like to do to re-ground myself in the present moment when i start feeling overwhelmed:⁣ ⁣ 1. bring the focus back on your body. When you feel overwhelmed you are most likely stuck in a whirlwind of thoughts. Bringing the focus back to your body brings you straight back to the ‘now’. You can do this by gently tapping parts of your body (like with EFT) and tell yourself while tapping ‘i am tapping my collarbone’, ‘i am tapping my right forearm’ and so forth. It might seem silly but it really helps with rooting down. Do this for at least 3 minutes, longer if you want to. ⁣ ⁣ 2. Next step is to focus on your breath. Bring one hand to your heart and the other to your belly. When breathing in, first breathe into your belly, trying to move your lower hand with your belly. Once you can’t expand your belly any further, fill up your chest, trying to move the top hand with your chest. To exhale, empty out your chest first, then your belly. If you want to take it a step further, try to make your exhales longer than your inhales. I like to inhale for 4 slow counts and exhale for 6. ⁣ ⁣ 3. Last step: take out a journal and start writing down everything that’s on your mind. Once you have ‘dumped’ everything onto the paper, brainstorm on some ways you can deal with the current situation. You are looking for small action steps that will help you lessen the load, or help you cope with it better. ⁣ ⁣ What are your go-to rituals to help deal with overwhelm?

It’s a completely self-paced course that dives deep into our inner critic, how to make friends with her and how to rebuild your confidence. We also have monthly virtual women circles, a facebook group and a telegram chat to stay connected to the other women in the course. This course includes EVERYTHING that i did to finally start feeling at ease in my own being. And let me tell you, it took me *years* of trial and error to find the tools that really helped me feel good about myself. There is also a lot of BONUS content: extra journalling prompt to get to know yourself better, 6 guided meditations (voiced by me), a flow chart on how to get to the bottom of your emotions AND the funnest part: a one day mini retreat ebook, which talks all about self-care and how to plan an at-home retreat. If you want a chance to win the free spot for yourself and a friend: tag your favourite friend in the comments and like this post. You can comment as many times as you want! I’ll pick the winners this friday (so two days from now). Good luck!

user_31;user_317.jpg;•Confessions • I am not always the best at listening when someone asks me difficult questions. All too often i catch myself getting defensive. You’d think after years of self-exploration and spiritual practices i’d have an easy time letting go of my ego and accepting when i am wrong 😅 i could go all spiritual bypassing on you and say it’s the stubborn taurus in me but let’s be real it’s just me 😂 i feel like as humans we don’t like to be told we are wrong. We like to come to that conclusion on our own terms, preferably somewhere away from the public. I guess i fear being shamed for the fact that i was mistaken. And i really don’t like the feeling of getting lectured (i mean who does right?). It’s something i am still unpacking. I guess a lot of it has to do with wanting to be seen as a good person and having autonomy over my choices, not being pushed or forced into a certain direction but coming to it through my own research. I am learning and growing. And trying to figure out how to respond from a place of curiosity and openness. 💛 . . . #selfreflection #spiritualgrowth #lifelessons #bohominimal #vegansofuk #veganselfie #mirrorselfie📷 #curtainbangs
user_31;user_318.jpg;I had a conversation with someone the other week about food habits and it made me realise i rarely crave junk food. The only things i’ll crave are salt&vinegar crips and sweet&salty popcorn. But that’s as ‘junky’ as it gets. And i have them maybe once every other week. My body mainly craves wholefoods on a daily basis because that’s what i’ve been feeding it for years now. I also feel like your gut microbes play a big part in what you’ll crave. If you keep eating junk, you keep feeding those bacteria who thrive on it and they’ll create cravings for those foods once you stop eating them. There is also the whole mental aspect of using food for comfort to soothe our emotions. So that’s why it takes a while to get to a place where your body craves wholefoods instead of processed foods. It takes a while for your gut to adjust to these new foods AND of course learning to cope with your emotions without relying on food to numb yourself takes time too. So don’t be too harsh on yourself and definitely don’t see it as something to ‘perfect’. Everything in moderation is key ✨ . . . #wholefoodsplantbased #plantbaseddiet #plantbasednutrition #veganfoodshare #buddhabowl #healthyeatinghabits #healthyeatingtips #vegandiet
user_31;user_319.jpg;What a week it has been! I am still trying to figure out how to start posting normally again while also not coming across as tone deaf. Something really important i heard someone say on here is that it’s not a sprint but a marathon. It’s better to take your time to take it all in and to allow it to truly change you, than to quickly post some things and then forget about it. We want lasting change. I will continue to post about racism and #blacklivesmatter in my stories because that’s where i get the most engagement (which means i reach more people through my stories than my posts). And i created a saved highlight for those wanting to learn more about it. 🖤 I hope everyone is doing well and also taking care of their mental health while all of this is unfolding with such intensity.

user_31;user_3110.jpg;Part 2: how to connect to your masculine energy (for those like me who live in their feminine 24/7 😅) Just a lil recap, the masculine energy embodies structure and direction. Think milestones, goals, logic, making things happen (vs going with the flow), groundedness, ... So here are some things i like to do to connect to that energy within me:  1. Creating weekly schedules: for example on mondays i film content, tuesday and wednesdays are for editing videos, thursdays are to relax/meet friends, fridays are study days, and so on. I might still play around with this depending on my mood and what comes up (so i am not rigid about it) but having a set structure like this makes it easy for me to stay grounded and not get too overwhelmed by the week ahead 2. Journalling about what i want to accomplish for myself in the future. What are my big goals in life? This helps me create a sense of direction and purpose to life (so i am not aimlessly floating around 😅) 3. Having a few daily rituals in place such as waking up at the same time each day, having at least one walk a day, doing at least one thing that will bring me mental peace (yoga/meditation/journalling) and having at least 8 hours of sleep each night. Everything else i allow my feminine to fill in. You can think of it this way: the masculine grounds the feminine energy, it creates a container for it. When there is too much masculine, you lose your connection to the magic of life (the little things that light you up, the coincidences, ...) it is direction without depth. If there is too much feminine, you are not grounded in reality, you float around in your bubble of love and tenderness but don’t get much accomplished in the material world. Does that make sense?  What do you guys like to do to connect in with your masculine energy? . .  Photo by the gorgeous @daria_szotek #divinefeminine #divinemasculine #sacredfeminine #sacredmasculine #lifetools
user_31;user_3111.jpg;Ok so going off of yesterday’s post, here are some practices i like to do to connect with my feminine energy: - intuitive walks: basically, you go out for a walk without a destination in mind. Instead you notice the beauty around you, the flowers, the shapes of the buildings, the faces of the strangers passing you by. And you decide what streets/paths to turn into purely on what stands out to you. Let’s say you’re at a T section and the street to your left has a beautiful oak tree further along it, it catches your eye, so that’s the direction you walk into. PS: make sure to bring your phone on these walks so that you can find your way back home in case you get lost 🤓 . . . - free form creativity: whether it’s painting, dancing, singing, cooking, ... anything artsy but take out the structure. So maybe not a super precise mandala, but you could draw something more free flowing instead? When singing, don’t focus on it being perfect, allow the music to move through you and come out however it wants. Just enjoy it, don’t try to perfect it! It’s about the pleasure you get from it, not the end result. . . These are just two examples of what i do to connect to my feminine energy. Feel free to add to this list in the comments so people can draw inspiration from it! 💘 . . I will share Part 2 on how to connect with your masculine energy tomorrow in a new post! . . . #feminineenergy #masculineenergy
user_31;user_3112.jpg;♂Integrating masculine energy ♂  So much of my energy in the last two/three years has been focussed on re-connecting with my feminine energy. Softening up, slowing down, re-connecting with nature, not being so strategic about things but instead using my intuition and going with the flow of life. But the last few weeks i felt a lot of resistance to this. A part of me was frustrated of always been pushed to the side and not being listened to: my masculine energy. The part of me that likes clear cut rules, clear destinations, milestones, consistent action, using logic when making decisions. The part of me that wants to be an active creator of life. So the last two weeks i decided to experiment a little and see if i could find a balance between both. I have been introducing more routine back into my days, and in my work too. Did you guys notice i have been posting daily now? Before i would only post when the inspiration hit me, which could sometimes take days or weeks. For this little experiment i decided to show up everyday and just write whatever comes to mind. A blend between my masculine (showing up everyday consistently) and my feminine (allowing whatever wants to pour through to come through). ☯️ . .

user_31;user_3113.jpg;I am slowly falling in love with yoga again. I no longer feel the pressure when i step on my mat to progress to super advanced poses and honestly most of my flows have been super gentle. Only about twice a week will i do a stronger flow (usually no longer than 15 min though as my body is still healing). It finally feels like i am doing yoga again for myself and i am loving it. I do feel like saying sorry to everyone who initially started following me for my yoga content and my online yoga classes.

I decided to write a blog post on it (which will hopefully go live tomorrow) but in the meanwhile here are signs to look out for that indicate you are in a toxic relationship: You don’t need to hit all of these points to ‘qualify’ for a toxic relationship, even just one of these shows the balance in the relationship is off .  1. your confidence has slowly eroded over time : you were more confident at the start of the relationship compared to now. Usually this will be because your partner constantly picks on your flaws and makes you feel bad about being yourself.  2. you don’t know who you are outside of the relationship: your identity was/is merged with your partner - you look to them for guidance on what to do and what not to do. You don’t feel like an individual anymore and the other partner might even be controlling your actions and whereabouts. 3. your partner uses manipulation to get their needs met: this could have been either physical, mental or emotional manipulation/abuse. We all have needs (such as intimacy, being accepted, having a sense of security in the relationship, …) but in a healthy relationship dynamic both partners will openly and lovingly communicate about what they need. In a toxic relationship one - or both - partner(s) don’t know how to openly ask for their need to be met, so they’ll go about it in indirect ways using manipulation. .

user_31;user_3116.jpg;Yesterday while having dinner i watched a few clips of 90 day fiancé just to see what the hype is about and man, there are some majorly toxic relationship dynamics on that show. How do y’all watch that stuff? 😂  For real though, i got triggered after watching a few of those clips because i have dated people like that in the past and it’s hard to realise what type of toxicity you are in until you’re out of it. Biggest take-away for me though from my own experience is that a lack of confidence and self-worth will keep you trapped in those dynamics. From the moment your sense of self is tied to another person, you’ve got yourself a sticky situation. You might look at those shows and wonder why people keep coming back to those toxic partners, it’s because deep down they don’t believe they can do better. And most likely, they’ve never experienced what a healthy relationship should look/feel like. They have no frame of reference. So they hold on for dear life, hoping that if they stick around long enough the person will change for them and start treating them better. I have been there, and spoiler it never happens 😅 If you want to, i’ll share some more tips in my next post on how i finally found ease within myself and discovered my innate sense of worth. 💘 . .

It felt so right at the time to not have a set morning or evening routine. And it was a much needed break to allow myself to go with the flow and learn to tune into my body. But the last week i have challenged myself to a set evening routine and eating schedule (eating around the same time everyday) after watching someone recommend it in a CFS recovery video. And can i just say my body is loving it?! I thought it would feel restrictive but it actually created so much mental freedom and my body is loving the consistency. Plus i am sleeping so much better and deeper now.

user_31;user_3119.jpg;Yesterday was the first time in weeks i had woken up excited for the day ahead. The night before i had taken the plunge and enrolled into an online life coaching course. It finally felt like i had a sense of direction again. Since quitting work last year to focus on my health i had been filled with so many questions about my future. I would wake up anxious not knowing where to put my focus on because it felt like i was just walking around aimlessly, waiting until my health picked up again before i could make a decision. But the not-knowing and the lack of action i was taking towards steering my own future was causing me probably more stress than the illness itself 😅 And so even though i am not fully well yet, at least i have a vision now of where i can progress towards while recovering. I also feel like life has been prepping me for the job as a life coach after being thrown off one metaphorical cliff after the other 😂 I have always been so intrigued by the human mind and i can’t wait to start learning even more about it and helping people live happier lives 🙌🏼💘 . . .

user_31;user_3125.jpg;“I am not what you think i am. You are what you think i am. “ - Dr. A. Solomon  So much of this world is perception not reality. What people see in you is a reflection of ‘their’ reality not ‘reality’. If they see in you someone who’s not good enough, they live in a world that revolves around the opinions of others. They are probably constantly asking themselves: ‘Am i good enough? Do they see me? Do they like me?’. The things that pre-occupy our minds are the things we see around us. They become the things we judge in others and ourselves. Remember, water can only spill from the cup if it was already in the cup to begin with. Whatever spills out of a person is what was already inside, filling their mind. So take other people’s judgements with a grain of salt. And know that it speaks more of themselves than yourself. 🦋 . . . #selfloveclub #spiritualawareness #perspectiveiseverything

user_31;user_3127.jpg;Happy hump day peeps! How is your week flowing so far? My period just ended and i’ve had a few emotional days. 😅 I am not sure what’s happening and if anyone else is feeling it too, but damn a lot of old patterns are popping back up. Mostly around worth and feeling valued. But this time around i have been able to create space between myself and the instinct to react like i used to. This quarantine feels like a pressure cooker and anything that wasn’t fully tended to, has decided to rejoin the party 😅 The beauty though, is that feeling those emotions again is giving me the opportunity to sit with them compassionately. Whereas when the pattern was first created i would have done anything to bypass having to feel them. For anyone who needs to hear it: you are doing so much better than you give yourself credit for. We always focus on what’s not right yet, because that’s where our growth lies. But - major but - it’s so important to give yourself credit for all the growth you have already done and everything that IS already right. Plus there is no rush either - most of us still have a life time ahead to get it ‘right’ (if there even is such a thing). 💛. . . . #selfloveclub #yogaathome #yogapracticenotperfect #gentleyoga

I was always super self-conscious about dancing in front of people because i was 100% sure i sucked at it and i would just end up making a fool of myself. But here’s the thing ... why dance for someone else when you can simply dance for yourself? You don’t have to be good at it to enjoy it. Who gives a flying fudge (yum) what anyone thinks, as long as you’re having fun. I am 100% an awkward dancer and 100% owning it 😂🙌🏼 . . Did someone ever shame you or made fun of some aspect of yourself? What are you doing to re-own that part of yourself? 💛 . . . #selflovejourney #selfloveclub #integration #soulgrowth

Say the truth that you are carrying in your heart like hidden treasure. Be silly. Be kind. Be weird. There is *no time* for anything else. ” - Keanu Reeves . . Can i just say this quote represents all the feels i have about 2020. I know a few have noticed already from my vlogs but since my break-up, moving houses, putting more energy in my friends and myself, I have never felt better. Things in my life have just been feeling lighter and more joyous. After a few years of awkward inner growth i feel so good in my own skin again.

user_31;user_3133.jpg;... waiting for Rona to leave the party like 🙄 Actually last week has been deeply nourishing spending time by myself and getting a little routine going. I feel like life has cleared all distractions from my life through this epidemic and I am able to get my ducks in a row and re-assess where i want to take my life. I have also been exploring who i am without the presence of others. In a sense it has been liberating. The funniest part is that the older i get, the closer i get back to who i was as a child ~ unburdened by the opinions of others. Have you come to any realisations since lockdown first started?

user_31;user_3136.jpg;Our emotions are messengers telling us one or more of our needs are not being met 🖤  As humans were are needy creatures - not needy as in clingy - but as in we have needs that need to be tended to in order for us to feel like we’re thriving. Some of those needs we can easily meet ourselves - such as hunger, thirst (unless you’re a baby then you do need someone else to meet them for you). And for other needs we are designed to rely on others - such as feeling heard, seen, physical touch, ... There needs to be a third party outside of yourselves to fulfil these needs. Take a moment to tune into yourself and ask yourself what you are *really* craving right now. Do you feel lonely (need for social connection), bored (need for variability), anxious (need for stability), angry (unexpressed hurt/feeling unseen and unheard)? Find what lays underneath the emotion to resolve it. Maybe right now you can’t leave the house to meet with others, but becoming aware of which of your needs are not being met, can help open the door for a creative solution. 🦋 . . . #feelittohealit #bingeeatinghelp #emotionsmatter #divinefeminineenergy #sacredfeminine #lockdownlife #lockdownfeels #quarantinediaries #mentalhealthtips
user_31;user_3137.jpg;Corona has got me feeling ... (finish the sentence in the comments 😏). For me it’s been a much needed break to re-evaluate my priorities in life. With my grandpa passing and my whole social life being turned down to a simmer, it made me realise how much joy i get from the people around me. Connection is such an important part of health and having that part missing for the last three weeks has been challenging. In the past i would have tried everything in my power to run away from the discomfort, but with this ‘great big pause’ I am taking it as an opportunity to tune into those feelings and sit with them. And here is the funny part - once i give them my full attention they’ll usually dissolve within minutes. Nothing is permanent. You decide how long you hold onto things. The sooner you feel it, the sooner you heal it 🤍 . . #feelittohealit #slowliving #slowlifestyle #humanconnections #selfloveclub
user_31;user_3138.jpg;~ that feeling when you hit gold at the thrift store ~  Ever since becoming aware of the impact of the fast fashion industry on our planet, i have been very mindful about where i buy new clothing. It’s so easy to get lured into buying at places like H&M or Primark because the prices are so cheap. But you know what’s even cheaper? Hitting your local thrift store or going for a scroll through depop. Or why not host a clothing swap with your friends? I have found sooo many gems (like the dress in this picture) while browsing through the racks of a secondhand store. Not only do you save money, but you’re also closing the ‘loop’ and creating a circular economy where resources are being re-used instead of discarded. Sounds like a win-win to me 🤩✌🏼 . . . #secondhandfashion #secondhandfirst #ethicalclothing #sustainablefashion #circulareconomyclothes #circulareconomy #thriftstorefinds #thriftedfashion #thriftedstyle

I had to re-read that one to truly let it sink in. What is yours will come to you. And sometimes when we get too attached to the idea of having a certain person in our lives we loose ourselves in the process. Gahh this reminds me sooo much of the story ‘the red shoes’ that i read in ‘Women who run with the wolves’ by Clarrisa Estes. I highly recommend that book! I actually had a dream a few days ago about that story, woke up in sweat, just to realise that my dreams had spoken to me. .

user_31;user_3141.jpg;The last weeks have been a bit frustrating 🙈 after making a bit of progress with my health over the christmas holidays I have been stuck at a plateau for months now. And in April it will be exactly one year since i quit teaching yoga to focus on recovery. I have definitely improved but i honestly thought i would be in full remission by now. I guess life goes at its own pace and all i can do is try my best. But yeah, i wanted to share this because not all is always happy and bubbly in my life. I am really happy with where i am at in my life but also not, if you get what i mean 😅 I wish i could do normal things, like go for runs and work-out. I wish i could go hiking and travelling. And have a side job to make ends meet so i don’t have to rely on government benefits. One thing is for sure, i will never ever take my health for granted again 🙌🏼💕🌸 . . .

user_31;user_3143.jpg;A few days ago, as i was walking by the ocean through the pouring rain i felt an intense desire to do a lil boogie and skip to the beat of the music i was listening to 😄 The old me would have held back out of fear that people would think i am wacko, but you know when *that* song comes on and you can just feel your limbs’ thirst to be moved by it 😂 ahh how good that felt! I basically twirled my way back home. And right as i was about to walk up the stairs leading to my front door i saw two kids passing by, doing their little shake shake and skipping puddles with their lil wellies on. Total cuteness.

user_31;user_3145.jpg;"Ladies, are you living a life that makes you feel juicy, alive, joyous, creative, passionate and nourished? If not, what are you waiting for? Who’s permission are you waiting for? What’s holding you back in the moment to re-kindle that juicy wild energy within you? It’s actually not a rhetorical question, i would love to know! For years my reason was, there are more pressing, more ‘serious’ thing in life to tend to; finances, career, studies. I was hustling away at 100 miles an hour until life gave me the biggest brick wall to crash into: chronic fatigue syndrome. Oh and how i fought it and resisted it! Until last year i decided to finally listen to my body and ‘give in’. I took a break from it all and thank god i did. I have met myself over and over again since then. Always uncovering deeper layers and with it finding more and more joy again in my life. Many of you have commented i look happier in my recent YouTube videos, more at ease with myself. And that’s exactly how i feel on the inside. I may not be fully recovered yet from CFS but damn do i feel that wild fire within me burning again.

user_31;user_3146.jpg;𝕀𝕥’𝕤 𝕥𝕚𝕞𝕖 𝕥𝕠 𝕗𝕖𝕖𝕕 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕨𝕚𝕝𝕕 𝕨𝕠𝕞𝕒𝕟 𝕚𝕟𝕤𝕚𝕕𝕖 𝕠𝕗 𝕪𝕠𝕦.  I have been reading Clarrisa Estés book ‘Women who run with the wolves’ and there is a particular part in one of her stories that stuck with me. We all have a wild woman inside of us. She is nourished by living a ‘hand-made’ life. A life filled with unique creation and expression. A life lived on our own terms. .  When we repress our wild nature in an attempt to conform to society’s standards we end up starving her. And a deep hunger sets in. .  Because we are no longer feeding ourselves through creativity and living by own own standards, we look elsewhere for nourishment. And this is where the traps of life set in. We are so starved we’ll take anything we can get our hands on, without being discerning whether it’s good or right for us. We’ll take anything even if it comes in the form of abuse. Sometimes the abuse will come from other people or sometimes we’ll do it unto ourselves by doing anything in excess like drugs or binging on food. .  We have forgotten that we have within us a power to create a life that is ours. A hand-made life that fills us up and nourishes us deeply. .  We can set her free by returning back to our body, always checking in with our wild intuition to see if something is truly right for us. We can set up rituals that help us connect to her, like dancing or art. We can free her by channeling her rage. I mean who wouldn’t be mad after being imprisoned for so many years? Start asking yourself what do you really want out of life? If you could hand make your life, what would she tell you to do? . . The course ‘Self-love Alchemy’ i am working on goes in tandem with setting your wild woman free. Because it all starts with undoing the programming you have received and re-discovering who you truly were before you were bombarded with should’s/shouldn’ts as a child. I can’t wait to share all my juicy knowledge with you soon! . . . #wildwoman #wildwomansisterhood #wildwomanrising #sacredfemininity #divinefemininerising #selfloveclub

I can take care of myself. I can trust my intuition. And i can trust my resilience. It’s time to enjoy life again and drink in all of her sensory pleasures. . .

user_31;user_3149.jpg;Self-love and confidence is not just about healing your childhood wounds, but also about re-discovering who you are. If you grew up in a dysfunctional family environment, chances are there was no space for you to explore yourself and your preferences. Maybe there was a lot of pressure to be a ‘good’ daughter or son and doing anything outside of that narrow vision would upset your parents or lead to punishment. But here is the good news, you are an adult now 🥳 meaning you are no longer trapped and it’s now up to you to create the space for self-exploration and healing. When is the last time you did something just for the fun of it? When is the last time you did something new and unfamiliar? If the world accepted you as you are, no matter what, what would you be doing? Who would you be? Who are you truly, deep inside? 🦋 . .

user_31;user_3151.jpg;Throughout my life i have always had regular chase dreams where i dream of someone or something chasing me. It’s usually just me versus whatever is after me. But in the last few chase dreams there were also people helping me. They would show me where to hide or guide me through secret passages. I was talking about it to my sister this morning and wondering why these dreams suddenly changed. And then i realised that it reflects my current reality. I finally feel like i have a group of friends around me that i feel so connected with and that i can be 100% myself around. In a sense just their presence in my life has helped me so much already navigating the big changes that have happened. They are the helpful people helping me when i feel like hiding (or having a movie night irl to distract me from everything for a while) or help me with difficult passages (like helping me carry new furniture up to my flat). The chase of life will never stop but everything becomes a little easier when you’ve got little angels helping you along the way. 💕 I feel so grateful for getting to call these people my friends 🙏🏼

user_31;user_3153.jpg;I am not all things soft and pink. Sometimes i get really angry and pissed. And when i feel uncomfortable i swear. And i can be REALLY loud sometimes. Especially when excited or when walking into a freezing ocean 🤷🏻‍♀️ And sometimes all i want to do is hit things and scream my pain away. For a long time i kept that part of me a secret from others. I thought my anger would intimidate or scare others. It’s not what a girl is supposed to do after all right? 😂 But why should i dilute parts of myself just so that i don’t make others uncomfortable? It’s not my responsibility to make others like me or to keep them from getting triggered by the fullness of my being. Their triggers are a reflection of their own repression, i’ll just be over here doing my thing, and simply being me.

user_31;user_3154.jpg;I had an eating disorder throughout my late teens and early twenties. God, i used to hate my body. Well i thought it was because i hated my body but really it was more than that. I hated myself, my inability to be ‘perfect’. I had this deep seated fear that if i wasn’t perfect, no one would want me. I mean talk about major fear of abandonment. And the one thing i felt like i did have control over was how i looked. I saw all these pretty girls in tv shows and magazines and thought, if i could just look like them, i would be accepted. People would stop disappearing out of my life. I would finally feel whole. So i started obsessing over how my body looked. What started my recovery years later was ... anger. I mean a raging anger. It was like I finally stepped out of this bubble and saw everything from a larger perspective. I was angry at the world for putting out such a restrictive and narrow definition of beauty. But mostly, I was angry at myself for buying into it. I was angry for wasting so many hours a day obsessing over food and my body, when i could have used that time for other things. I was angry that i had reduced my value to merely my looks. I am so much more than the size of my waist. I was so fed up with trying to squeeze myself into a box that felt so suffocating. And so i stopped trying to become someone i was not. It wasn’t easy and i had many relapses. But funnily enough what kept me going was that anger. I honestly belief that was the first time i tapped into my inner wild woman. The part of me that doesn’t like to be tamed nor told what to do. The part of me that intrinsically feels worthy just because she’s alive. No other justifications needed. Have you met your inner wild woman yet? 💕 . . . #wildwoman #wildwomanrising #sacredfeminine #sacredfeminineenergy

user_31;user_3156.jpg;Do you trust life? Do you trust the calls of your soul? That little voice in your heart telling you where to go?  So many of us are told to distrust her. She’s illogical. Not based in science and facts. In fact, most of the times she goes straight against all of that. Move countries, she says. Quit this successful business, she says. End this loving, nurturing relationship, she says. I have better things in store for you, she says. If only you could trust me and surrender. I was terrified life would fall apart and i would lose everything with it, if i listened to her whispers. And it did. Life as i knew it cracked open and swallowed me whole. But thank god it did. Thank god it took everything from me that i was so attached to. Because once you come out of the storm, with clean eyes you see that none of it was meant to stay with you. It was keeping me, in fact, from my true self. Most of us love our comfort zones. We accept mediocre and ‘almost there’ situations because we fear instability and the unknown. But how are we ever to reach our deepest dreams if we never go out on a limb? You can trust your inner calling. That voice that whispers to you late at night. She’s your connection to the divine, the collective consciousness, God, whatever name you want to give it. She will take you on some wild rides. But the adventures will provide you with the fertile ground to grow and expand, to shed and to be reborn. . . . #divinefeminine #sacredfeminine #trustlife #spiritualalchemy

user_31;user_3165.jpg;Me being a happy chickie 🐥 because another bulk store opened up in #brighton 🤩 It’s so easy to get discouraged and depressed watching the news about all the ways we are destroying our planet. Some of it is out of our hands but for most of it we do have the power to change the tide. And it all starts with our day-to-day activities. Eating a predominantly (or even fully!) plant-based diet and eliminating single-use plastic from your life are in my opinion the two biggest things you can do as an individual. You don’t need to go cold turkey, and it doesn’t have to be hard.

user_31;user_3166.jpg;In 2015 the United Nations created the 17 Global Goals for sustainable development as the blueprint for humanity and a healthy planet by 2030. . One of those goals, number 12, is all about responsible consumption and production. And as it is Black Friday today, what better day to bring awareness to responsible consumption, am I right? . Did you know that if we keep consuming at the rate we are, by 2050 we are going to need 3 planets to maintain our current lifestyle? And no the solution is not to find more planets to colonise hah! Instead let’s create a more respectful relationship with our planet earth and find ways to live in symbiosis with it. . Head over to @togetherbandofficial ’s story for their tips on how to shop responsibly this Black Friday. It’s not about boycotting the sales, but about being more mindful about what we buy and why we buy it. At some point we all are going to need new shoes, a winter jacket, … but go for brands that produce sustainably. Think quality over quantity. Or even better, hit up your local charity shops, you can find loads of hidden gems in those racks! Also, ask your granny to fix up your clothes before rushing out to buy new ones (or if you are really handy, fix it yourself). . Make sure that what you buy, is something you actually want to take up space in your home.

user_31;user_3168.jpg;Even though i don’t have a set morning routine, meditation and breath work has been a steady part of my mornings these last months. Our breath is so potent at changing our internal state and so is silence. When i first started with meditation i relied heavily on guided mediation tracks, but these last few weeks nothing has felt better than guiding myself to that place of rest and contentment without any outside stimulation. Also if you are really interested in the effects that breath has on our body and it’s functions, google Wim Hof. I watched a few documentaries on him two years ago while i was still in London and his breath work has been so relaxing to my nervous system.

user_31;user_3169.jpg;𝕘𝕠 𝕤𝕝𝕠𝕨  A few months ago i was dealing with quite a bit of anxiety and stress. I would meditate and feel blissful by the end of it, but once i got up and continued on with my day, the anxiety came back full force. I always feel this need to hurry and do things as quickly as possible. So one morning i decided to do the opposite. I did everything intentionally double as slow as i normally would. My body loved it, my mind not so much 😂 ‘this is a waste of time’, ‘we have more important things to do’ ... ‘god woman hurry already’ 😂 That last one was a bit of an exaggeration but you get the memo. But i continued to do it and didn’t fight the thoughts (there is really no point to fighting your thoughts by the way). After doing this for a few weeks, I now no longer feel anxious when waking up in the morning. Because i know that i can trust myself to take my time and not give into the ‘hurry’ thoughts. It really came down to trust for me. Trusting that i will do what i know feels right for me and not giving into outside or imaginary (hello mind) pressure. If you are dealing with anxiety, i would really encourage you to try it. Slowing things down feels so nurturing and allows you to step back into the present moment vs. getting stuck in your thoughts. ✨ . . . #goslow #slowlivingforlife #morningmeditation #meditation #anxietyrelief #stressmanagement #intentionalliving #intentionallife #transmutation #yogaforanxiety
user_31;user_3170.jpg;𝟙𝟚:𝟛𝟘𝕒𝕞 𝕥𝕙𝕠𝕦𝕘𝕙𝕥𝕤 I always feel confused after listening to people who sound 100% sure of what they know to be true. I think we all want certainty and the people who sound the most certain get the most credit. But how can you know for sure - 100% - that what you think to be true is true? And how can you with good conscience proclaim to know ‘THE answer’ or ‘THE truth’? I honestly think that is why cult leaders are so good at influencing people - as long as you sound extremely certain of your position uncertain people will be more likely to buy what you say. I always have so many doubts and questions about everything. Let’s say - manifestation. I believe in it and i have manifested great things but i have never found it to work 100% of the time. Yet there are people out there preaching you just need to think about it enough, eliminate all negative thoughts, or step in the right vibration and it can theoretically come to you instantly. But has that ever happened to anyone? Has someone been able to manifest EVERY thing they wanted? Or another topic that used to confuse me a lot was diet. So many people claim they can make you thin and healthy if you eat this way or that way. And if you don’t get the results, you are to blame and not the diet. I find that the more i research a certain topic, the less certain and the more confused i become. So many people claiming the have the answer and all of them contradicting each other 🙉 I used to take people’s word for gospel as a teen and idolise them into something above-human. But the older i get, the more i realise that there is no such thing as one truth. And that people who claim to have THE answer are probably just trying to sell you something... I am not sure what the point is of this caption other than, i am happy i am at the chapter in my life where i am realising the importance of being able to think for myself and be discerning when reading other people’s opinions and theories. . . . #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #latenightthoughts
user_31;user_3171.jpg;Today i am filming a chatty morning ‘routine’ video! I have been really wanting to talk about self-acceptance on my channel and my journey towards it. I was so deeply insecure as a teenager holy moly! I felt so alone that i would take anything and not question whether the way people treated me was fair and kind. I would rather have bad company than no company 🙈 Since then things have totally flipped. Now i always ask myself ‘do I like this person?’ vs ‘do they like me?’. And this alone has changed the way I react to meeting new people. You should never have to work for people’s approval and attention. If they like you, you’ll know. If they’re playing hot an cold or confusing you: do you really want that kind of person in your life? No. So move along and know that there are people out there who will genuinely love being around you. Those are the people worth your time and energy. 🌻
user_31;user_3172.jpg;How do you let go of the path you’re on? When the comfort of the known feels soothing to the body but suffocating to the soul. My soul aches to connect closer to nature. To live amongst her, to wake up with the windows open and the birds singing their morning songs. I want to live in nature so I don’t have to commute to find her. For so long I have lived surrounded by concrete and neon store signs. Bright street lights and no starry nights. I have to travel to find her and I think i would be much happier if the play was reversed.

user_31;user_3173.jpg;Sometimes life crashes down on you like a mighty wave of chaos. And you wonder if you will ever be able to come up for air again. Allow yourself to be held in the chaos as you tumble from wave to wave. Resist the instinct to toughen your skin. The mess you find yourself in will shave the dirt from your soul. It only hurts if you believe dirt to be gold Trust that you’ll break surface once your wounds have been cleansed by the salty waters Sometimes you need a little shake up to find yourself.

user_31;user_3174.jpg;𝚏𝚎𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚗𝚎 𝚟𝚜 𝚖𝚊𝚜𝚌𝚞𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚎 𝚎𝚗𝚎𝚛𝚐𝚢  The feminine relaxes, sits back and attracts things in. Whereas the masculine reaches out, chases and takes radical action. Both are valuable and work in their own right. But i have to be honest i still find it hard to trust the urge to relax and attract vs. taking constant outward action. Because our world is filled with examples of how the masculine way is so successful. Even with the rise of the feminist movement decades ago we started working like men, instead of embracing our feminine energy in the work place. Things such as intuition, collaboration vs. competition, attracting vs. hustling are examples of how the feminine would operate in business. And i am slowly allowing myself to relax into this essence and find my own proof for how working from my femininity can be beneficial for me both financially and emotionally. If you know any women who approach business from a heart-centred place, please tag them in the comments! I need some real-life examples of people to expand my awareness of what is possible 🦋 . . . 📷 by @daria_szotek . . . #divinefeminine #divinemasculine #heartcentred #expanders

user_31;user_3176.jpg;Do you know what your purpose in life is? What your soul came here to accomplish?  Because i don’t. For a few years i thought it was teaching yoga but after a while that left me feeling empty. My practice and teaching became so alignment focussed that it started feeling shallow. I don’t want to teach people for the rest of their lives where to place their pinky toe and what muscle to engage. I yearn for something deeper. I want to help them heal their inner world. I have met myself in these last few months of my sabbatical. And i am shedding the beliefs and habits that distanced me from her in the first place. It almost feels like she is my natural resting place and all the conditioning that i received growing up is a cage that kept me from gravitating towards her. She is the pull that draws me to what is right for me. She’s my force of gravity, magnetising me to what lays ahead. For a long time i felt unsafe to allow the world to see the real me. And even now i feel weird writing this post because i have people asking me weekly when my online yoga classes will be back. I don’t like letting people down. But even more, i don’t like letting myself down. So for now, i rest in the unknown. Who knows, maybe my spark for yoga will get reignited. Or maybe she’ll lead me down another path. But either way I know that i can trust her. 🦋 . . . 📷 by @daria_szotek . . . . . #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk #yogateacherlife
user_31;user_3177.jpg;𝚁𝚎𝚕𝚊𝚡, 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚒𝚜 𝚞𝚗𝚍𝚎𝚛 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚘𝚕.  I am teaching myself to drop back into my feminine essence. To re-connect with my body and what feels good. I would love to always create from a place of surrender and inspiration, but the truth is that in the past it mostly came from harsh discipline and control. And look where it got me 😅 feeling depleted and sucked dry. I am working on trusting my body when it speaks to me. Even if my mind has different plans. Ladies, we are so connected to source and its cyclical nature. Our bodies, emotions, inspiration, ... ebbs and flows. The masculine creates dams to control the water flow. Nothing wrong with that, but i would rather harness the power of surrendering and ride her waves. Because sometimes that is the quickest ways to your dreams.

user_31;user_3178.jpg;Change is hard only because we hold on to our stories of the past. 🦋  Having CFS has felt like a reset button to life. I finally have the time (and lack of excuses, like work) to tend to my soul. I had always put my own wellbeing on the back-burner because there were ‘more important things’ that needed my attention. These last few months I have unraveled all the stories i held onto so tightly. Stories about who I am, and what shaped me. And even though there is truth to these stories and they explain how I got where I am today, at some point it’s time to let go. Because holding onto them will only keep me stuck in that reality. And I am beyond ready to create a new one. One where i feel safe to express myself freely. Where i don’t judge myself anymore, and i let go of the pressure to be perfect in someone else’s eyes. One where I know that I can trust what feels right to me and know that any judgement that comes from others has nothing to do with me. Did you know that a caterpillar in its cocoon has to dissolve into mush before its DNA re-configures into a butterfly? The chaos and dissolving of self is a crucial part in the metamorphosis. So allow yourself to crumble and feel lost. Soon the pieces will fall back together in a different configuration, and you will come out changed for the better.

user_31;user_3179.jpg;Being low waste on a budget is definitely not the easiest thing and it has required me to put my perfectionism to the side. But - it is not impossible! This week i challenged myself to shop as low waste as possible while staying under £20 per person and i succeeded 🙌🏼 There were still a couple of items in plastic (rice and frozen fruit) but all the rest was either without packaging or in recyclable packaging. I am so happy knowing that with just a bit of extra planning, it is 100% possible. The ultimate dream though, would be to live on a plot of land and grow most of the food myself. 🤩 I filmed my grocery shop of the week and the video should be up at the end of next week! 😘 . . 📷 by @yogawitholive . . #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #lowwaste #lowwasteliving #lowwastelifestyle #lowimpactmovement #bulkshopping #sustainableliving

user_31;user_3181.jpg;Do you believe in astrology?  I am always a bit skeptical and tend to have one foot in and one foot out at all times. The beautiful @daradubinet introduced me to astrocartography a couple of months ago. Doubtful at first that there was anything in it for me, i decided to approach it from a place of curiosity instead. Turns out i am wedged between a neptune and uranus line. When i heard Dara explain how a neptune line feels like, i kind of just went shit, that’s exactly how i have been feeling the last two years since i moved to the UK (both London and Brighton are on the same planetary lines). She described Neptune as feeling like you’re constantly being pulled underwater. You lose your ability to focus and be motivated. Even though you yearn to be seen, people can’t see you as you are ‘below the surface of the waters’. On the flip-side it bring many spiritual lessons of surrender and heightens your creativity. I feel like every time i feel stable again and i made a big step forward I get pulled under for another lesson waiting to be experienced. Apparently if i travel to other places with different lines running through them, i can tap into those energies and have a much different experience. So from this, you would think that i would be impatient to move to another country already. Just wanting to be freed from this constant pulling under. The funny part is that i have no desire in me to move right now. I know that i am right where i should be, because every time i come up for air, i am a slightly changed person. Or i should say slightly more myself. It feels like the neptunian waters are cleansing the masks off of me until there is nothing left but me. Let me know what line you live on and whether you feel like it represents your current circumstances. I still have a bit of skepticism in me surrounding it but I find it so deeply fascinating at the same time. #astrogeotravels #astrocartography #astrogeolocation #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk
user_31;user_3182.jpg;I am not here to get it right. I am here to simply experience. So often I feel the pressure to get it right. To make the ‘right’ decision. To say the ‘right’ thing. It feels like i put all of my trust in this external thing that knows what is right for me. And i should look for external signs of which way to go. But what about the internal signs. What if i decided to do what ‘feels’ right instead of what ‘looks’ right? Why can’t i trust myself to know what is good for me and why do i keep looking outside of myself for confirmation? What if it doesn’t matter if i ended up pursuing the ‘wrong’ path my whole life. Because who can really decide what is right or wrong for me, apart from me? I feel like this life is about simply experiencing things as they are. Source is simply trying to experience the whole complexity of life without a ruler in hand to push people in line who aren’t doing as they ‘should’. I also realise that this deep need to get it right and fear of getting it wrong stems from childhood and the consequences i saw other people get from doing ‘wrong’ in the eyes of another. I still find it amusing how the fears you have today are fears you learnt growing up. The amusing parts is that now as an adult we can do as we wish but we keep ourselves in the small prison of our past thinking it is still valid in the present ... . . . #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk #growwiththeflow #whenthebodysaysno #gabormate #meditationtime
user_31;user_3183.jpg;I am currently practicing non attachment with my yoga practice. As a yoga teacher I am used to doing yoga daily but the last few weeks my body has been asking me to step away from it for a while. It feels weird not teaching (because of my condition) and now also no longer practicing on my own. But it’s exactly what my body needs in this moment and I will always listen to what my body asks of me even when it makes little sense in the moment. So for those of you who started following me because of my yoga content, it might take a while before you see another yoga post pop up here.

user_31;user_3184.jpg;“I had to make you uncomfortable, otherwise you would have never moved - the universe” (author unknown)  Story of my life, hey 😄 Who can relate? I feel like every big shift in my life has come through the process of discomfort. And why wouldn’t it, we are creatures of comfort after all. Only when a habit or circumstance starts becoming uncomfortable or painful, do we get the incentive to change course. So maybe discomfort and pain aren’t such terrible things after all. They have always guided me to better places in life. 🌸  I am really curious as to where this period of discomfort now will lead me to. 🧚🏼‍♀️ Watch my latest youtube video (link in bio) where i talk a bit about what I have been letting go of over the last week. . . ps: my top is by @organicbasics you can use the code SILKEOBC3 for 10% off 🌹 . . . #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk #growwiththeflow #meditationtime

user_31;user_3186.jpg;Boy did I go through a shitty weekend 😄 I had a massive flare-up in my symptoms, and on top of that what seems like inflammation of the muscles of my neck which made it so hard to sleep because it would hurt no matter what position I was laying in. I was pushed way down under and for the first time I allowed it to be. I cancelled plans, I cancelled to do’s and I slept, a ton. I asked my boyfriend to make food (something I usually like to do). I did take a moment at first though to channel my anger and frustration by hitting a pillow against the ottoman a couple times 😄 and man, that release was much needed! I have never been good at processing anger, and usually just push it down. But the throwing pillow thing will be my new go-to tool to blow some steam 😅 But here is the good news, even though my secondary symptoms and the inflammation hasn’t gone down completely yet, I can feel that I have changed massively over the last few days. I realised while reading the book ‘When the body says No’ from Gabor Maté that I am holding so much un-processed anger inside. And that I also need to work on setting better boundaries and not feeling guilty about that. I can do whole post on setting boundaries and guilt 😅 actually, I might share a bit about that in my next post. But I guess here is the take away, I am starting to feel much lighter than before, more grounded and it feels like I have reached that tipping point where the mean girl voice in my head has transformed into a loving mother haha. No legit, it feels like I have been assigned a new internal voice and she’s so much sweeter now. Best upgrade ever… Reading Gabor Maté’s book alongside the trials of last weekend are surely to thank for that.

user_31;user_3188.jpg;* 𝕣𝕖-𝕞𝕚𝕟𝕖𝕣𝕒𝕝𝕚𝕤𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕘𝕣𝕖𝕖𝕟 𝕣𝕒𝕨 𝕤𝕠𝕦𝕡 *  My body has been craving this soup every single day since i made it for the first time. It’s inspired by @daradubinet ‘one true thing’ raw soup. I believe our bodies are so intelligent and communicate to us through cravings as to what nutrients they need more of. If you crave chips and cookies, look at what nutrients can be found in those. Maybe you need more natural salts, minerals or maybe your blood sugar is low and your body desperately needs something with a bit of sugar to bring it back up. The trick is to find alternatives to these junk food cravings that will be truly nourishing to your body. I have been having MAJOR salt cravings the last few months because of my cfs and guess what ... i haven’t had any of those in the last few days. Instead i have been craving this soup because that’s exactly what my body needs. So here is a quick recipe for you: - 1 celery stalk - 3 cups kale (or spinach if you are new to eating healthy since the flavour is milder) - 1 date - 2 tbsp pine nuts (or hemp seeds/cashews/... anything fatty) - Juice of 1/2 lime (or lemon) - 1 small garlic clove - a few cracks of sea salt - a dash of chilli powder - 1 tsp onion powder - 1/3 avocado  Directions: blend everything in a high speed blender with water except for the avocado. Once everything is mixed smoothly, add the avocado and blend again for a few seconds. Now pour it into your favourite bowl and add any toppings you like. I added some more pine nuts. . . . . . #rawvegan #veganfoodshares #veganfoodspot #alkalinefood #vegansoftheworld #livingfood #plantdiet #smoothieoftheday #alkalinevegan #alkalineveganrecipes #rawsoup #greensoup #veggiebowl #healthycooking #cookfromscratch #5minutemeal #dinnerrecipes #healthyfoodinspiration #eatgoodfeelgood #realgoodfood #nourishyourbody #detox #healthyway
user_31;user_3189.jpg;What does #sustainability mean to you? I feel like sometimes I draw it out to be this BIG thing. When in reality it lays in the small daily decisions that we make. You don’t have to be perfect at it. You don’t need to have a pinterest perfect zero waste life to make a difference. I belief that every small action towards sustainability is where the magic lies. ✨ Find those small changes that you can make and start from there. Here’s what I am doing: - bringing cotton tote bags when shopping - I invested in a water filter to eliminate the need for bottled water - I refill my detergents and soaps at my local bulk store - I shop mostly second hand and if i can’t find what i want I opt for sustainable brands like @organicbasics - Organic Basics uses organic and sustainably sourced materials, plus everything is shipped in carton, which is easy to recycle or compost.

user_31;user_3191.jpg;I started reading a new book called ‘When the body says no’ by Gabor Maté and this quote really struck me: . ‘For those habituated to high levels of internal stress since early childhood, it is the absence of stress that creates unease, evoking boredom and a sense of meaninglessness. People may become addicted to their own stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol. To such person stress feels desirable, while the absence of it feels like something to be avoided.’ . I have already been monitoring my stress levels in the last few months to make sure i always stay as grounded as possible but reading this quote put everything into perspective as to ‘why’ I ended up where i am now 👉🏼 learnt behavioural patterns that probably where very useful when i was younger but that are now taking a big toll on my health and wellbeing.

user_31;user_3192.jpg;I have always been a very independent person. As a teenager and young adult I learned quickly how to take care of myself and not having to rely on others. I think i got to that place because i have been let down by quite a few people in my life. I feel like my hyper independence was fear of abandonment in disguise. If no one could get close to me and i didnt need them, they also couldn’t hurt me by leaving. My CFS symptoms have been confronting not only because they have hit the pause button on life, but also because now I am quite literally dependent on others. It’s been an emotional roller coaster of sitting down with all my triggers and trying to unravel them. My worst fear in life is to be a burden to someone, and we all know life loves to give you exactly what you fear so that you can integrate it. I have to say though that there is an element of humor about it, if you look at it from a bigger perspective. I guess this is a lesson for me that you can’t outrun your fears and at least I have the most beautiful partner and friends surrounding me, who still love me even when at the moment i feel like i can’t give them as much as they give me. 💕 . . . #cfs #chronicfatiguesyndrome #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk #growwiththeflow
user_31;user_3193.jpg;Do you ever feel like all of this is a dream? Sometimes i’ll be standing in line at the grocery store or sitting on a park bench and observing the people around me All going about their lives, lost in their thoughts or whispering their grocery list beneath their breath. I am just a background player in their story, and they are in mine. Yet deep within them lives a universe as large as mine. The content of their internal universe completely shrouded in mystery to outsiders. I haven’t even explored the depths of my own, how could i possibly fully unravel another one? When I really allow myself to dive into the complexity of this life, I can’t help but laugh at the absurd genius of it all. Little universes walking around, held by flesh and bones, living in a larger universe held by deep darkness and emptiness. I can’t even wrap my head around emptiness. Just think about it. Nothing, not even air exist in emptiness. How can something exist in or be held by nothingness? I really do hope that when we die there is a person standing there (in heaven/afterlife/source/ or whatever happens after we die) ready to explain to us the weirdness of this existence. And if there is no one there to answer my million questions i want to talk to the manager and get a full refund, thank you. . . . #realization #spiritualpower #transmutation #spirituality #thankyouuniverse #createyourownreality #createyourownhappiness #embracelife #happinessisaninsidejob #livethelifeyoulove #raiseyourvibe #youarelove #realisation #planteater #veganuk #growwiththeflow
user_31;user_3194.jpg;I just finished reading ‘Big Magic’ by @elizabeth_gilbert_writer and love her concept that creativity comes to visit us. Its so in line with my chart in Human Design - i have an open head centre which means that i receive inspiration from my environment and therefor it is very variable. It’s always ebbing and flowing. Reading elizabeth’s words gave me a sense of relief because sometimes when i am working on a project and my initial inspiration dwindles i have a tendency to make it mean something about myself (such as i am not creative enough). Now i realise that for me its normal and totally fine. I could either relax and do something else waiting for it to come back. Or i can go out and do something that will increase the chances of inspiration finding me again, such as being around people, reading other peoples work, going for a walk in nature,... basically putting myself in a different environment so that i can start receiving inspiration again.

user_31;user_3195.jpg;On days that i feel pulled in all directions and feel confused as to where i stand in my beliefs and values, i always remind myself that i am a human SPONGE. As a projector in Human Design I soak up everyone’s energy, whether it’s people in my life or people who i follow on this social platform. When i feel confused or overwhelmed it’s a sign that i have been too much in other people’s energy and not enough in my own. The BEST way to get back to a state of feeling centred is by switching off all the electronics, either taking a nap, meditating or laying on my acupressure mat to help me come back to myself. And it works every single time 🌸 Do you ever feel like you absorb other people’s energy as well?

user_31;user_3196.jpg;I can feel it coming in the tsunami of questions and doubts what is my purpose and how do i know for sure this is it i have a weakness for wanting things to be right as if there is ever a right answer to life questions life is not an equation to be solved It’s not hard rocket science it’s a sensation to be felt and unraveled as the thread moves you forward yet i love to make things more complex than they are making intricate knots and loopholes when walking straight in the direction of what feels right in this moment is all it takes it can’t guarantee to me that what feels right right now will still feel right 10 years from now but maybe life doesn’t owe me any guarantees just like the ocean doesn’t owe the surfer waves. . . . photo taken by my gorgeous friend @daria_szotek . . #higherfrequencies #transmutation #realization #spiritualpower #affirm #spirituality #surrender #findbalance #movingmeditation #exploreyourself #followtheflow #ponderings #donthurry #wavesofchange #gowiththeflow #vegang #vegangram #vegangoodness #beachlife #beachlife🌴
user_31;user_3197.jpg;Sometimes i wish i could plunge into another person Swim with their thought waves and wander through their dense library of memories  Isn’t it crazy that there is no person out there like you No two are alike We are all shaped by the uniqueness of our experiences Yet we all have have experienced heart break at some point abandonment success loss joy bliss infatuation trauma  We are so different yet so alike And the more i think about these things, the more it dawns on me that life just loves paradoxes.

user_31;user_31100.jpg;There is stillness and ease to be found in every moment. Especially during the mundane daily chores like folding the laundry and washing the dishes. I usually zone out when doing these things and mentally go to things that are ‘more important’ or more entertaining. But i have (re-)started the habit of being as present and mindful as possible during those moments. And how blissful it is! It creates little pockets of time during my day where I can come back to reality (instead of getting stuck in my thoughts or imagination - and there is quite a bit of overlap between them 😉). It allows me a few moments to check in with myself and step out of the river of automation and habit. And it also gives me the opportunity to redirect the course of the day, stepping out of habitual thoughts and into better ones. 🌟 . . . #mindfulliving #mindfulness #mindfullife #mindfulmoments #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #yogateacher #vegansofig #vegangirl #lawofattraction #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse

user_31;user_31102.jpg;As promised in my last post here is where i envision our future foundation tiny house to be: on a plot of land somewhere in the south of europe (maybe Portugal?). The property has some old fruit trees on it and is big enough for our tiny house, a fruit tree forrest and an organic veggie garden. It is only five minutes away from the ocean, 15 minutes from the nearest town and is close to a few trails in case we want to go for walks/hikes. The nearest town has a big grocery store and at least one vegan café (for date nights 😋). Our neighbours live a few minutes walking away (so we still have a sense of community but also privacy) and quickly become good friends of ours. Once our kids have grown to an age where they want to have their own rooms, we can easily build an extension to our tiny house for two separate bedrooms. Our tiny house will also have an outdoor shower with a beautiful view of the area. Oh and we also live under one hour away from an international airport so that family can easily come to visit us. All in all, the tiny house will give us the peace and quiet for slow living while still having all the modern amenities to live comfortably. And it will be fully off grid ✌🏼 Do you have any dreams that you are trying to manifest?

user_31;user_31103.jpg;The last few days i have been dreaming and visualising what i would like our tiny house to look like. It’s something that we can’t afford yet at this moment but the thought of one day being able to build one that fits our lives perfectly makes me so excited. I have already been searching the web for plots of land for sale in the South of Europe (warm climate hello 👋🏻) and made a floor plan of the tiny house. At first i had trouble visualising our tiny house because it was still so abstract and seemed a far-off goal that would take us years to reach. But after these days of dreaming and play pretend planning, i can feel my mind starting to see it more and more as something completely attainable. Maybe in a next post i can share where i see us building the tiny house and what it would feel/look like. How magical would it be if a few years from now (or maybe less, who knows what life had in store for us!) i look back on that post and that has become our reality 🤩 Do you have dreams that seem big and out of reach? How do you make them feel more attainable and real? . . . #tinyhouse #tinyhousedreams #offgridliving #lawofattraction #manifestationmagic #thankyouuniverse
user_31;user_31104.jpg;AD // I love how it’s becoming easier and easier to buy sustainable and ethical as more brands get onboard in trying to preserve our precious mama earth 🌍 Today I received the beautiful Pink Gift Box from @thehumble.co They quite literally have everything you need to keep your teeth healthy and happy while keeping plastic out of the mix. All their packaging is recyclable and most of their products are made from sustainably sourced bamboo or other biodegradable materials like corn starch. The few items that do have plastic (like their toothpaste tube) are recyclable. Switching out your dental products to a more eco-friendly version is the quickest and easiest step to start reducing your waste.

user_31;user_31110.jpg;"“There are three ways in which the ego will treat the present moment: as a means to an end, as an obstacle, or as an enemy. (...) A vital question to ask yourself frequently is: What is my relationship to the present moment? Am I treating the Now as no more than a means to an end (busy trying to get elsewhere)? Do I see it as an obstacle (a problem to be solved)? Am i making it into an enemy (complaining about/hating the present and arguing with what is)? Since the present moment is all you ever have, since Life is inseparable from the Now, what the question really means is: what is your relationship with the Now? (...) Once you have decided you want the present moment to be your friend, it is up to you to make the first move: become friendly towards it, welcome it no matter in what disguise it comes, and soon you will see results. Life becomes friendly towards you; people become helpful, circumstances cooperative. One decision changes your entire reality. But that one decision you have to make again and again and again - until it becomes natural to live in such a way. “ - A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle . . . . #anewearth #eckharttolle #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #yogateacher #vegansofig #vegangirl #lawofattraction #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse"
user_31;user_31111.jpg;Ok this is going to sound odd, but i made up this weird mantra that has the power to ease away my ego and fear based patterns instantly. Here it is: ‘I have no enemies.’ Whenever i hear someone say something i don’t agree with and feel that urge to immediately respond back, i tell myself ‘i have no enemies’ and with it i can feel my whole body soften. A lot of times the urge to respond or defend my opinion will completely ease away. When i am out on the street and i can feel anxiety flood my body because there are too many people around, i repeat to myself ‘i have no enemies’. And with it, the tension drops and it feels like i am floating through the mass of people instead of putting up an energetic boundary in an attempt to ‘protect myself’. It feels like this odd little mantra lifts away all resistance to life. It reminds me of the fact that everyone around me is me, and i am them. We are all a small facet of source and from the moment I started seeing everyone as a part of me, the resistance dropped. I no longer felt the need to convince people of my point of view or to ‘protect myself’ from other people’s energy when being out.

user_31;user_31113.jpg;Do not chase a life that isn’t yours. Magic happens when we step into the spirit of allowing our path to unfold, rather than forcing things to happen. Comparing our journey or competing to model a life that someone else is living is a tragedy. When we do this, we abandon our own karmic destiny. Instead, we must listen to those quiet whispers, the intuitive nudges and signs that pull us, lead us, and usher us into the very place we are meant to be for our soul to grow. - @risingwoman . . This quote resonates so deeply with me 💕 Now that i am taking a break from work I feel like i am finally starting to get more clarity on things. It feels like the dust is settling and the path is finally becoming clear again. Taking a break and taking a step back, made me realise how much I was trying to push things forward, trying to figure out all the hows and chasing things that didn’t feel right, instead of just following what feels good and natural to me. I wasn’t 100% sure yet that i could trust my intuition and that there would be enough abundance around for me to be me, if that makes any sense. I thought i had to fit in to get anywhere in life. I thought i had to please as many people as possible. I no longer subscribe to the model that ‘this works for everyone’, whether it comes to career, relationships, health, happiness. It feels like i am finally pulling my awareness back inside of myself to ask myself these questions instead of relying on others to guide me the way. And I am now fully starting to understand that I can trust my gut on *anything*🌻 sometimes lessons need to circle around a few times before they truly start to make sense 🌞 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #yogateacher #vegansofig #vegangirl #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse #shadowwork

user_31;user_31115.jpg;How to stop worrying: 1. realise that there are infinite ways that something can play out, 2. going over the worst case scenarios isn’t going to prevent them from happening or lessen their impact 3. in the moment of worry you have a choice: focus on what could possibly go wrong (and live in fear) or focus on which outcome you desire and finding solutions to get there  I used to and sometimes still am a big worrier. I think most of it stems from a belief that i have no control over my reality. Things ‘happen to me’. But i have come to realise that that mindset has brought me nothing but anxiety and fear. It has kept me small - or i should say I have kept myself small - in an attempt to protect myself from the imagined worst case scenario. All the while forgetting that i have the power to focus on what i do desire and allow that to lead me instead. You always have a choice and your focus will always influence the outcome.

user_31;user_31116.jpg;Today is my 27th revolution around the sun ☀️ And all i want to say is thank you to the past versions of myself for having the courage to follow my heart. If i had not made the wild decision to go to India for a Yoga teacher training (even though i had just finished my Master’s degree in criminology), my life wouldn’t have been what it is now. I vividly remember my last day at the internship with the federal police (which was part of my course) and hearing my heart whisper to me that it felt trapped. Even though becoming a policer officer had been a dream of mine, something about it felt deeply off. It felt like i had out-grown that dream and now for the first time was left not having any direction on what to do in life. I had been doing yoga for a few years and while I was at a class a couple of weeks later I could hear my heart saying to me: ‘I like this. Maybe you should ask your teacher where she did her training’. The thought of becoming a teacher had never crossed my mind up to that point. Actually, i flew to India not even sure if i wanted to teach but just trusting that there was something there waiting for me. Making big decisions in life based not on logic but heart are so freaking scary. But looking back, they have been some of the best and most transformational decisions. This world worships logic. And even though logic has a place when it comes to problem solving, when it comes to questions on life direction and ‘where to?’, I always consult my heart first. And she has never failed me 💕 . . . . . #thankyouuniverse #sacredfeminine #sacredfeminineenergy #heartwisdom 💕🌸🌈✨

To all the people with periods out there: let’s start with our moon flow. Our periods are what connects us to the cycles of nature. Let’s not put plastic in our panties or our yonis (yes most pads and tampons have plastic in them). There are beautiful alternatives out there that are safe for our bodies and the earth. My favourite alternative are the vegan period proof panties by @modibodi. If you have watched my ‘zero waste period’ video, you’ll know that i bought my first pair a while back and it’s been my favourite thing to wear during my moon flow.

user_31;user_31120.jpg;we are taught to compromise ourselves for the sakes of not upsetting others. this is self-abandonment. as social creatures fitting in has always been important. being accepted by the people around you equaled survival. you needed your parent’s approval to feel safe and loved, and so you adapted. you needed your friend’s approval so you changed. and with it you pushed away the authentic parts of you that didn’t fit the idea of what other people had of you. i am slowly un-covering these parts of myself. i am slowly re-discovering the power of my own voice and remembering how good it feels to word exactly what i feel. i am starting to see that it is totally safe to ask for my needs to be met. and that i can leave any situation, friendship or dynamic that doesn’t feel right. i am no longer grasping for the answers outside of myself. i have always had this massive fear of making the wrong decision. but i can see now that there is no shame in taking a ‘wrong’ turn. and that life is just one big sandbox of experimentation. so in reality, there is no such thing as a ‘wrong’ turn. . . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub

user_31;user_31122.jpg;gifted // Reducing your environmental impact can be so overwhelming at times because there are so many facets to it: food, clothing, plastic pollution, gas emissions, ... But i read a quote recently that really resonated with me. I don’t remember the exact words but it went along the lines of: we don’t need everyone to be perfect at #zerowaste, we need millions of people to be imperfect at it and simply trying their best. We all live different lives and come from different backgrounds. All we can do is simply give it our best shot because each small change adds to the whole. One of these small changes is reducing the amount of clothes we buy and either buying second hand or from slow fashion brands that produce their clothing ethically. This is why I was excited when @organicbasics reached out and decided to send me some of their products. They are a slow fashion brand working with european factories (say hello fair wages and working conditions 🙏🏼) to produce everyday basic staples, like underwear, T-shirts and active wear. The T-shirt i am wearing is so extremely soft and well-made. I wore it for five days straight but decided that maybe it was time to wash it 😅 Can anyone relate? They also gave me a discount code to share with you all: SILKEOBC2 which gives you 10GBP/15EUR off or free US shipping if you live in the states. . . . . #organicbasics #slowfashion #ethicalfashion #sustainablefashion #fashionrevolution #lowwaste #lowimpactmovement

I even decided half-way through to delete all the social media apps off my phone so that i am no longer tempted to check in with everyone’s lives right as I wake up. It’s been so nice to wake up not knowing what has happened in the world yet. Just slowly going about my morning until I feel ready to connect in. I have noticed that during the mornings i am always a bit more sensitive to stimuli and having a quiet and uneventful morning feels so damn good 🙌🏼 I am still not where i want to be with my health but i really miss having a creative outlet and a place to share. So ... i am back 💕 I am still not sure when i’ll start making youtube videos again (those take a lot more energy than a picture and i would prefer to reserve that energy for healing ⚡️).

user_31;user_31126.jpg;I used to make up fantasies in my head of a darling little princess and her loving gentle mother. The queen would braid her sweet child’s hair at night and sing her to sleep with her honey melting lullabies. She would teach her about how to be graceful yet strong in the face of adversity. And how to let no one’s words touch her silken skin. She would teach her how to find balance in the ever-changing natural world. And how to distinguish friend from foe. I would dream about the endless journeys and laughter shared between the queen and her daughter. And how easily their love for one another spilled from their words. I still carry these dreams with me but i have come to see it’s time to bury them far beneath. So that i can finally allow myself to mourn the queen that never was. And accept the queen that is. . . . 📷 by @daria_szotek . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse #eaglepose #yogadaily #yogadailypractice
user_31;user_31127.jpg;I was talking to my boyfriend last night about the realisation that i was low key depressed over the last few months. Not full on, ‘i never want to get out of my bed again’ depressed. But just feeling below average. Just going through the motions and not feeling particularly excited about life. Last week everything shifted for me big time and i feel like i have been brought back to life! Life doesn’t feel so heavy anymore. Maybe it’s the seasons changing, my health improving or me facing my fears head on. I am not sure. Maybe all of the above. But whatever it was, I feel like the five year-old in me woke up from her deep nap and she’s ready to start partying again. 💕 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse

user_31;user_31130.jpg;This morning i woke up feeling lighter than when i went to sleep. To say that the last few days were emotional is an understatement. I am not sure what brought it on, whether it’s the healing occurring in my body or the new moon is pisces, but it was deep and intense. The last week has been centred around releasing shame and fear. It started with talking openly about my views on the divisiveness happening in our society. I have always been afraid of being misinterpreted or misunderstood but I decided that the only way to face a fear is to step into the fire. And then yesterday I could feel that it was finally time to drop the heavy backpack I have been carrying my whole life and open up a conversation with my parents about the ways i felt unseen or unheard as a child. Not with the intention to point fingers but simply to share. I have been carrying these words with me for so long. Wanting to tell them the ways in which their decisions influenced my life but i never felt like it was my place to tell them. I would dream of the perfect moment to open this discussion and it dawned on me that there is never a perfect timing. And that if i feel the need to share, to be able to put things behind me, i shouldn’t wait. And so i shared everything that was on my heart, the good and the bad. I felt a huge wave of release. Now they know how i feel, it’s out. And i no longer have to fear their reaction to it. If there is anything you take away from this caption, let it be this: air out the things you feel shameful about. Own your feelings and opinions. Once the world sees is all, the opinion of others will no longer have a grip over you. And you’ll be free. . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse #newmooninpisces
user_31;user_31131.jpg;I attended Christabel’s @breath.of.bliss online Workshop last week and waaooowww 🤩 It reminded me of the breath session I did during my ayahuasca weekend a year back. It still baffles my mind how transformative your breath can be. After the workshop was over my body felt so soft and open. It really made me realise how much tension i was holding onto. Not only that but i have been feeling more comfortable with myself, re-connected to my child-like curious self. Saturday we went to the beach and I felt this overwhelming surge of excitement. I don’t think i have ever felt this excitement since i was a kid 😅 (swipe left to see). I find it sad how we are taught as adults to restrain our emotions especially in public places. Anyways I enjoyed being a kid again, filled with excitement over a beautiful sunset and an empty beach 😄 There is not really a point to this caption except for maybe setting yourself free from time to time 😉 and not worrying too much about how others will perceive you. ❤️ Also thank you @laylaalunalove for bringing Christabel’s work into my awareness 😍 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #connectedbreathing #consciousbreathing
user_31;user_31132.jpg;playing around like a lil 🐒 on the mat today 🌻 If you want to learn my tricks on how to get upside down effortlessly in headstand then take a look at the link in my bio. I created this 4-week course last year as I remembered that at the beginning of my yoga journey I used to look at other yogis do headstand and would doubt if I would ever be able to do it. At the time my legs felt sooo heavy, I couldn’t imagine them ever lifting off the floor. Until I learned a few tricks and started applying basic physics to my own yoga practice. Now headstand is second nature to me, I could do it with my eyes closed and still feel very stable. If you are wanting to work on your headstand but don’t know where to start, then this course will teach you all you need to know to make your headstand feel effortless ❤️ . . . . #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #brightonyogateacher #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogalife #freeyoga #freeyogaclass #headstandpractice
user_31;user_31133.jpg;If you treat every difficult situation, person and emotion as an opportunity for expansion, you’ll find that life only puts things in your way that invite you to meet your shadow. It shows you the parts of yourself you have repressed and shamed. Life gives you an opportunity to reconnect those parts of yourself so that you may step in your true authenticity. For me the theme of the last few months have been play, and learning to not taking everything so seriously. I have been exploring parts of life that i rejected. Last week my boyfriend introduced me to this game called Stardew Valley. I have never been into games, i saw them as a waste of time. Why would i want to spend time online when i could use that times to create something in real life. I felt like every second of my day had to be spent in productivity. And if i wasn’t creating something, at least i could watch videos and documentaries that would expand my mind. Everything needed to be purposeful and contribute to my future. So I played the game and got hooked 😂 I played it for four days straight before i felt the calling to start doing other activities again. The first two days i felt so ashamed of myself. How could i justify spending all this time playing an online game that wasn’t useful to me in real life? I was now actively participating in something I had always rejected for myself. It didn’t even fit the way i saw myself. I am not a gaming person. It was really my boyfriend that opened my eyes to the fact that not everything has to be so serious and not everything needs to be productive. It’s okay to have fun for the sake of having fun. Hearing him say that made me realise how serious i take this life. And how much of my time i spend in this constrictive box i have set up for myself called: my identity haha. Anyways, long story short. Every situation that elicits shame in you, is a moment to expand and to see what aspect of yourself you have pushed down. Who else has had an instance where you really really reject something for yourself and then you end up trying it out and totally understanding why other people like it so much? 😄 . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerwork #selfloveclub

user_31;user_31135.jpg;🌹GIRL TALK🌹  Today is the last day of my period and I am almost sad about it. I have noticed that during those 5 days of my moon cycle, I can connect so much deeper to myself and my creativity. I have been doing guided meditations every evening and the depths in which i can sink into myself are completely new territory. Now that today is the last day, i can feel that connection slowly lessening. I feel myself shifting into a more earthy, grounded phase again. I notice myself focussing more on practical details, goals, deadlines, to do list. I find it so fascinating to see my energy shift back and forth during my cycle. Has anyone else noticed these shifts in energy depending on what phase of your moon cycle you’re in? . . . . #mooncycle #girltalk #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #periodtalk

user_31;user_31140.jpg;It took a lot of courage to upload yesterday’s youtube video on my message to the vegan community. It took a lot of courage because I usually stay away from sharing my opinion when i know a large group of people may disagree with it. But the past year and all of its experiences has brought me to understand that i can trust myself and that it is safe to speak my mind. I used to have a bad habit of attracting people to me that made me feel small and dumb. That made me feel like i had nothing to bring to the conversation. Last year has been all about breaking down those beliefs and allowing myself to stand in my own power. I guess my perfectionism also wasn’t helping because it held me back from speaking up unless i felt like i had it 100% figured out. Now i realise that everyone can bring something useful to the table and through open discussion we allow ourselves to grow and our minds to expand. Also what a coincidence that this surge of courage came right at the time of a full lunar eclipse ... or is it? 🌔 . . . 📸 by my beautiful friend @daria_szotek . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #thankyouuniverse #veganforlife

user_31;user_31143.jpg;Today marks my 6th year as a vegan 🙉 I have always made decisions quite intuitively and switching to a vegan lifestyle is by far my best intuitive decision to date. I hadn’t seen any of the documentaries and there wasn’t much of a vegan community on youtube yet. But i just remembered having this deeper part of myself nudging me away from meat and dairy. My body was clearly communicating with me that it didn’t digest those foods well, so I listened. Only a few months after did i start researching into the benefits health-wise and the ethical/ecological side of it. Reading and watching those things is what really sealed the deal for me and made me realise there was no way I was ever going to go back to eating meat. ❤️ If you are still on the fence about switching to a more plantbased lifestyle i highly recommend watching the documentary Earthlings. This is the first one i had ever watched and it really broke open my heart and made me realise what a cruel industry the meat/dairy industry is. I would also recommend watching the Best Speech Ever on youtube and the documentary Cowspiracy 🙏🏼 . . . . . #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganforlife #veganfit #veganfoodshare #hclf #wslf #rawtillwhenever #cowspiracy #forksoverknives #veganlean #veganfoodinspo #veganrecipe #veganfoodideas #cleanse #cleaneating #cleaneatingideas #foodinspo #breakfastinspo #highcarbvegan #healthybreakfastideas

user_31;user_31145.jpg;Everyone you meet is a mirror giving you a closer look into yourself. Notice who you are most drawn to in life. Who do you look up to or admire? All you are looking at are attributes you are wanting to cultivate within yourself. Notice who you dislike or who annoys you deeply. All you are looking at this time are attributes within yourself you have rejected. Interacting with other people and staying constantly aware of what emotions come to the surface is the quickest way to meet your shadow and higher self. 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌗 #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #shadowwork

user_31;user_31147.jpg;I realised i have been frantically running away from the question that scares me most. What is the point of my life? Why am I here and what am i supposed to do with all this time i have been given? Society around me seems to be running around in a hurry to get somewhere. But where are we running towards? And why? And why do we glorify being busy all the time. As if our self-worth is tied to our productivity the way a machine’s value is based on how efficiently it works to produce a product. A human is not a machine so why do we try to live like one. And if our purpose and worth is not tied to producing than what is?  I felt a wave of anxiety flow over me trying to figure out what i want to get out of this life. So i decided to flip it backwards and pretend it’s my last day on earth. What things would be important to me on that day? What things would i look back onto with fondness and joy? What would my priorities in life be?  Here’s what came up: 1. Spending time connecting with others and having many joyful memories spent with others. It is in our connection with others that we grow and really start to understand the inter-connectedness of life. 2. Spending time in nature amongst the miracles of this earth. Contemplating the beauty of this spinning globe. Connecting with nature through travel, gardening and ocean swims. After all as far as i know we are only here for one lifetime, wouldn’t you want to experience all the beauty this earth has to offer before passing over? 3. Making a positive impact on the people around me. By diving deep into myself and figuring myself out I hope to inspire similar transformation in others. And in this sense contributing to the wellbeing of this generation and the ones to follow. Once i realised what i wanted to focus on in life and what deeply felt like a priority to me, i could feel a sense of lightness. We don’t have to move entire mountains for our lives to be meaningful.

user_31;user_31152.jpg;There is abundance all around you. The question is whether you are willing to see it.  What do you tend to focus on? What are your thoughts when you see someone successful? What’s your reaction when a bill comes in the mail?  If your answers are: everything that goes wrong in life, envy/hate and lastly feeling resentment or frustration, then that’s what you’ll create more of. Here’s why we get stuck in negativity: our mind loves to solve puzzles. So when we find ourselves in a situation where we lack any kind of abundance (financial, health, social, ...) our mind will focus on the problem thinking it will find a solution there. It’s good to reflect on your situations but the mind kinda goes cray cray when we don’t give it any new information to aid in the solution finding process, so it’ll stay stuck going over and over the same things in the hopes of finding what it’s looking for. And now we are stuck in a never ending loop of negativity and worrying. So if you want to unblock yourself and move forward, give it new information. Find people who have already accomplished what you desire and use them as inspiration, as an example that it is possible to create what you want. When you get a bill in the mail, focus on the fact that you have the money to pay for it, even if it temporarily brings your balance down. Also see if you can dive deeper in your unconscious beliefs surrounding the abundance that is currently blocked. Find out what part of you feels safe by having limited access to abundance. And then work on reintegrating that part of you so that it feels safe no matter what your extrrnal abundance is🦋 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #abundancemindset #abundancenow #lawofattraction

user_31;user_31154.jpg;I remember in the midst of my binge eating disorder (years ago) I would look up videos on how to overcome it. People told me, just go for a walk when you feel like binging or call a friend ... sometimes i wonder if the people giving that advice have ever really experienced binging because i can tell you no walk is going to distract my mind from the thought of stuffing my face. 🙄 I have been binge free for - i don’t even know how long anymore because i stopped counting the days, months and years. Going for a walk never helped me overcome it. And that is because binging is not the issue, it’s a symptom. It is a symptom of something deeper going on that makes you feel trapped or stuck. And when your mind cannot resolve that tension by fixing the situation, it will find something else to at least soothe you. Binging is a coping strategy not an illness. The best way to heal from binging is to take your attention away from the binging (meaning: don’t try to stop binging) and work on finding out what is happening subconsciously. Work on resolving that underlying tension in your mind and the binging will fade away by itself, because your mind will no longer need a coping strategy to push away the pain. I have so much more i want to share on this and will make an updated youtube video ❤️ . . . . #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganforlife #veganfit #veganfoodshare #hclf #wslf #rawtillwhenever #cowspiracy #forksoverknives #veganlean #veganfoodinspo #veganrecipe #veganfoodideas #cleanse #cleaneating #cleaneatingideas #foodinspo #breakfastinspo #highcarbvegan #healthybreakfastideas #bingeeatingrecovery
user_31;user_31155.jpg;"It’s okay to hurt.  Yesterday I was diving deeper in the aspect of myself that feels resistant to people seeing me, and part of it is the fear of receiving negative comments. I am okay with feedback that is coming from a place of love but I have a deeper resistance to receiving unfounded criticism, or comments with the single aim to hurt. This hasn’t really happened yet but I have seen other people on the internet being brutal to others for no apparent reason. Of course most of this fear can be tied back to my childhood and using perfectionism to keep myself safe from judgement. But there is another layer to it: I have this idea built up in my head that I should get to a point where negativity doesn’t phase me anymore. Or I have to always be on my game and see the ‘bigger picture’: that people who spill hurt, are hurting themselves. And you simply triggered something in them. But I just realised that this idea in itself is resistance; because I made myself believe that a spiritually developed person should no longer be affected by the words of others. Within this idea is a resistance to feeling pain. So you know what, it’s okay. It’s okay to feel hurt when someone says something mean. I give my future self permission to feel it all, and I won’t judge myself for feeling a certain way. It’s okay to hurt. God that feels so good to say. Because now I feel like I have lifted this big expectation on myself of ‘spiritual perfection’. And once I know that have moved through the pain, the ‘big picture’ will come through naturally and I won’t be using it as a way of by-passing my own emotions. . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub"

I have this tug of war going on between the part of me that deeply wants to be seen and taken care of. And another part that absolutely fears it. I have uncovered childhood memories in the last few weeks of situations where i felt so unsafe to be seen. To be seen meant to be vulnerable for verbal tear-down and possibly my needs not being met. I also remember being 2 or 3 years old and being completely ignored while i was calling out to a loved one for attention. Even though it’s such a small thing, it made me feel so insignificant and unseen. It was one of the first times i remember someone intentionally ignoring me. And so my whole life i have focussed so much on independence and not being reliant on others for my needs to shield myself from this pain ever occurring again. What i didn’t realise was that as i shielded myself and tried being completely self-reliant, i was pushing myself even further away from being able to connect with others. And at the deepest core that is exactly what i wanted: to be seen for who i am, to be accepted, to be heard and to be met in my needs. . . ... to continue reading head over to my blog silkedewulf.com/blog (the caption was too long for instagram 😘) . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub

user_31;user_31162.jpg;🌸 CALLING ALL WOMEN 🌸  I have been reading up more on releasing sexual trauma because the last few years i have been experiencing pussy pain aka vulvodynia. For a long time i didn’t feel like opening up about this on my social media because it is something so personal. But i have this deep yearning to erase all shame about it within myself. Our sexuality is such a natural part of life, just like eating or drinking is. How is it that i am able to easily talk about anxiety or eating disorders but choke up when it comes to sexuality. Anyways, i have been looking into Yoni de-armouring and other methods to release this physically and emotionally build up pain. For anyone going through the same thing, know that you are not alone. I have been following @grace___hazel for a while and been diving into her juicy podcast. I would highly recommend her ❤️ . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #yonidearmouring
user_31;user_31163.jpg;I have to be honest. I have been less inspired to post photos on here. Part of it because i spend my days working on my online business or editing videos (which i absolutely love!) and the other part is that the sun goes down around 4:30pm here 🙉 which doesn’t leave me much time to take pictures and work at the same time. I also feel pressure to always write down my deepest thoughts. Sometimes i simply haven’t had any deep thoughts in a few days because i have been pre-occupied with other things. And i know none of you expect me to whip out life wisdom in each post but for some reason I have put that expectation on myself. I also still haven’t figured out the balance between my yoga posts and other posts (like this one). And then also, my mind has had a lot of resistance to taking pictures of myself because part of me sees it as shallow or vain. But then another part craves the creative expression of it. Definitely something I should dive deeper into and see why i feel that way about it. I guess you could say i have been feeling a bit lost the last few days as to what to focus on, what to share and create for you guys. Yeah, just wanted to share this because even when it looks like someone has got their life figured out, that doesn’t mean they have 😅 Anyways, hope you are having a great monday! I need a nap and a map to live. That would be great (hoping the universe will hear my request 😂). . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub
user_31;user_31164.jpg;Life is kind of like playing a game of hide and seek  We hide parts of ourselves that were frowned upon when we were younger  And then we grow up, trying to seek those parts in other people  Forgetting that those parts are within us  Still waiting to be found and released from their hiding spot . 👁 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub
user_31;user_31165.jpg;~•~ Lazy mornings ~•~ . . After watching @tealswanofficial ‘s videos for years I finally decided to pick up one of her books. If you were part of the 7-day Self-Love Challenge you will already know that i love her methods and they have worked so well in reconnecting the different aspects of myself to feel whole again. If you missed the challenge or feel stuck in life, i highly recommend her videos and especially this book i am reading, called the Completion Process. It gave me such a deeper understanding of what ‘negative’ emotions and triggers really mean and what their function are. Even if you don’t feel stuck in life but are in a relationship or are a parent, this book could really help you understand the people around you a lot better and why sometimes people ‘overreact’ to certain triggers. ❤️ . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub
user_31;user_31166.jpg;Quick tip: if you are starting to feel your concentration dropping or feel foggy, get upside down! By getting upside down you are encouraging better circulation, especially in your brain. This will give your brain a fresh load of oxygen and help you feel more mentally ‘fresh’ as well. If you can’t do headstand, even just a simple forward fold or downward dog will do the trick 🌻 .

user_31;user_31167.jpg;Sometimes walls need to come crashing down, because you realised half-way through, the only thing it has done is kept the darkness in Sometimes life needs to knock you off your high ladder, and have you face down, one with the earth, to give you the right perspective. So that you may look up and see you have been climbing the wrong tree. And sometimes a raging forest fire is needed.

user_31;user_31169.jpg;I have been feeling so much better these last days. I can’t tell if it’s the energy of the full moon a few nights back or my body finally releasing some overdue tension. I have the tendency to contract in times of stress. I either will clench my jaw so hard that it hurts or I'll feel a dull ache in my right psoas (so specific right 😂) I feel so lucky to always have my yoga practice to turn to when i notice these patterns coming up. I can feel that through the growing awareness of my tension habits i have become much better at staying open and soft. And in this softness i reconnected with passions I used to have a kid but died out when I 'grew up'. My body is begging to be danced and i have been searching the internet to find a vocal coach near me. It feels weird picking up these old flames again but gosh does it feel good to move energy either through my body or voice! It amazes me that after years of having a yoga practice it still keeps pulling me deeper and deeper into self-awareness.

user_31;user_31171.jpg;🍃 DE-CONNECT 🍃  It’s part of my daily routine now to not connect with the rest of the world until lunch. That’s when i’ll open my mailbox, my social media apps and re-connect with the wider world around me. There is something so nurturing about being by myself in the morning. Since i am self-employed I get to decide what i work on but sometimes business emails or sticking around on IG for too long will get me out of my flow and interfere with my planning for the day. I end up procrastinating. So i have decided to start the day with things that i see as a priority that day. This will include: . . - either some meditation or gentle yoga to wake me up. The heart opener I am showing here is my absolute favourite to wake up my spine and get any kinks out. My @myga_yoga yoga wheel has been a steady partner in my yoga practice as it helps me to gently open up in the morning. . . - journalling, . . - doing the most important business task (whether editing a video or preparing a yoga class) . . - and having a nutritious breakfast. . .  These are my non-negotiables. Once i have finished those, i open up to the world and respond to what is asked from me. This is also why i have changed to posting my iG posts at lunch instead of the early morning. . . .

user_31;user_31172.jpg;~// CAN WE BE DEFINED AS COMPLEX BEINGS //~ . . .  Has anyone looked into human design? I just recently got introduced to the concept and find it fascinating. I have been watching all the videos @daramuse made with @jennazoedaily . I am not sure yet if i totally buy into it but i am open to what there is to learn from it. So far a lot of it resonates and i can see myself in the energy design that corresponds to me. I love that it basically gives you permission to be who you are naturally. It strips away this idea that there is only one way of going about life or to be successful at anything really. Has anyone else looked into this? What are your thoughts? . . . PS: apparently i am a projector with splenic authority. Which actually does correspond to how i usually go about things. 👽 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #humandesign
user_31;user_31173.jpg;I am learning to trust myself again. To trust my intuition even when it makes no logical sense. To trust my body even when my mind wants something else. I am learning to trust the way i work naturally and effortlessly instead of looking around me and trying to copy they way others are taking action. My whole life I have been most successful when I simply turn in and do the inner work. Life has a way of putting the right people at the right time on my path. I guess my soul has a preference of operating through ‘attraction’ rather than ‘pursuit’. And for a while i felt uncomfortable with it. I see all these people around me hustling and pursuing their dreams, and so i thought to myself i must stride forward too and push ahead as well. But slowly i am getting reminded that maybe it’s not a ‘one size fits all’ approach to success. Sure you need passion, determination and patience. But i noticed that by stepping out of the way and allowing things to flow the way they want to, i feel happier and things align so much faster for me. ❤️🌹 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub
user_31;user_31174.jpg;In a world that glorifies grinding and pushing, i chose to remain soft and open. Always listening to what feels right in the moment and trusting that force is not the only way to reach your dreams. 💛 Instead of chasing outside events, i chase inner transformation.

user_31;user_31175.jpg;The last few weeks i have made the conscious decision to not open my social media apps before lunch. Some days have been easier than others to resist the urge but I have seen such a big improvement in my day to day anxiety. I feel so much more focussed and grounded in the mornings because i no longer get pulled into all directions. I start my day with what i think is important or a priority and only once i have finished that, i will open my phone. . . If you are dealing with anxiety or stress in general definitely give this a try. I know it can be hard. The only thing able to wake me up in the morning was the rush of checking my social media apps. Now my mornings are slow and i feel much more present and grounded. ❤️ . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #selfloveclub #anxietyrelief

user_31;user_31177.jpg;"🌸 Creativity Rituals 🌸  On days that I feel un-inspired or un-motivated, I have a few rituals to help move through the internal blocks. I find myself in these funks whenever I feel like I have done too many outward activities and not enough inward ones. We can only pour out what we already have within, right? These rituals are activities that fill up my cup of inspiration and motivation. . . . 🌻Meditation: nothing soothes my soul more than finding my centre again and becoming aware of the present moment. You don’t have to sit down cross-legged to be able to meditate. You could be cooking, driving, walking, painting, … The idea is to simply slow down and become aware of your existence. Like a child, I love to cultivate curiosity for the things around me; sounds, smells, touch, sight, tastes,… . 🌻Yoga: As the mind needs stillness, the body needs movement. Moving my body, whether it’s a gentle practice or a challenging one, always leaves me in a better mood. . 🌻Napping: … and sometimes the body needs stillness too haha!

user_31;user_31180.jpg;After a few weeks of taking a break from my home yoga practice (replacing it with copious naps 🌜and only gentle stretches), it feels good to dive back into the poses i was previously working on. . A little tip if you are working on your spilts as well: it helps for me to imagine my muscles softening and releasing tension rather than forcing myself into a stretch. This technique takes a bit longer but gives your muscles the time to ease into the pose and signals them that it is safe to release. 🌟 . Also know that you can use props to assist you! I love using my @myga_yoga block to support my front hip so that i don’t have to worry about over-stretching, and i can just relax into the pose. 🌻 . Block: @myga_yoga Mat: cork mat from @myga_yoga .

user_31;user_31182.jpg;If you watched my live Q&A a little while back you’ll already know that I have been going through a period of feeling less confident than i used to. . . I have had little melt downs over the last few months because things that didn’t use to faze me all of a sudden got to me so easily. I think self-love is an ever evolving journey and even the most confident people have moments of doubt. There will always be new situations that challenge your current perception of yourself and it is by working through them that we grow our confidence even stronger. . . I have been thinking about doing another self-love challenge like i did a year back. This time I am thinking of hosting the challenge either through e-mail (sending you a daily reminder for the duration of the challenge) or creating a private page on my website where we can come together. It will be free and open for anyone to join.

user_31;user_31183.jpg;🌹Let’s talk progress 🌸  I see a lot of these progress pictures floating around Instagram of people nailing incredible poses. And even though these posts are super inspirational, I think sometimes we forget the road that people had to take to get there. I sometimes catch myself thinking, why i am not there yet? I start doubting my practice and my body. But here’s the truth, the road is different for everyone. Some people just naturally progress fast and others need some extra time. For me, i am the last one of those two 😉 Even for those who progress quickly it’s usually not a linear process. Somedays you just smash it out of the park and the next day when trying again it seems like you are back to where you were two weeks ago. This is my current Dancer’s Pose. I have been ‘stuck’ at this point for a while now because my psoas loves holding onto stress which makes this pose harder to reach for me. But at the end of the day i just remind myself that it doesn’t matter what the pose looks like. As long as I feel good while in the pose and practice patience ❤️ Here i am using the @myga_yoga strap to help me bridge the gap between my hand and my toes. If there is one prop i would suggest getting, it would be a strap. It helps you prep for those harder poses while still keeping tip top alignment 🙏🏼 (Also using their cork mat which is super light weight and easy to travel with in my opinion). . . . What pose are you ‘stuck’ in at the moment? Also feel free to DM me with questions or pictures of yourself doing the yoga poses. I would love to help wherever I can 😘 . . . . #ad #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #brightonyogateacher #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #mygayoga #bestyogamat #sustainableyoga #sustainableyogamat

Today i am able to squeeze 5-6 days between washes. But it is my goal to stretch it to at least a week 🙌🏼 . . . Would any of you be interested in a video on how i am able to train my hair to go longer between washes? 🌸🌹 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork #nopoo #nopoomethod #lowpoomethod #naturalhaircare
user_31;user_31187.jpg;Did you know that cork is one if the most environment friendly materials? . . For those of you who don’t already know, cork is harvested from the bark of the cork oak tree. Because the bark regrows in a cycle of approx. 14 years, farmers actually do not cut down the tree but will work with trees in cycles to allow the bark to re-grow before harvesting again. Also since the demand of cork is growing, more bark oak trees are being planted to meet that demand. And more trees = cleaner air and a healthier planet. On top of that, cork is very durable and naturally anti-microbial, which actually makes it perfect to make yoga mats out. Especially on those hot (sweaty) summer days. Oh summer where have you gone 🙉 . . Here i am using the beautiful @myga_yoga cork yoga mat which is amongst one of my favourite mats they make. If you or a friend are in need of a new yoga mat, definitely check out their products. And use the code ‘Silke10’ for a 10% discount ❤️🌹 . . . #ad #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #brightonyogateacher #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #mygayoga #bestyogamat #sustainableyoga #sustainableyogamat
user_31;user_31188.jpg;Trying to give my sis directions while also trying to not get blinded by the sun 🌞 . . .  I am completely falling in love again with putting some more thought into what i wear, how i style my hair, maybe a lil make-up here and there. I don’t know when it exactly really sunk in but it’s pretty great to be human. And before we know it this lifetime will be over and we’ll return back to wherever we came from. So why not enjoy the earthly pleasures with awareness? I was in a crystal shop the other day and damn did you ever hear what lovely sounds crystals can make? I kept running my fingers through the different boxes of crystal totally absorbed into how they felt beneath my fingers and the beautiful sounds they made. A few minutes later we walked into a vintage store and i couldn’t stop touching the different fabrics, running my fingers along the rails of clothes. It felt like i was re-exploring this world. Anyways, i am not sure what the deeper point of this caption is besides maybe a gentle reminder to find more awareness in your day to day life. Notice how things sound, feel, smell, taste, ... And what a miracle this life is. 🌹 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork
user_31;user_31189.jpg;The steel armour of my childhood suffocating my skin is crumbling into a million tiny liquid particles congregating into streams of silver gold perspiring through my pores An alchemy between my pain and my past My past and present were once lovers weaving rivers from origin to insertion Until it was no longer safe to be in flow with divine creation Instead i wrapped my tiny fingers around the handle of the pain handed down through generations and cut myself off from my source A poisoned heirloom gift masked as acceptance A rite of passage promising safety But in reality i was swallowing a slow death 🐍 . . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork
user_31;user_31190.jpg;I am reminded daily of how resilient this body is. The last years have been a wild ride. Moving houses each year, having big shifts career wise. And lots of soul healing 🦋. When i look back on the last three years, i can’t help but feel grateful for this body. The process was uncertain and scary but i am happy i took all the leaps and the risks to follow my heart’s desires. It has never failed me. This life has never pulled me under or punished me for following my heart’s yearnings. I have decided to take a week off from social media (although there is still a fun vlog coming at the end of this week on youtube). Just to celebrate this life and re-connect with my own body. To nurture it and give it all the pampering it deserves for carrying me through the transformation of the last years. This will be my first week off in a year #entrepreneurlife hahah 😅 Take care of your precious bodies! 😉 Playing around on my favourite Cork Mat from @myga_yoga ❤️ Also even though i am taking a vacay week, the meet-up is still on this saturday 😘 Can’t wait to hang out with you and chat over delicious food ❤️ . . . . #ad #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #londonyogateacher #plantifulsoulpresets #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation

user_31;user_31192.jpg;When i was younger i believed being independent was the highest form of maturity. When i first got into spirituality i heard teachers talk about non-attachment, whether objects or people. They told me that real spiritual people aren't attached to the people around them because everything is temporary and always shifting. You are born and you die alone. I swallowed their words like they were my own and never questioned how these statements made me feel deep down. I never questioned if it aligned with my own experience. After all they are spiritual teachers so must have this whole life figured out, right? But the more i walked down this path the worst i felt inside. A deeper part of me knew there was something gravely wrong with this view. This last year of digging into myself i have come to the realisation that there is nothing more spiritual than having deeply connected relationships with the people around me. It is through the relationships with others that i have started to understand myself better. We are social species and flourish with deep meaningful connections around us. At the core of it all we are all deeply connected in our wants and needs. And no one can escape the need of connection if they truly want to explore the depths of what it means to be human. I am not here to strive to become spiritual or enlightened. I was spirit before this life and will return to it after this ride is over. I am here to explore the depths of the human experience. Yes most of humans live with amnesia as to their true nature but once realised what is the point of trying to get back to that state of collective consciousness when we were put into this world with an individual consciousness? Why not explore this world full of duality before we re-merge with the collective? I no longer want to use spirituality as a way to by-pass my human experience 🦋 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #plantifulsoulpresets #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork

user_31;user_31194.jpg;"Sounds cliché but hey it's true, there is no planet B. We have only this one to work with and so far we aren't being very gracious guests. After watching the documentary ""A Plastic Ocean"" a few months back it solidified my passion for living a lower waste lifestyle. Here are some easy ways to reduce your waste and buy more eco-consciously: - Omit buying things wrapped in plastic: buy more loose produce and use your own produce bags, go to farmers markets, they generally have less plastic wrapped produce. Or find local farms that deliver veggie/fruit boxes to your house. Most of them will be fully plastic free plus you are supporting local farmers 🌟 - Buy second hand: not only will you save money but you'll prevent perfectly fine clothing/furniture/appliances from ending in landfills 🙌🏼 - Support sustainable and ethical brands: support those few small brands that take our earth into consideration when producing their products. This is one of the reasons why i accepted @myga_yoga 's request to be an ambassador. They are a small UK brand that is eco-conscious and every package that they send out come is carton which can be easily composted or recycled ❤ in the photo I am using their sustainably sourced cork yoga block, or what the Brits would call yoga brick 😄 . . . . #ad #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #londonyogateacher #plantifulsoulpresets #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #pinchamayurasana #forearmstand #forearmstandvariation"
user_31;user_31195.jpg;I have spent the last days in a daze of creation. My intuition is growing stronger the more i feed it with pure unfiltered creativity. It quite literally feels like the corset i tried to fit myself in is unraveling from its threads. Deciding to live more from my intuition these days has been a change long coming. I am glad she finally arrived. . . . For those who are doing the intuitive decision challenge with me, how are you doing? 🦋 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #plantifulsoulpresets #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork
user_31;user_31196.jpg;It took me a few years to get to King Pigeon. Even just the whole 'flipping the grip' felt alien to my body. I would watch tutorial and see these yogis effortlessly grab their toes and flip their elbow up to the ceiling. How in the world?! It felt like my shoulders weren't made to do that. . . Want to know how i got there after all? Swipe left to see the modification i used for a while until my shoulders felt open enough to go on without a strap. . . All you do is loop the strap around your toes, hold the strap with your same side hand and lift your arm by making a half-circle up, to point your elbow up towards the ceiling. Once you no longer feel a stretch, walk your fingers over the strap, a bit closer in towards your toes so that the gap closes a bit more. Also make sure to keep your hips levelled with the floor to get the most out of this hip flexors stretch 😉 . . I am using the beautiful @myga_yoga strap and super soft Terraza Vegan Suede Mat 💘 . . . . #ad #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #londonyogateacher #plantifulsoulpresets #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #kingpigeondemo #kingpigeonpose
user_31;user_31197.jpg;Oh how juicy it feels to connect back to my feminine energy. This little 'intuitive decision' challenge made me realise this morning how stuck i got in the masculine energy of go, go, go! Always setting goals and working my lil ass off. And even though i think goal setting is a helpful tool i can see now how it was enslaving me. I was trying to fill every 'dead' moment with things to tick of my list. It is starting to feel like i have a life now outside of 'work'. And even though i absolutely love what i do for a living, it's nice to have hobbies that are completely unrelated. How is the challenge going for you peeps? 🦋🌟 . . . #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #brightonyogateacher #plantifulsoulpresets #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #hollowbackhandstand #hollowbackhandstandvariation
user_31;user_31198.jpg;Today is the third day of what i call my 'intuitive decision' challenge. And a few of you have already asked me how to recognise that intuitive voice? . . To me, my intuition comes in the smallest whisper. It's a gentle guidance in a certain direction. And once i have made an 'intuitive decision' it feels like a relieve of pressure. But then wouldn't you end up not doing anything and being lazy all day? I actually noticed quite the opposite. Now that i have put my to do list to the side, i go with what i feel inspired to do. Not only am i enjoying the tasks more but i also finish them quicker than usual because i don't spend time procrastinating and resisting the experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️ . . Who else is taking on this challenge with me? 🦋 . . . #spiritualgrowth #spiritualawakening #innerpeace #saveyourself #healthylifestyle #yogateacher #thrive #vegansofig #vegangirl #mindbodysoul #healing #growth #liveandlearn #plantifulsoulpresets #lawofattraction #creativityflow #brightonyogateacher #yogateacherbrighton #oceanchild #naturechild #healingenergy #innerwork
user_31;user_31199.jpg;Who else is doing the intuitive decision challenge with me this week? 🌟 . . If you haven't yet read my previous post on choosing to challenge my little monkey mind by living a whole week based on where my intuition guides me, then definitely go read it. I will share each day of the following week how following my soul's nudges has influenced my day. . . Today I got woken up by my boyfriend whispering in my ear an invitation to go to the beach together. He's rarely up before me and i had been dreaming to go back to the ocean for a few days now 🦋 the best wake-up call i have ever gotten in my entire life i would say 😄 . . After a slow morning of celery juice, decaf coffee, light stretches and a bit of dancing, we made our way to the beach. . . From the moment i saw the beach peeping over the horizon i knew i would have a hard time resisting dipping my toes in, even though it was cold and windy today. My mind instantly went to all the reasons why i shouldn't: my feet would be wet and i didn't have a towel with me which means soggy shoes on the way back, the water would be freezing, plus the water was wild today. But then i remembered the promise i had made to myself, and i am glad i did 🌟Having my feet connect to the ocean was absolute medicine. . . What intuitive decisions did you make today and how did they influence your day? ❤ . . . #yogalover #yogateacher #igyoga #igyogafam #igyogateacher #yogaoutside #yogaforlife #yogastrong #strongfit #fitchick #leangains #yogainspo #yogainspirations #yogaplay #londonyogateacher #plantifulsoulpresets #yogainside #yogapracticenotyogaperfect #yogapracticedaily #spiritualgrowthjourney #spiritualawakening #spiritualawareness #yogabody #yogamotivation #pinchamayurasana #forearmstand #forearmstandvariation
