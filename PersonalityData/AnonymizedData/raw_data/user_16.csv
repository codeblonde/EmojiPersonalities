Also, if you didn’t catch it yesterday, I have a new video up (link in bio) sharing the 🎥 5 Life Lessons I Learned from My Plants!

user_16;user_161.jpg;Let’s talk about plants. 🌱 I’ve been thinking a lot about my love for plants and why we as humans are so drawn to them. The short simplified answer is that plants make people feel good. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So today on ze YouTube, I am taking you with me as I tidy up my home + do some plant-care, which is also a form of self-care for me. By creating an environment where my plants can thrive, I’ve also found there’s a lot our plants can actually teach us about life. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, here it goes... link in bio for 5 Life Lessons I Learned from My Plants! 🌱💕✨ OOTD: beautiful dress sustainably made by @the_mie ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #wellnessblogger #austinblogger #mindfullifestyle #plantsmakepeoplehappy #plantsofinstagram #iplanteven #makehomeyours
user_16;user_162.jpg;a peek inside my kitchen's utility drawer 👀 for my standards, this drawer could be more organized than it currently is... but that's alright. 😆 this morning, i want to share a few things in here that have helped us reduce our waste at home. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⊹ lids, lids, lids ~ from mason jars, yogurt jars, etc. ~ we reuse our jars for drinks, leftovers, and for storing bulk bin seeds, nut flours, and oats in our fridge. My rule of thumb to reduce clutter 👉🏼 if there is a lone lid that doesn't have a matching jar, we get rid of it. ⊹ reusable @stasherbag ~ these are an investment, but i use them endlessly for snacks, chopped produce, marinating, travel, and many more. ⊹ beeswax wrap to cover bowls instead of cling wrap (we also use silicone stretch lids which aren't stored in this drawer) ⊹ a jar of rubber bands from produce - we save 'em and re-use them to close snack bags, organize cords, etc. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ this is just a small glimpse into our efforts, but i personally LOVE seeing inside other people's drawers, cabinets, and pantries. I enjoy seeing how other people organize things... organization makes my heart happy. x ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #homeorganization #drawerorganization #lowwasteliving #lowwaste #organizationideas #simplifyyourlife
user_16;user_163.jpg;Remodeling our side patio was one of the BEST decisions we made this year. It's truly my happy place, and I spend a big chunk of my day out there... meditating, practicing yoga, drinking matcha, gettin' work done, and caring for my plants. With all of the sunshine I'm getting, you betcha I'm adamant about wearing my @bioclarity sunscreen every. single. day. and reapplying it every couple of hours. It's reef-safe, made with non-nano 100% mineral zinc oxide, and it actually blends super well into your skin (unlike a lot of sunscreens I've tried). Grab 15% off with the code OMCITY. #bioClarityPartner ~ And stay tuned for my patio tour comin' atcha sooon. #user_16 #makehomematter #howihome #patioinspo #patiodecor #outdoorpatio

user_16;user_167.jpg;Potting some plants...and LICKETY SPLIT 🌱 I've wanted a lickety split philodendron for a couple years now, and now SHE HAS ARRIVED [far right]. What should we name here?! ✨ She's a big one n' grows pretty fast (kind of like a monstera), so I never really knew where I would put one. But, I decided... who cares? I'll make space 😆, so I committed and right now she's just hanging outside on our patio. I'm excited to watch her grow!!!

user_16;user_168.jpg;Today is the day 🌱🌱🌱 One of my favorite plant nurseries in Austin (@greatoutdoorsaustin) has opened its doors. It's all outside + they have safety precautions in place, of course. I didn't realize how much I treasured my plant nursery trips until all the non-essentials shut down. I am so excited to take my mama to the nursery today, so we can pick up some more soil + a new plant baby or two hehe. ~ Here are a few of my favorite plant-y things: ✧ Favorite Potting Soil: FoxFarm (love the ocean forest blend) ✧ Favorite Fertilizer: FoxFarm Grow Big liquid fertilizer @foxfarmsoilandfertilizer ✧ Favorite Non-Toxic Pest Control: Organocide Bee Safe 3-in-1 Garden Spray for my outside plants that are more prone to buggies ✧ I also use my non-toxic all-purpose house cleaning spray/soap from @branchbasics to hose off and clean dusty leaves. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Got any more Q’s lemme know!!

user_16;user_169.jpg;Hello from me + my giant ass lettuce we just harvested 🥬 👋🏼 It's a fresh new week. While last week was very heavy, it was necessary... and I'm honestly very grateful for it. Growth is necessary, and it's often messy and uncomfortable. But leaning into the uncomfortable is an opportunity to expand what we know, acknowledge our own privileges, challenge what we've been taught and programmed, and unlearn what doesn't serve the kind of world we want to live in. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ There is still so much I don't know, but I'm committed to keep learning, and even moreso, to keep LISTENING. I am committed to educating myself on the interconnectedness of social justice and environmentalism. I am committed to supporting and spotlighting more Black-owned brands that are aligned with my values. I am committed to speaking up when I see brands that could diversify their marketing. I am committed to having more uncomfortable conversations with people I know in real life. I am committed to the understanding that this work is ongoing, and I will make mistakes and learn from them. Lastly, I am committed to the understanding that one of the best ways to use my voice is to vote vote vote vote vote... and that I will do. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sending you all love. Onward we go! x #user_16
user_16;user_1610.jpg;In an effort to show my solidarity without cluttering informative content that amplifies black voices, I want to share this quote from @iamrachelricketts. I just purchased her Spiritual Activism 101 online workshop, which I'll be diving into today. I hear it's a lot to unpack, but I'm ready to do the work. 🙋🏻‍♀️ You can check out her offerings via the link in Rachel's bio. There’s a lot of noise out there, and it can be confusing on what’s helpful and what’s not... but I am going to focus on listening and learning from black voices and activists.. and being careful not to just jump on a bandwagon in fear of being judged for not doing so. The time I spent confused about whether posting the black square was counterproductive or not, I could have spent educating myself. Oooof. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Alright... onward. ~ BlackLivesMatter. #amplifymelanatedvoices
user_16;user_1611.jpg;This morning we did a meditation with @dora_kamau via @insighttimer (my fave meditation app). It was part of a 10-day meditation course we signed up for called 'Self-Care in Times of Uncertainty'. Afterward we meditate, Andrew and I talk about what thoughts came up and share our answers for some of the questions Dora had us meditate on. It's 10 minutes out of our morning, but it's so important to hold space for one another before diving into our day. Thank you, Dora. Your meditations are so inspiring, powerful, and your voice is sooooo soothing. ~ Also, happy six year date-iversary, @acreea! Love you + yes I'm still going to celebrate our date-iversary even though we are married. ❤️ ~ #morningmeditation #mindfulliving
user_16;user_1612.jpg;We biked 16 miles this morning. We had been wanting to do this trail together for quite a while, and it felt GOOD to finally prioritize it. While on this trail we passed by so many different kinds of people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and body types. We are strangers, but we all had one thing in common. We loved to bike! 🚲 And it showed on everyone’s face, as we biked past each other with a big smile and exchanged quick hello, good morning’s. Feeling grateful for these micro interactions this morning that warmed my heart. ~ #atxblogger #wellnessblogger #austintx #bikelife #doingthings
user_16;user_1613.jpg;It doesn't feel like enough to sign a petition... to call our legislators... to donate money... to educate ourselves... to learn and unlearn... It doesn't feel like enough. Because these stolen lives can never ever be replaced. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But, we have a responsibility as humans living on this planet to do what we can to join our black brothers and sisters in this fight. It's not political. It's basic human rights. ~ Here are a few resources I've personally been looking into: ✧ Donate to joincampaignzero.org to help end police violence in America (please check out their site - so much information). ✧ Already shared this on stories yesterday, but you can still text 'FLOYD' to 55156 to demand the officers who killed George Floyd are charged with murder. ✧ This document created by @sarahsophief and @dj_diabeatic: bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Again... none of it feels like it's enough, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't put in the work. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I saved a highlight from my stories with another article sharing ways you can contribute.

user_16;user_1615.jpg;I was not always a minimal-minded gal (just ask my mama), but over the years, I’ve realized just how much a tidy and clutter-free home impacts my overall wellbeing. For me, having a clear space welcomes a clear mind, and I know this can ring true for so many of us. Noticing this connection between my home + my mind has created such a shift in how I care for my space. As a result, I’ve become so much more intentional about my consumption, knowing that clutter hikes up my anxiety.

user_16;user_1618.jpg;Hello ello! I uploaded my 25-minute power yoga flow to my YouTube channel for ya (link in bio). 🎥 Originally, I taught this flow for the liketoknow.it audience, so in case you missed it, now it's livin' over in tube land for ya. It's a short flow, but it packs quite a 👊🏼 if I do say so myself. Tag me if you do it! ~ Who's soakin' up the long weekend?! I wish I could say I am, but it's going to be a marathon work weekend for me.

user_16;user_1619.jpg;I finally tried the dalgona trend, and it went like... 👉🏼swipe to see. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I had no intention of sharing this video, because it was a failed dalgona attempt. But, then I saw my face... 🤣and just had to share. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ My face = It felt like a crime to waste matcha like this. Hahaha. But in all seriousness...not trying to hate on the trend. I just don't personally enjoy super sweet matcha. @matchaful is already so delicious on its own, and to use such high-quality, ceremonial-grade matcha and then mask it with sugar.... 🤷🏻‍♀️welp, I'm glad I finally tried it, at least! ~ #dalgonamatcha #matcha #dalgonafail #dalgona

user_16;user_1624.jpg;I've been 90% barefoot for the past 50+ days. You too? Well, one of our shelves fell down in our cabinet (see stories) and when I went to open the door, my favorite large mason jar came crashing down. R.I.P. I ended up stepping on a piece of glass. 🦶🏼Shoutout to @wellyfirstaid for rad fabric bandages that actually stay on (because we all know finding someone's used bandage on the ground ain't cute).

user_16;user_1625.jpg;"I’m a proud Korean American. But, I wasn’t always. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to “be less asian” at my predominantly white school. I used to laugh along to the asian jokes kids would make right in front of me, because I didn’t know how else to react. A friend once asked if I could do her nails, because I’m probably “naturally good at it”. I’ve been called someone’s “favorite asian”, instead of favorite friend. I’ve been asked if I see differently, because of the shape of my eyes. And I’m half Korean, so I know the experiences I had growing up were probably mild in comparison to some of my full asian sisters. ~ With the rise of xenophobia in the wake of this pandemic, and the already severely lacking representation + diversity in the wellness industry, me + my fellow Korean sisters would like to raise a mug 🍵 to #AAPIHeritageMonth.

user_16;user_1627.jpg;I woke up feeling like I should probably take a shower, but then I ignored that feeling. 🤪Takin' advantage of the grime + turning this Friday into a full-on *beast-mode* cleaning day. Clover is most definitely shedding her undercoat, the vents + fans need to be vacuumed/dusted, and I don't remember the last time we've done a full scrub down of the bathrooms. ~ I plan on working through the weekend anyways... might as well! We're workin' on some really exciting things, I've got no place to be, and I'm revved up to get it all out there for ya. ~ HAPPY FRIDAY! P.S.

user_16;user_1631.jpg;Let's talk about noise-cancelling headphones 🎧With Andrew being home + a newly adopted doggo, there's a fresh dynamic we're all navigating. We want to feel like we can move around the house, change up the scenery, and not feel stuck in one room with the door closed all day to get shiz done. So, these @Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 have been really awesome to have while staying focused + still getting to enjoy each other's company amongst the dogs barking, coffee beans grinding, and ample Zoom calls. #BoseAmbassador ~ These headphones not only have 11 levels of noise cancellation, but they also have a crazy good mic that isolates your voice while canceling the noise around you. I filmed a voiceover for my most recent power yoga flow using these headphones, and you didn't hear when the dogs started barking halfway through (phew). The sound quality is clear, crisp, and professional. ~ If wanna check it out, head to the swipe up link in my stories!

user_16;user_1632.jpg;"I’m overwhelmed by communication these days. I lose track of my texts, dms, emails, slack messages, and so on. There are so many modes of communication to check that it's hard to keep up, and I end up disappointing someone unintentionally. Now that we depend so heavily on technology to stay connected, it's resulting in increased screentime. This can do some wear n' tear on your mental health if you don't give yourself some space to disconnect. ~ So, if you're feeling like this or if you're on the other end feeling unseen or left hanging from an unanswered text, dm, email, etc.... let's all just try to find some grace for one another during this time. » For friends, family, and coworkers trying to work and still fulfill all of their other roles at home. » For the digital creators doin' their best to respond thoughtfully as just one person behind the screen + have lives outside of what you see on the 'gram. » For customer service departments answering thousands of emails daily + still getting berated for delayed orders. This still blows my mind. Patience, y'all. ~ Just remember the time we're all navigating in... It's not ""business as usual"". And we're all multi-hyphenate humans with roles, responsibilities, and obligations we are trying to fulfill, while still acknowledging our own personal needs. Whether you’re single, married, have kids, run businesses, all of the above or none of the above... we've all got our shiz to deal with. ~ Let's head into this week with a lil more patience, compassion, and understanding for one another!

Share in the comments 👇🏼 ~ My Worries: » My computer is giving me trouble, which has caused me stress, frustration, and it's making certain tasks take way longer than necessary. (My Solution: Call Apple to clear up space.) » The obvious state of the world. Businesses are starting to reopen in Austin. I feel anxiety around when I'll feel comfortable hanging out with friends, going to the movies, and just getting back into the world again. » P.S. Thank you all for sharing your hearts with me last night. We did a mental health check in and hundreds of you shared how you’re doing/feeling. I wish we could have one big group hug, but please accept my virtual hug and know that everyone is battling something. ~ My Wins: » I set 3 goals I wanted to have completed by end of week + 1 stretch goal. I'm on track to meet them ALL, despite the technical difficulties thrown at me this week. 👏🏼 » I spent at least 2 hours outside every day this week which resulted in a happier, less anxious, more joyful me. » It's Friday, and I'm making pancakes. ~ » 🌵BONUS: Today marks 2 years since we moved to Austin.

user_16;user_1634.jpg;If you made it to the end, leave a 💛in the comments! I know mindfulness practices can sometimes feel daunting. But, a little bit goes a long way. We all have the ability to pause, close our eyes, and focus on our breath for as little as 45 seconds. It's not about the quantity, but the quality of the time we spend pausing and tuning in. I know when I start to feel anxious or overwhelmed at work, this small but mighty moment does so much for my mental health. ~ #breathingpractice #wellnessblogger #mindfulliving #mindfulnesspractice #meditation #selfcare #selflove #atxblogger #txblogger

However, as I'm getting older, I've become more proactive about the choices I make NOW consistently for my longterm health. I first tried @ritual back in 2017, and I really love it.

user_16;user_1639.jpg;Meet @LettuceGrow 👋🏼It's a self-watering, self-fertilizing hydroponic Farmstand that makes it easier to grow your own food from home 🌱 without the experience, time, and space required for traditional gardening. It uses 95% less water, made from 100% recycled ocean plastic (it's BPA-free + FDA food-grade), AND it's freakin' stunning. ~ Here are a few stats for ya: » Average head of lettuce travels 1500 miles to reach your plate » 52 pesticides were found by the USDA on lettuce (including 3 possible carcinogens, 17 suspected hormone disruptors, 10 neurotoxins, and 14 honeybee toxins) » HALF of global food waste is enough food to end world hunger. ~ We are looking forward to eating closer-to-home, while also learning, growing, and bonding over what we hope is the stepping stone to a larger backyard garden one day! Can’t wait to see these babies grow - we will be sharing updates in partnership with the @lettucegrow team. ~ #user_16 #lettucegrow #eatgrow #hyperlocal #sustainableliving #hydroponics #urbanfarm #atxblogger #austinblogger
user_16;user_1640.jpg;Hello + Happy Earth Day (🌎which is every day) 🌱Sustainability is much like our wellness journey... meaning that it's not perfect nor is it a linear progression. Sometimes we move forward. Sometimes we move backward. It's the small actions we make consistently and can SUSTAIN that make a difference. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. Black or white. Zero waste or all the waste. ✧ What can we strive to continuously do day after day, year after year, while also acknowledging the great privilege it is to even have the resources to think + act on these things? ✧ maybe the first step is bringing your reusable bag and water bottle. I have a blog post on tricks to actually remember these items under 'Sustainable Living'. ✧ and maybe the next step is reducing your overall consumption and buying less on impulse or boredom. ✧ and next, maybe it's slowly swapping for cleaner, safer household n' beauty products as each item runs out - while continuing to use up what you already have. ✧ maybe it's analyzing your trash and working hard to make less of it... composting your food scraps is a solid place to start. ✧ And maybe you can choose to eat more local produce, and if you eat meat, choose to buy more of it from a local farmer or even better.. one that's regenerative. ✧ and most importantly, stay informed + show up at the polls to vote for the ones who support your causes. ✧ Remember, this is a personal journey. We're all navigating this within our own budget, lifestyle, and means. The world doesn't need more judgment for anyone's efforts or non-efforts. ✧ Whatever your motivation is, let's leave this place better than we found it. ✧ My shirt is from a collab with @go_upwest & @nikkireed (I look up to Nikki SO much) + 100% of proceeds go to @isfofficial to address important environmental issues. ✧ #user_16 #earthday2020 #earthdayeveryday #wellnessjourney #sustainabilityjourney #mindfullifestyle #mamaearth

user_16;user_1647.jpg;Rug swap 💫Glad we still had this rug from our old apartment! It was in the trunk of our car for the longest time, because we were planning to donate it. Luckily, this ole rug looks the same on both sides, so we just flipped it over and it's perfecto! We are doing our best trying to train Clover, but she still has accidents. I am VERY sensitive to smell (more than the average person I've realized), and dog pee is just one of those things that I absolutely will smell forever once it soaks in despite my cleaning efforts. And after the dogs knocked over my coffee onto the rug, welllll that was the last straw. We will see how she does on this rug... actually loving the look of it in here! ~ #CloverPleaseStopPeeingOnMyBeautifulRugs #dontspillmycoffee #homedecor #makehomeyourhaven #makehomeyours #sodomino #apartmenttherapy #bohodecor #bohemianhome

user_16;user_1651.jpg;"The day before our ceremony in Costa Rica, we planned an excursion day where our guests could choose to go hiking, waterfall swimming, or horseback riding. It was a blast! But, little did they know, we had a lil surprise planned for after lunch once everyone had returned/relaxed a bit. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 'Twas a slip n' slideeee! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ It was so fun to unleash our inner child, and it got wild real fast. Someone even dislocated their shoulder... but, it somehow popped back into place while en route to the hospital thanks to the bumpy back roads. It ended up being an epic day + an even more incredible evening with our rehearsal dinner and some spontaneous pre-wedding dancing. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I remember going to sleep that night thinking, ""how can it get any better?"" It was already the best week of my life, and the wedding hadn't even happened yet. I slept soundly under the stars knowing the next day I'd be married to my best friend. And yes, our wedding day was even more magical than I could have ever imagined. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I can't wait to share the full two-part recap with you all, but I also want to be mindful of this time we are in.

user_16;user_1652.jpg;~ today ~ cozing up with my pups, reading Outlander, and fertilizing my plants 🌱 ooof, and I finally decided to get an olive green linen duvet cover! It’s not easy keeping white/beige sheets clean with two doggos that somehow always have dirty paws (despite my efforts to clean them 😆). We are pretty lucky that these two don’t shed much, so that’s not really an issue. ✨ Anyways, I’m linking the sheets in my Weekly Wellness newsletter that goes out on Sunday (sign up via my bio link). They were very affordable compared to most linen duvets that cost in the $300-400 range. This one was under $200! ~ And our hexagon shelves were built by Andrew (I always get questions about this). ~ #user_16 #homedecorlovers #linenbedding #makehomeyours #bohodecor #austinblogger #simplifyandthrive #plantsplantsplants

user_16;user_1654.jpg;#thankyoufrontline 💕 My mama works in the cafeteria at a school in my hometown. Although I wish my mom could stay home to be safe, I know she’s got an important job to do. These ladies show up everyday (working 6 ft apart) to make breakfast & lunch for any student that needs a meal. No one is turned away. For some kids, this may be their only meal for the day. I want these ladies to know that they are appreciated, so as a small thank you I sent them each a Kroger’s gift card for groceries along with this virtual message. (My sweet mama is in the back left 🥰) ~ Spread the love & share your gratitude 🙏🏼 send a gift card to a healthcare worker, put a “thank you” sign in your window for your delivery people, tip extra for any food you’re getting... big or small, it all counts. ~ Tagging my bestie @not_so_grace_full to do her thang and share her #thankyoufrontline!

So, whether I’m soaking up the sun on my patio or taking the dogs for a quick walk in the neighborhood (#QuarantineLife), you better know I’m wearin’ SPF. ~ @bioClarity’s formula checks all of the boxes (and beyond) for my personal sunscreen standards. It’s mineral-based, reef-friendly with non-nano zinc oxide, and it protects from UV rays, blue light from our devices, free radicals, and environmental pollutants. Total skin protection and daily hydration to leave your skin looking + feeling healthy for the long run! ~ ALSO, now through April 7th, @bioclarity is donating 1% of sales made on bioclarity.com to Feeding America’s COVID-19 Response Fund.

user_16;user_1666.jpg;First of all, hi everyone. How are you doing? I am sending each and every one of you all of the virtual love and healing energy I can muster through this screen. With everything going on, the mandated social distancing, + the constant barrage of depressing news, I thought it’d be a good idea to round up some nourishing soul food from this incredible community. ~ If your soul needs a break, then this post is for you. We gathered some inspiring quotes and stories from our Om Community (link in bio). No matter how this world shifts, it fills me with so much hope to see this community coming together + supporting one another through all the highs AND the lows. ~ On another note, consider taking a break from the news. I have had to severely limit the amount of time I am spending reading the news, scrolling the feed, and the overall input of information. Why? Because my soul can’t take it. It’s important to stay informed, but that doesn’t mean you need to soak it up all day like a sponge. If you can, open up your windows, go for a walk, get some fresh air and spend time away from your devices. This isn’t going away anytime soon, so we need to do what we can to stay not only physically well, but mentally well. Love you all. ~ #socialdistancing #mentalhealthmatters #upliftingquotes #positiveenergy

user_16;user_1668.jpg;Since we will be spending most of our time at home for the time being, Andrew and I sat down + made a list of things we’d like to do (non work-related). Swipe over to see our list! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Our weekdays will still be spent working from home, but it’s interesting to see how much time opens up when you’re not making plans and going out and about to meetings. As an introvert, I’m more social than I realized 😂 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I also want to make sure I don’t slip into nonstop “never leaving my desk” mode, and actually give myself these breaks that I’d normally have when I see friends, go out to the movies, and hang out around town. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Anyways, I’d love to see your lists, what you’re doing at home (or secluded out in nature), and how you’re making the most of this unfortunate time we are living in. Hopefully we can inspire each other to explore our curiosities and do the things we didn’t have time to do before! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This beautiful, special dress was a gift from the @sezane team, and I love it so much. It's incredibly well-made, surprisingly heavy with all the embroidery, and it's something I am going to make sure I take the best care of so it lasts a lifetime. I just dropped it off at my favorite tailor's house (Nora of I.N.A. Tailors is amazing).

user_16;user_1678.jpg;UPDATED BLISS LIST ❊ If you’ve been following me for a while, you might have seen me share my “bliss list” a few times. I’m always adding to it, because it’s a good reminder to myself to do more of what I love. Or moreso, MAKE TIME for it. Today feels like a good day to update that list... so here it is. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ MY BLISS LIST 2/29/20 ⊹ long sunny walks with @lunaandclover + matcha in hand ⊹ forgetting to check my phone because life is gewd ⊹ the joyful feeling of a clean + clutter-free home ⊹ a freshly stocked fridge with all the colors of the rainbow ⊹ finding a new fave song thanks to @spotify's release radar ⊹ knowing what my body needs and honoring it ⊹ late night moped + taco nights with my husband ⊹ and this feelin' of peace, love, and contentment with life at this very moment ~ What's on your bliss list? ~ Soakin' up this Saturday with my babes before I have to jet off to San Diego for work tomorrow ☀️Wearing @richerpoorer (gifted), which is basically where all of my cropped tees are from.

user_16;user_1679.jpg;"MEET CLOVER ROSE ACREE 🍀 She's a super sweet 1-year-old(ish) Mini Australian Shepard Mix (we think maybe German Shepard?). Clover was originally an ""outside dog"" in Smiley, TX. The story is she escaped one day, and the city pound picked her up on the side of the road. They notified the owners, but they never came to get her. So, Passion for Paws in Nixon, TX rescued her before she was euthanized. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ We are so happy she found her way into our arms. She's our ""four-leg Clover"", and the name just popped into my head within the first minute of holding her. The first day was an adjustment for Luna (as you know if you've watched my stories), but now they are playing so well together that it makes my heart want to explode. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Clover is currently 18 pounds, and she's not expected to grow much bigger. She's the perfect size for scooopin' her up + Luna loves being the big sissy (Luna is 35 pounds for reference). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ We love our girls so much. We weren’t sure if the dynamic was going to work at first, but we went on a walk yesterday morning and passed by some graffiti on the sidewalk (last photo) - in that moment we knew it was our sign that she was our girl and everything would work out the way it should. So, here we are! 💕 #user_16 #cloverrose #rescuepups #adoptdontshop"
user_16;user_1680.jpg;We've been shakin' things up over at #TheOmHome 😆I don't know why, but it seems like every time we finish up one big thing (i.e. move across the country > buy a house > get engaged > plan a wedding), we jump into the next big thing. It's not intentional, but I also think it's just the way I'm wired. I'm a Libra with an Aquarius rising, INFJ, someone analyze me. 😆 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, here we are... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ We've had about 1.5 weeks of post-wedding chill, and the next thing I know, I'm sitting at home writing this with two doggos by my side. This photo was only snapped a few days ago, but if I were to retake it right now, there'd be two black doggos starting up at me hoping I'll drop a blueberry. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ That's my life right now. Thank you all for your messages + advice on introducing a new pupper to the Acree Abode. Today has already been SO much better, and the fact that I'm able to sit here in silence to write out my thoughts says a lot. It really helped reading all of your experiences + words of encouragement - I freakin' love this community so much. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As I mentioned on my stories, we are taking the week to test this new dynamic and to make sure Luna will be happy with a new sister in the home indefinitely. Luna is a complicated gal, which I knew going into this, butttt she's warming up. I haven't shared any photos of this new pupper, because I don't want to get too attached if it doesn't work out. I'll just say, she's really, really sweet... she LOVES Luna. She's like her little shadow. She's about a year old, and she seems to be potty trained which is 💯. She woke us up at 2am to go to the bathroom - we're all exhausted, but very happy she knows to tell us! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Anyways, that's my lil update :) Time to get back to werk! P.S. I am looooving TikTok?! 😂 Swipe to see what I’m up to over there. #user_16 #kitchensofinstagram #composting #makehomeyourhaven #makehomematter

user_16;user_1684.jpg;"Sneaky peek of our aaalmost finished guest room 👀next Tuesday I'll be sharing the full shebang. ✨ I'm a big believer that true wellness begins at home, as your environment plays a major role in your mood which then impacts your motivation + focus. Since embarking on my simplifying journey a couple of years ago, I've felt the impact firsthand of how an intentional, ""less is more"" approach to a physical space can have a positive wave-like effect on so many other areas of your life. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I recognize I don't have children, so it's very easy for me to declutter + control what goes in and out of our home. However, the idea of essentialism (MUST READ book by Greg McKeown) can be applied to absolutely anyone no matter what stage of life you are in, no matter where you live, or how much money you make. For me, it's not about the ""stuff"". It's about the intention behind the stuff + whether it adds value, function, or simply JOY to my life. And, my friends, it’s a continual daily practice. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ P.S. There's always room for more plants. 🌱 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE MORE. In the meantime, how BEAUTIFUL are these prints by @janskacelikart + frames c/o @framebridge?

user_16;user_1685.jpg;"Morning Matcha Thoughts 💭 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ It's my first full day back in the Om Office after takin' off two weeks from my biz to get married. It was the most incredible time off, and I gave + received the most love I've ever felt. But, today, it's my first moment of solitude and stillness... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ *Cue the negative self-talk + the feelings of not being enough, not knowing enough, not impacting enough, and overall feelings of ""not-enoughness""* ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ There's so much shifting internally for me, and I haven't had the brain space to really process it all. The last thing I want to do is hop back on the hamster wheel when there's a loose screw. So, this week I'm focusing on re-aligning my values with my passion, my purpose, and my work. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ HOW? ✧ Re-establishing structure in my schedule. ✧ Not overloading my calendar with plans + meetings. ✧ Writing, writing, writing... a list of my values, a list of what lights up my soul, a list of what I'm doing now that I love, a list of what I'm doing now that I don't love. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Today is a fresh opportunity to get quiet + to process. Today, I'm going to listen to myself think a lil more. Today, I acknowledge that I don't really know what I want right now, and that's okay. It’s scary, yet exciting. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Writing this out, and sharing it with you all in case you may also feel like you're livin' in limbo. You are enough - in all of your seasons. No one has it together all the time. Meet yourself where you’re at and make the most of it! Sending love to all my sisters of ze ‘gram. ✌🏼💕 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #simplifyandthrive #simplifyyourlife #matchalatte #matchamornings #createyourlife"
user_16;user_1686.jpg;Married AF ✽ and lovin’ the sight of a ring on A’s finger. ~ Been getting some Q’s about our rings, so I’m going to answer here: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✽ Andrew’s ring is from @markenewyork - He did their home try-on program + aaaalmost went with yellow gold, but he ended up choosing a matte white gold, and we engraved “J + A 2.8.20” on the inside. It’s perfect for him. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✽ My wedding band was made by our family friend in Kentucky who also made my engagement ring. They’ve known me since I was a wee lass, so it’s really special. I found the initial inspo on Pinterest and despite not ever trying something like that on, I knew it’s what I wanted. I love it so much. We are going to solder the two rings together, so it stays in place. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ aaaand that’s the story behind the rings! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Photo by @carmelisse.love // P.S. the longer I stare at my hand is this photo the weirder it looks 😂 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #user_16 #newlyweds💍 #mindfulwedding #theknotweddings #theknotrings #acreeweddingretreat

user_16;user_1696.jpg;NEW BLOG POST ~ How to Take Time Off From Your Biz (and Why You Should). Link in bio! ~ Most entrepreneurs can relate when I say that “my biz is my baby”. No one cares about it as much as you do, and no one knows it better than you do (although, my biz manager Lauren is pretty darn close). For me, the wheels are always turning, and it doesn’t just shut off when 6pm hits. However, I’ve worked very hard to set boundaries, uplevel my purpose-driven productivity, and learn how to be more efficient with where and how I spend my time. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I’m getting married in Costa Rica this week. Wow, what? Crazy. It’s finally happening. This will be the first time ever in the history of running my business where I actually DELETE the email app (among a few other work apps) from my phone while I’m away. This is one of several things I’m taking action on in order to take time away from my biz, dip my toes into “vacay mode”, and hopefully allow myself to stay present during this very special moment in mine and Andrew’s life. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, whether you’re gettin’ hitched or are simply itchin’ for some true-blue time off, this blog post will give ya some ideas of how to do it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Aaaalright + that's the last blog post from me for a couple weeks! Finishing up packing, errands, vow writing, and we're off to Costa Rica TOMORROW. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Big thanks to @away for always havin' our back with top-notch luggage. We love you + appreciate the gift! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #wellnessblogger #entrepreneurlife #februarywedding #travelaway #wellnessentrepreneur #mindfulliving
user_16;user_1697.jpg;In honor of vow writing... Luna, when you first wagged into my life I knew you were the one.

I vow to honor you, cherish you, and feed you carrots and peanut butter for the rest of our lives together. Thank you for being the best dog daughter a gal could ever ask for. ~ 😂 ok byeeee #user_16
user_16;user_1698.jpg;Yesterday’s posing post-massage at @massageheights! It’s interesting how we often have an easier time makin’ the move on a $100 piece of clothing versus $100 for self-care services like a massage or even therapy. We’re drawn to the tangible. Yet, we deserve to invest in our body, spirit, and mind just as much as some new shoes. As I’ve gotten older it’s the money I’ve invested in my inner workings like self-care & personal development that I really see (and feel) the value in. Just some food for thought! ~ I go to Melanie at @massageheights in Mueller, and she’s wonderful. I could really get used to these monthly massages 🙌🏼 I was really doing it leading up to the wedding to manage stress and my TMJ, but mayyyybe I’ll just have to keep on goin’! 🙋🏻‍♀️ ~ Wearing this beautiful handcrafted fanny pack by @wearemandrn started by my gal @kellkong!

I'm actually deleting my email app from my phone starting next week. Phewie. My Weekly Wellness newsletters will still go out as scheduled, but it will be written by my gals Lauren + Caitlin from the Om Team, so I'm excited for you to meet them and read their Sunday musings n' brain juice. ~ As for Insta, it's super important to me to unplug + stay present throughout the wedding festivities.

user_16;user_16108.jpg;Y'allz remember when I had that mental breakdown during the holiday break? I chose to eat popcorn two days in a row (I'm allergic to 🌽) and all in all, was just livin' it up with my family eating *all the things* despite knowing my allergies + reactions. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Welp, I woke up with hives, inflamed/splotchy skin, brain fog, and just overall felt like 💩. Not to mention, I noticed SO many gray hairs sprouting, and it just felt the icing on top of an already disastrous lookin' cake. I vowed that I'd honor my body and let go of feeling guilty for inconveniencing anyone with my food allergies. Especially leading up to the wedding, I want my skin + gut to feel good. So, I've reeeally been holding myself accountable since. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This month, I've felt 💯. I've eaten delicious foods that make my body feel good from the inside out, I've stayed hydrated, I've stuck with my tried n' true weekly @bioclarity clarifying masque, as well as been using the Floralux serum to keep my skin glowin', AND I even resisted the urge to make popcorn for Bachelor Mondays 🌹.

Open to never quite knowing what's next. // Woke up this morning, drank matcha, whipped out my old yoga wheel (see stories), and worked on regaining my back flexibility. It's a fun challenge. Rather than compare myself to the back-bendy postures I used to be able to do (#yogaeverydamnday Jules circa 2015-2017), I'm meeting myself where I'm at. It's been fun rediscovering my strengths n' pushing myself to not give up when it's not coming as easily as it had before. So, cheers to a fresh new chapter in my ever-evolving practice. 🌱#user_16 #hapayogi #wellnessblogger #mindfulliving #apartmenttherapy #hometour #livingroominspiration #minimalhome #bohodecor
user_16;user_16112.jpg;hi, i really like my outfit today... so, it’s got me feelin’ like a bonny lass. Oy, I’ve been watchin’ too much Outlander. But, who are ye to tell me, how much is too much? I dinna ken. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If you know what I’m saying, because you’re also an Outlander fan, please let’s discuss in the comments. I’m rewatching the whole series... I do this for shows I reeeally like such as Merlin (seen entire series 4 times) and One Tree Hill (I binge this anytime I‘m 😷). I’m on my way to the library to pick up the first Outlander book. 👍🏼 ~ What’s your favorite show you’ve ever watched? ~ #user_16 #minimalista #capsulewardrobe #overalls #everlane #everydaymadewell
user_16;user_16113.jpg;He said yes! 👊🏼You're my best friend, my teammate, and the one I love most in this world. There are no gender roles. We both cook. We both clean. We're both killin' it in at our jobs. We are both independent + completely whole individuals with our own passions and interests, but when we're together, we're a creative force to be reckoned with. Thank you for sacrificing your spice level 🌶on food, just so I can have a bite. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Big thank you to @markenewyork for gifting Andrew his beautiful wedding band. We feel so lucky + it was one less thing to worry about this month. The 14k gold is responsibly-sourced and it's all made-to-order in NYC. The home try-on program made this process seamless. We can't wait to see his actual ring when it's ready (he's wearing the try-on in this pic!). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #futurehusband #ethicallymade #mindfulliving #createyourlife #weddingbands #theknot #theknotrings #matchalover

From your low-waste patternmaking and integration of recycled materials to your dedication to local and ethical production, I'm SO proud of everything you've built.

user_16;user_16117.jpg;"Less is more when it comes to storing makeup! Especially if you use clean beauty, it's important to pay attention to the expiration date. I'm very adamant about finishing up what I have before opening up a new product, so that it stays fresh. It has also kept me from becoming a skincare hoarder. 👀 Ya know what I'm talkin' about. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When I was in college, I had so many opened, half-used bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotions, foundations, serums... you name it. Some of my makeup would be over a year old (maybe more...), and that's not great for anyone's skin. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Fungus, mold, and bacteria growth is very important to keep front of mind. We're so scared of ""toxins"" that we want all-natural everything, but then we keep these products longer than we should and it grows harmful bacteria which can be just as harmful. Just something to keep in mind! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Oh, and wash your makeup brushes this week! x Love y'all ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #cleanbeautytips #homeorganization #drawerorganization #bathroomgoals #minimalista"

While this year was really incredible and full of adventure, love, and personal growth, it was also a very difficult + emotionally draining year for me. I explain more on the blog. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2019… you were quite a wildcard. You pushed me to my breaking point not one, but several times. You challenged my limits, you made me question my worth, and you made me PROVE my resiliency. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But, here I am… almost on the other side of this crazy year. I am walking into 2020 very damn excited to live and experience the ultimate culmination of all 2019 pushed us to do in preparation for this upcoming year. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ And this photo kind of sums where next year is headed :) I love you all.

Tired of having one thing after the next. We sat in our car in the parking garage for 15 minutes going back and forth... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ""No, it's too late to cancel."" ""Ugh, but I feel so guilty.""

user_16;user_16124.jpg;Cheers to Sunday self-care + gettin (the good) shiz done ~ here's what I'm diving into today: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ♡ Deep water my houseplants (minus the cacti/succulents) - every few months I put my plants in the shower, drench them with water, clean off their dusty leaves, and let the excess water drain in the tub for the day. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ♡ Deep clean my teeth - I use the @philipssonicare DiamondClean Smart toothbrush, and it has a deep clean mode that I use every Sunday, in addition to flossing regularly. I love that my toothbrush has a timer that sections my teeth cleaning into four parts... there's a pause-and-beep indicator, so I know when to move onto the next section. #philipssonicare #ad ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ♡ Deep clean my house - I clean out the fridge, wipe down the microwave, vacuum the baseboards, and clean behind furniture.

user_16;user_16129.jpg;"I am hyper-focused on my dental wellness ever since... a few months ago I went to the dentist + I found out I had, not one, but FOUR cavities. 🙈 I was shocked (and embarrassed). I've only ever had cavities in my baby teeth... never my adult teeth. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ My dentist brought to light two major points... ✧ I needed to sleep in a mouthguard, because the clenching was weakening my enamel + contributing to the fractures. ✧ I have naturally deep grooves in my molars (where the cavities were) which makes it harder to clean my teeth if I'm using a manual toothbrush. My dentist highly advised I get an electric toothbrush. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, here we are... I went down a rabbit hole searching ""best electric toothbrush 2019"", and @philipssonicare kept comin' up to the top. After reading + comparing reviews, it was clear that the DiamondClean Smart was the right model for me. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I traded in my lil bamboo toothbrush for this baby, and I know it was the right decision for me + my dental wellness. My teeth feel SO much cleaner. I love the timer, the different cleaning modes, and the fact that 2 minutes of sonic brushing gives you the same amount of brush movements as 1 month of manual brushing. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Before I decided to partner with @philipssonicare, I did a deep dive into their sustainability efforts + I was very happy to find that the Philips brand... ✧ committed to becoming 100% carbon-neutral from operations to sourcing all electricity usage from 100% renewable sources by 2020. ✧ are in the midst of transitioning into a circular business model of ‘Make › use › return’ in four returning loops: service, refurbish, parts recovery, recycle. ✧ has for the 6th consecutive year been placed on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Climate Change A-List. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Proud to share this top-notch product with you all + to encourage you to be proactive about your dental hygiene... because filling cavities ain't cheap. 😆 Cheers. #PhilipsSonicare #ad ~ #wellnessblogger #electrictoothbrush #austinblogger #atxliving"

user_16;user_16137.jpg;✈️ Sometimes, it seems like I just unpack to repack. Anyone feel me? 🤣 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Despite how often I travel, I still can get quite anxious. From the hectic security lines, the fear of crashing anytime there’s turbulence 😬, and the overall adjustment that comes with being in a different place on a different schedule. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Here are a 5 things that have helped me ease stress or anxiety from travel: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Pack light + efficient (or check luggage) because hauling a ton of sh*z and trying to find something in your over-stuffed carryon is stressful. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2️⃣ Apply for TSA Pre-Check or Global Entry - Our credit card waived the global entry fee, so it was a no brainer. Now, I can breeze through shorter security lines without taking off my shoes or taking out all of our electronics (and we’ve got a lot of that 📸 💻🔋). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 3️⃣ Take CBD oil to relax + to help me sleep well in new places. @Beam is my go-to trusted brand (THC-free, broad spectrum, 3rd party tested). I’m notoriously a restless sleeper if I’m anywhere but home. It takes me time to adjust, so to avoid the tossing + turning I take .50-.75 ml of @beam under my tongue before bed, which helps my body + mind relax, allowing me to sleep well through the night (code: Jules15 for 15% off @beam) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4️⃣ Give yourself space + time. If you’re always rushing to get to the airport on time, do your best to set alarms and get there earlier. Same goes for your schedule once you land... I am a big planner (especially for work trips), but I’ve learned to relax a bit on this and leave room for spontaneity and unexpected events. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 5️⃣ TRY not to stress over things you can’t control. If there’s traffic getting to the airport, it is what it is. Nothing you can do, but accept it and flow with it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ HAPPY TRAVELS wherever you may go! Onward to Costa Rica we gooooo ✨ ~ #user_16 #wellnessblogger #traveltipsandtricks #mindfulliving #createyourlife

user_16;user_16143.jpg;"Meet my luffa (or ""loofah"") 🌱 it's a natural sponge that I use in the shower to exfoliate... it's also technically a vegetable. The entire gourd was given to me on a farm tour here in Austin back in September. I peeled off the skin, let it dry out on my window sill, shook out the seeds, and cut it into 4 pieces. Using this luffa has been game-changing for my skin in hard-to-reach areas, specifically my back, shoulders, and arms which went from bumpy to now soft and smooth. It's my favorite part of my shower routine + I can't wait to plant the seeds to grow our own luffa next year! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Do some googling to see if there are any luffa farms near you, otherwise, you can also find it online anywhere from Etsy to Amazon. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ A few tips: ✧ Let it air out + dry outside of the shower after each use to prevent bacteria growth. ✧ Replace every 3 weeks. I recommend cutting it into small pieces, so a little goes a long way. ✧ For extra cleanliness, consider boiling or microwaving it once a week. ✧ Chuck it in the compost when you're done! It's biodegradable. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If it sounds like too much work for you, then a good ole washcloth might be a better eco-friendly route for ya!

user_16;user_16147.jpg;One year ago today, I said YES to the love of my life, my best friend, my 8th-grade crush, my AIM fling (my screen name was lovedogs91), and the most kind-hearted, goofy, adventurous man I've ever known. I love you, I love our life we’ve created together, and I love knowing that we are a team through thick and thin. You make me SO happy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ THANK YOU ✧ for inspiring me to play, explore, and create. ✧ for believing in me on the days I have trouble believing in myself. ✧ for always bringing me a glass of water when you come up to bed. ✧ for reminding me that popcorn hurts my stomach even when I BEG YOU to make it anyways. ✧ for always being open to hearing my crazy ideas + epiphanies. ✧ for saying 'YES' without hesitation when I want us to put our phones away for the night. ✧ for making even the most mundane tasks feel enjoyable by singing, whistling, and dancing while raking leaves, pulling weeds, or picking up dog poop. ✧ for being a badass at teaching yourself how to do absolutely anything! ✧ and lastly, the quality that I love most about you... thank you for being a friend to every human you meet, for not thinking twice when you see someone who needs help, and for always being the light at the end of any dark tunnels. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ LET’S GO CELEBRATE, RIDE OUR BIKES, AND EAT REALLY GOOD FOOD THIS WEEK, okay byeeee! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #engagedlife #theknotrings #weddingwellness #mindfulliving #bridetobe2020 #gettingmarriedsoon

user_16;user_16149.jpg;✽ Today on the blog, I'm sharing 5 Things I'm Letting Go of This Holiday Season (link in bio!) ✽ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Each year around this time... I get this surge of energy + anxiety to wrap things up for the year and plan ahead for the new year. I feel powered on 🔌⚡️ to get shiz done, but I also tend to skew on the side of feelin’ overwhelmed. Who gets me? This year, however, I’m approaching the holiday season a bit differently. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As my wedding is quickly approaching, I’ve been working smarter, so I can take about a month off from work to truly enjoy this exciting milestone in my life. That means being very, very intentional about who and what gets my attention and saying ‘no’ to any additional projects that have a deadline between now and my February wedding. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ In addition to simplifying my workload, I’m simplifying my mindset for the holidays. 🧠That pressure to “do all the things” and buy all the things… I’m letting that go. It’s a beautiful time of year that often gets stressful real quick when we lose sight of what it’s really about. While this time of year certainly looks different for everyone, at its core, it’s all about gratitude + togetherness. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, join me in simplifying the holidays by makin’ space for what really matters and showing up for yourself in the same way you show up for others. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Peep the link in bio for 5 things to let go of this holiday season! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #holidaystress #stressmanagement #holidayanxiety #simplifyyourlife #simplifyyourwork #mindfullife #minimalistholiday

user_16;user_16151.jpg;A lot of time is spent worrying about the past or worrying about things that haven't even happened yet... Today, I'm reminding myself that life is so much sweeter when you take a deep breath, count your blessings, and get OUTSIDE. ~ Despite the errands, to-do list, and work obligations that spilled over to our weekend, we managed to take an hour to do a lil hike + take in the beauty of this city. ~ Feelin' festive in my @athleta shimmer tights from last year & sherpa jacket (faux) which basically feels like I'm wearing a cozy blanket.

user_16;user_16152.jpg;I always start my day with matcha. It’s part of my morning ritual that I look forward to when I wake up + it’s what makes me feel the best. However, in the afternoons (only 2-3ish times per week), I’ve been enjoying switching it up with a french press coffee concoction. Since coffee tends to make me anxious, I’ve found I can better handle it with CBD oil (@beam). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But why not give up coffee altogether? Well, because I don’t do well with extremes. I really enjoy the cozy taste of coffee, so I don’t want to “ban” it from my life. Therefore, this is what’s been working for me lately + when I do make it, it’s reeeally freakin’ special + delicious. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Here’s what’s in my cup: ♡ French Press Coffee (usually a local ATX brand, but I am always changing it up) ♡ Organic Cashew Butter (got this idea from a cafe in Arizona!) ♡ Splash of Organic Maple Syrup ♡ Splash of Pure Organic Vanilla ♡ Sprinkle of Organic Cinnamon + Cloves ♡ 0.50 ML of @beam CBD oil (my go-to trusted CBD that’s THC-free, full spectrum, + third party tested for quality) ⇢ BLEND IT ALL UP + serve up that frothy goodness! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Mmmmm. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Get 15% off of @beam w/code Jules15 #ForBetterEverything ~ #saturdayvibes✨ #wellnessblogger #wellbeingwarrior #mindfulliving #coffeebreak☕️ #homeofficedecor #homeofficeideas #minimalista #minimalisthome

user_16;user_16154.jpg;My Closet Makeover + Organization Tour 🎥 is live on my YouTube channel (link in bio). ~ After several months of feeling frustrated with the disorganized chaos in my closet, I finally bit the bullet and invested in a custom closet system. While Andrew and I have separate closets that are identical in size, we each have different needs. A’s closet was meeting his current needs, and mine was not. So, here we are! ~ Peep the link in bio to see the process, before and after, the backstory, and how much it cost. 💵 With this new system, the entire closet space has been maximized.

user_16;user_16155.jpg;Peace out, NYC! See you again in two weeks✌🏼I only packed one pair of jeans for this 5-day trip (Proud #LightPacker) - my tried n' true high-waisted + classic straight jeans from @Madewell [ad]. It's Fair Trade Certified™, and it's a big step forward for this big retailer. When you see this label, it means this denim was made in certified factories that must meet rigorous social, environmental and economic standards. You can read more about it on their site. This is just the beginning. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I'm all for cheering on big retailers when they make big efforts towards a more fair, sustainable, and ethical future. Change takes time. Not to mention, no one can deny Madewell has mastered the fit of denim, as well as, put thought into the end life of it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Jeans shopping used to be such a daunting process for me, but now I've got my go-to styles (many of which I've had for YEARS + they still look just as rad as day 1). And when I no longer need the pair, I can always recycle them with Madewell’s Blue Jeans Go Green program 👖. You get $20 towards a new pair for every pre-loved pair you recycle. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #wellnessblogger #everydaymadewell #doubledenim #atxblogger #denimondenim

user_16;user_16158.jpg;The first look 👀💕✨ my gal @tiameghan snapped a shot of me right before seeing my wedding dress IRL for the first time! For the past several months I’ve been working with my friend @loulettebride on designing this dress, and so far it’s been sketches + mockups. Once I slipped on my actual dress yesterday, it finally started to feel REAL. Despite how stressful planning a wedding can be (no matter the size), putting on my dress really eased my worries because now I can truly see myself walking down the beautiful grassy field at @kinkaracr and seeing the love of my life + all of our favorite people together in one place - and at the end of the day, that’s all that matters to me. I’m SO excited. ~ #user_16 #costaricawedding #weddingplanningtime #wellnessblogger #loulettebride #theknotweddings

I ride my bike to my favorite spots, pull out all of my gear (as listed above), and I put pedal to the freakin' metal. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ A note on @livelarq ~ I shared this innovative water bottle with you back in April, and I'm so pumped to re-introduce you, because it has basically been glued to my hand ever since. If you watch my stories most days, then you know this already. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ LARQ is hands down THE bottle I reach for when I'm heading to work, to a workout, and for travel. I always always always bring it with me on my trips, because the built-in UV-C light purifies water + cleans 99.9999% of bacteria. So, I refill my bottle wherever, and I don't have to worry so much about the tap water quality. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ You can now find @liveLARQ at @Nordstrom - and for my NYC friends, you can also check it out at the new Nordstrom Flagship that just opened up... might have to pop in myself when I'm in town this weekend. #LiveLARQ #ad #DrinkBrilliantly ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 📷: First photo was shot on the iPhone 11 Pro!

user_16;user_16161.jpg;Today on the blog, I'm sharing how to make your bedroom a peaceful retreat! This is something that Andrew and I continue to make a priority since our previous apartment, and even more-so now that we’re settled in our new house. We want our room to be a calming space to decompress, connect with one another, relax and be present. We're also very careful about what items we allow into our space and are consistently decluttering, purging, and reorganizing. This ongoing practice of simplifying my life has been one of the best acts of self-love for me personally. I can say that I LOVE our bedroom, and because we’ve been really intentional about what comes into this space, it truly feels like somewhere that we can rest and recharge. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Peep the link my bio for my 7 top tips + go out there and create your own version of peaceful bedroom bliss. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Big thanks to @parachutehome for this cozy waffle robe + slippers. Luna 🐶 has indeed already tried to eat one, but I promise I'll take better care 😆 I'm a big fan of #ParachuteHome - all of my linen bedding, towels, and my mattress topper is from there and I can tell ya it's well worth it if you can swing it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #TheOmHome #minimalista #minimalhome #homedecorinspo #sodomino #makehomebeautiful #minimalisthome #simplifyyourlife #MyParachuteHome

user_16;user_16164.jpg;"I know, I know... Halloween is over. But, let me just have this one last post where I get to appreciate these short-lived bats. I shall be packing them away, and you betcha, I'll make sure to get these up a lot sooner than the day AFTER Halloween. Yeah, I suck, but at least the party was dope! 😆[For those asking, you can just print a bat template off of the interwebs, fold black cardstock in half, trace it, cut it out, and use painters tape to secure it to the wall]. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Anyways, I've been thinking a lot about how crazy this year has been. How I really pushed myself out of my comfort zone this year. I'm proud of that. And I want to do more of that. The more I push myself to say yes to uncomfortable situations that require me to grow, the more fulfilled I am. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, here's just a short and sweet Sunday reminder that it's okay to feel afraid + not quite ""ready"", but go for it anyway because that's where growth + transformation live.

user_16;user_16165.jpg;Okay, last night was so fun ~ every party should require a costume 👻 here’s a recap of our first official Halloween party at #TheOmHome! ~ I’m an elf princess (dress found at vintage shop for $45 + made my crown with fresh flowers!) + Andrew is a dark knight (made his costume the night before using cardboard boxes we had in our garage). ~ Bats on our wall were made by neighbor of the year @audkoh!

user_16;user_16166.jpg;Halloween always creeps 🕷 up on me. JUST when I thought I was going to have to whip out my Wonder Woman costume I made in college for the FOURTH time (swipe 👉🏼)... I found something rad. My friend @audkoh and I were perusing through the racks of a local vintage party shop, and we both found some epic gems that were between $25-45.... and they are both so beautifully-made! We decided our costumes are too good to just sit on the porch and pass out candy to kids... so now we're throwing a Halloween party. 🎃🎉 So, that's what's goin' down tomorrow night. Can't wait to show yoooou - although, I already shared a sneak peek on my stories the other day because I'm too darn excited. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I'm going to try to make a real flower crown for my costume... 🌸 but I don't want to make any promises that it will ever see the light of day, because I've never done it before and I MIGHT fail. 😆 We shall see. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Even though I'm retiring my Wonder Woman costume this year, swipe through to see me rockin' it in 2013, 2016, and last year 2018. It's still my proudest creation. My friend sewed my cape, while I cut + sewed some blue leggings I found at Goodwill into booty shorts and ironed stars on it. The bodice was from Charlotte Russe (remember that store? lol), my boots were from a Super Girl costume in high school, and the accessories I made from scrapbook cardstock. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ OH, and I have no clue what Andrew is going to be this year... he's going to make some magic with some cardboard boxes we have in our garage 😆 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ What are you all doing tonight, tomorrow, this weekend?!! ~ #user_16 #mindfulhalloween #matchalatte #matchalover #halloween2019🎃 #wellnessblogger
user_16;user_16167.jpg;NEW VIDEOOOO! 🎥 As the seasons are changing, I thought it’d be super fun to share some of my *most worn outfits*. Link in bio (& consider subscribing to my YouTube!) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I’m a proud #outfitrepeater, and overall I love encouraging others to shop more mindfully and to get the most out of what you already own. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Since setting on my simplifying journey a couple years ago, I’ve been able to reclaim my power and create my own confidence by cultivating my own personal style, along with aligning my spending with my values, and not just buying for the sake of buying. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Adopting a more minimalist mindset has directly and positively impacted my quality of life, and although it’s a continual, imperfect practice, the more I exercise my ability to CHOOSE, the better my choices become, and the more empowered I feel. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I hope this video inspires you to embrace your own style, invest in clothing you love, wear the heck out of it, and to create more space in your closet, in your home, and in your life so, too, you can find more joy with less. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #user_16 #simplifyourlife #simplifyandthrive #minimalista #capsulewardrobe #everlane #sustainablelifestyle #wellnessblogger #atxblogger #mindfullifestyle

While it's not nearing extinction, it's being monitored due to the popularity and over-harvesting. ~ I have a bundle of sticks that I've received in gift bags from brands or from friends over the years, but I won't be going out of my way to purchase any myself at this point. I'm going to enjoy what I've got left - it's such a calming and comforting scent. ~ Anywhooo, just wanted to share that with all my palo santo lovers out there. I know there are companies out there who harvest sustainably (only harvesting the branches that have already died and fallen off the trees). Butttt, I think over-consumption as a whole is the issue whether it's harvested 'sustainably' or not. 💭 ~ Wishing you all a beautiful day ahead! My house is a MESSSS right now, so I'm taking an hour today to pick up + reorganize our kitchen pantry. Tomorrow, I'll focus on decluttering our bedroom.

user_16;user_16179.jpg;IT'S LIVE! 🎥🎥🎥 My very first home office tour, comin’ atcha from inside our Austin, TX abode 🏡 ~ link in bio to view the FULL video tour + blog post, along with links to all ze things. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I’ve been self-employed since January 2017, and since then my workspace has had quite the evolution. I can’t even express how incredible it feels to finally create a space where I can really harness my focus and let my creativity thrive. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ While having my own office is certainly a dream come true, it didn’t come easy nor did it happen overnight. We often see photos of someone’s current life on Instagram and not understand the full context of what it took to get to that point. I share on the blog more of the emotion behind what this home office means to me and how it represents a milestone in my journey as an entrepreneur. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Why am I sharing all this? Because I think transparency, backstory, and context is vital in a world where comparison is inevitable, and everyone seems to have their sh*t together. I want you to know, it wasn’t just ‘poof, here I am’. And I most certainly don’t always have my sh*t together! 😆 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This office, and our entire house is a big milestone, and it marks the beginning of a new season of our lives. So, with that said, I’m excited to continue exploring my curiosities, creating with purpose, and being in alignment with what lights me up. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Thank you to my designer @erikadale/@platteinteriors from @decoristofficial for yet another project designed + completed together! You're theee best. ~ #TheOmHome #homeofficeideas #homeofficedesign #workfromhomelife #apartmenttherapy #minimalhome #wellnessblogger #sodomino #makehomeyours
user_16;user_16180.jpg;Hi, I'm Jules 👋🏼 I'm a true libra, #INFJ, and my love languages are words of affirmation + quality time. I'm a half Korean / half Irish #ProudHapa from a small town in Kentucky. Writing has been the most constant passion of mine. I was actively aware of my love of writing in 5th grade, when I got the flu and had to stay home from school for what seemed like forever. I filled a blue spiral-bound, wide-ruled notebook with pages and pages of poems and song lyrics. I still remember how I felt when I looked back at all I had written. Since then, writing has been a form of expression and self-care for me. I am an old school pen to paper kind of gal, but eventually, I started sharing my writing online via Tumblr, LiveJournal, Xanga, Blogger, and eventually it led me to start my wellness blog in 2013... Which brings me to today. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ It's the longest I've ever stuck with something. And it evolved into me not only writing for my own self-expression, but to write in a way that can also help others. And that has been my driving force as I've navigated through this complex world of entrepreneurship... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ There's an unspoken pressure to keep up with the evolution of this digital space. And it pushes us to venture into channels of expression we didn't think we could before. When I get frustrated with photo, video, editing, production, marketing, accounting, and my neverending inbox... I remind myself I'm still a gal who loves to write, express, and connect. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When I get lost or lose touch with why I started... I think of 5th grade me, and I think of the FEELING attached to the work I do and how the things I create have the ability to bring joy, inspiration, and new learnings to another. That feeling motivates me to keep creating, keep evolving, and keep endlessly creating the life I want to live. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ How about you, my friend? What do you do when you feel lost? How do you get realigned and refocused? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #mindfullifestyle #wellnessblogger #createandcultivate #atxblogger #homeofficeideas #discoballplanter #simplifyyourlife #minimalista
user_16;user_16181.jpg;When we first moved into our new house 🏡, I mentioned to you all that I was having a hard time finding my groove. My morning rituals + routine are very clutch for me, because it's how I get centered and organized for the day. However, my old morning routine just didn't feel fluid in this new house... it felt forced. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ And quite frankly, I just loved being in our new space. I was having a hard time waking up and leaving my man + doggo for my 6am workouts. I felt FOMO. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, I took a few months to experiment... I slept in more, enjoyed slower mornings with my lovebugs, made pancakes, and didn't pressure myself to fall back into any sort of routine. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ After 4 months of random + not-so-grounded (but lovely) mornings, I'm happy to report I'm feeling BACK IN MY ELEMENT. I'm glad I took that time to adjust to our new surroundings, yet I'm reeeally the kind of gal who needs a more structured morning in order to thrive creatively. 💫 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I'm back to my early AM workouts that finish right as the sun rises. 🌅 I'm back to feelin' that good kind of sore. I'm back to feelin' strong, active, fluid, and focused. I feel like ME. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When I feel sore after a workout, I love a good foam rollin' sesh + some @beam CBD salve. It's got 5 simple ingredients, one of which being 500mg of organic phytocannabinoid-rich CBD oil (no THC). It's v effective for relieving sore muscles + taming inflammation (I even rub it on my stomach when I'm feeling bloated). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If you're coming to Austin for ACL or if you're local, @beam has a popup here for the next three months! Check it out downtown (209 West 2nd Street). It's a gorgeous shop + you get to learn more about their rad, super high-quality products in person. When you're buying CBD, it's important that you do your research + ask ALL the questions + and be picky! The best brands will have no problem being 100% transparent with you. #forbettereverything #beampartner ~ #homeofficedecor #homeofficeideas #wellnessblogger #morningroutines #morningrituals #purposefulproductivity #simplifyandthrive
user_16;user_16182.jpg;Even though they are everywhere here in Texas, Agave plants never cease to amaze me. They are so big, beautiful, and majestic. I learned some interesting facts recently that made my love grow even stronger... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ❊ the #AgaveAmericana lives an average of 25 years ❊ it will eventually grow a beautiful towering flower stalk up to 15 ft tall...sometimes even taller (I saw an article of a stalk that was 38ft!) ❊ once the flower blooms, the agave plant actually starts to die. ❊That's their cycle of life... it spends its entire life getting enough food and energy to bust out this gorgeous stalk, and then it goes out with bang. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, now when I walk around town and see agaves that have bloomed, I feel extra sentimental knowing that agave is about to die, yet lived a nice long life. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ P.S. Austinites 🌵, don't forget our PLANT SWAP PARTY with @thepapercraftpantry is this SUNDAY, 10/6 at 2pm! RSVP via the link in my bio! It’s going to be SOMUCHFUN. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🌱 🐆 Sportin' some rad leopard powervitas from @athleta take me from that mat 🧘🏻‍♀️, to my morning power walk 🏃🏻‍♀️, to going out and about ✨.

user_16;user_16184.jpg;"WHY YOU SHOULD START BEFORE YOU'RE ""READY"" // Today on the blog, I'm giving a lil pep talk on why you should stop stalling or waiting for the ""right"" time before going after what you really want. I share why I think you will never be 100% ready for the next big thing, and sometimes you just have to take the leap and lead with your heart, even when you fear the unknown. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If I’ve learned anything about being a creative entrepreneur, it’s that you have to ditch perfection. More often than not, making moves (no matter how big or small) is always better than feeling stuck or stagnant. It’s great to have big dreams and ideas, but it’s the taking ACTION part that sets people apart. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Fear + comparison have a tricky way of getting into our heads and convincing us we need to have all of our ducks in a row before we can take any step forward... but here’s a little secret, none of us really know what we are doing. But as you start putting yourself out there, you learn new things about yourself, your work, your passions, and you will end up becoming your own greatest teacher simply by EXPERIENCING life through your lens. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Peep the link in bio. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #user_16 #personalgrowth #femaleentrepreneurs #workfromhomelife #atxblogger #atxlife #wellnessblogger #wellnessentrepreneur #createyourlife"

user_16;user_16186.jpg;"We're just a little over 4 months away from our wedding in Costa Rica! So, naturally... I've been thinking a lot about what simple steps I can take now in order to feel really.damn.good from the inside out on our Big Day. 👰🏻🤵🏻I don't support the mindset of ""shredding for the wedding"", but I do understand wanting to show up as your most elevated + joyful + radiant self. I want my skin to glow✨, my gut to cooperate🤪, and I want to feel boldly confident all around.💁🏻‍♀️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ So, here are 3 things I'm focusing on: ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ◇ Reduce stress levels > say 'no' more, daily meditation, and keep going to hip hop dance classes (personal goal hehe! IT'S SO FUN!) Dancing + music personally helps me build confidence! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ◇ Don't be lazy about skincare routine > drink more water, don't skimp on @bioclarity's Floralux (I'll explain more below), keep on dry brushing dead skin before showers. Book monthly massages that focus on relaxing shoulders + jaw (TMJ struggles). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ◇ Breathe & Trust > Enjoy the process! I shy away from the parties, showers, registries and all that jazz, because I don't want people to have to spend money on me. But, I should know I have the most incredible people in my life who are so excited to be a part of this adventure! I'm beyond grateful, and I will embrace every minute of it. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Alright, so WTF is Floralux? It's @bioclarity's chlorophyll-based serum that is a staple in my routine, because it make my skin glow + fights zits n' redness. 🌱Chlorophyll is also found in matcha (hello, bright greeeen!), and it's known for being incredible for the skin. It's hands-down my favorite product they offer, so I recommend you check it out! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Use my code OMCITY for an extra 15% off your entire order. Keep tagging me if you try it.

user_16;user_16187.jpg;From aerial yoga and #SUPyoga to hanging with horses and honeybees 🐝 ... it’s hard to believe this was all in a span of 48 hours. Andrew and I had a lovely time at @miravalresorts here in Austin! It was filled to the brim of diverse adventure + learning experiences.

user_16;user_16191.jpg;It's okay to be blessed AND stressed. In fact, it's 100% human, and your feelings are always welcome and valid here. 👊🏼 This past month has been a high-stress one for me with many ebbs, flows, crashes, twists, and turns. It inspired me to write about my ✨5 Tried & True Tips to Realistically Manage Stress (link in bio). ✨I even whipped up a *free* stress reduction + prioritization exercise, because it's how I personally unblock myself during unexpectedly stressful times. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Despite the fact that no one enjoys feeling stressed, we've got to meet our stress with some level of gratitude.

user_16;user_16192.jpg;"First thoughts as soon as I hit the water... ""I need to do this more often."" My assistant Jaz and I spent the morning kayaking before work, and it was such a refreshing start to our day. We watched the sunrise, and the water was so peaceful.

user_16;user_16193.jpg;I first started taking CBD oil (no THC) in the fall of 2017 as part of my gut healing protocol from my functional med doctor. I had also just quit the #birthcontrolpill after being on it for 9 years... another step in my protocol. To make a VERY long story short, most of 2018 was me figuring out my body again and understanding what supplements work, what doesn't, what foods are ok with my gut, and how to manage my anxiety + mood swings from PMS that the pill had masked. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Now that I've had my gut issues under control for the past year (2019 = the year me + my gut became friends again), it has been really good for me to simplify my routine now that I know pretty damn well what my body needs. I mean, I earned it at this point. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ CBD oil is one of the few supplements I've continued with. Why? Because a dropper-full at night under the tongue helps me relax + sleep more soundly on the nights I need it. And a few drops in my morning matcha helps me focus when I feel anxious about my workday. It also helps for traveling when my stomach gets inflamed after enjoying foods I know I don't digest well (oops). I've been able to test + truly isolate how CBD benefits my life after this entire gut-healing saga. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I've learned so much throughout this journey and although I've been approached by hundreds (I'm not kidding) of CBD brands, @beam is the first + only brand I've ever decided to enter a partnership with. Their product is super high quality, transparent, and it all boils down to trust. I'm excited to continue sharing more about this amazing brand, because not all CBD is created equally. There's not a lot of regulation in the industry, so it takes extra effort + research on our end to make sure we're getting what we're paying for. I hope to share more insight on this + what I look for in quality CBD. I'm working on a blog post about this, so be sure to drop any Q's in the comments below. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Be sure to check out @beam + snag 15% off w/ code Jules15! #ForBetterEverything ~ #wellnessblogger #matchalatte #guthealing #atxblogger #matchagreentea #dailyrituals

user_16;user_16199.jpg;I went to yoga at @wanderlustyogaatx this morning, and I couldn’t hold any of the balancing postures if my life depended on it. Tree pose, eagle, warrior III - nada. I was wobbling all over the place and just felt so unbalanced. Usually when that happens, it has not as much to do with the physical body, but it’s moreso a reflection of my noggin 🧠. For me, it was one of those mornings where I was all in my head, and despite going to yoga to find some clarity, my overthinking mind wouldn’t surrender. 👽 I don’t have anything profound to say, except that our mind + bodies need something different everyday. Some days you’re feeling mentally strong AF and your body just flows with ease, and other days you’re fighting it and holding onto tension, stress, and anxiety. It’s okay to have those mornings, but it doesn’t have to define your day. I’m back home now, and I’m writing out what I really need today and how I can carve out time to make that happen. That’s essentially what mindfulness is. It’s simply becoming aware of your thoughts and feelings and saying, “hey, I see you, I feel you.” Then, it’s up to you to take empowered action and make the shift you need.
