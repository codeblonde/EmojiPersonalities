user_15;user_150.jpg;I finally released my recipe for chả giò chay! These are the veganized version of my family's style of Viet spring rolls, and I'm so proud of them! They have a great juicy but not too wet texture and hold up very well throughout frying! 🖤 You can freeze the batch and have them at the ready to fry anytime to have spring rolls for a party (and in these times, I'm mostly talkin a household party because safety!) Recipe is live on the blog and the video is up on the channel! Swipe up links in stories. 🖤 Also low key I am super proud of myself for rolling them so well! So much practice and I'm getting closer and closer to my mom's and my grandma's skill level 😁 although they are easily 2-3x faster hahah. Oh well. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #user_15recipes #bestofvegan #vietkieu #vietkieu #chagio #chay https://bit.ly/2zSnAuu
user_15;user_151.jpg;"(AD) Been seriously needing some comfort food lately that is flexible with this hot and cold weather, so we've been eating @usaricecan pretty much every day! Because let's be real, #riceislife. Just posted this recipe for cilantro garlic rice on the blog for this refreshing vegan fish ""taco"" bowl, but I've been cleaning out the fridge with kimchi jiggae, more braised eggplant and vegan thit kho, risotto, and this kimchi stir fry (can you tell I've had an excess of super sour kimchi lol)  We're still limiting our grocery runs to only be about once a week, so having pantry staples like rice is so helpful, especially since we cook it so many different ways. I'll leave some links in stories for you to check out the cilantro rice recipe! It's my go-to method of using up cilantro before it gets sad and wilty in my fridge haha.  #USARICECAN #ThinkRice #5Days5ways #usarice #rice #user_15 #user_15recipes https://bit.ly/2BfEKT4"
user_15;user_152.jpg;Today I managed to actually bake a successful focaccia! The process is in my stories and the Carter highlight if you haven't been following the sourdough starter saga. But yes! Finally a success :D Thank you to @itslizmiu for coaching me with Carter!  In other news, this week has also been a pretty heavy week in the world, so please take care of yourselves: continue your anti-racism (and anti-oppression) education sustainably, hold businesses and people around you accountable, move your bodies, eat what you want, and drink some water.  #user_15 #whatveganseat #carterthestarter #focaccia
user_15;user_153.jpg;Crunchy twigs, soft dirt, birds chirpin, and soft wind blowin' through the leaves. Sore feet, out of breath, tender back and damp hair. No place I'd rather be than alongside some trees.  I'm very behind in a lot of work but am working hard to catch up. It's been a busy few days, but I have some delicious recipes coming your way soon.
user_15;user_154.jpg;After a couple rather hot weeks, I've put Carter the Starter in the fridge because he was just SO hungry, I was burning through flour so dang fast. I tried making sourdough pizza dough with him, and while he was tasty, he didn't rise at all and the dough itself was kind of a failure.  I think I'll have to rehabilitate him a bit with a few feedings to revive his yeast production (for him to actually rise) but for now, I'm going back to eating nothing but steamed rice and Viet style dishes. I've been making thit kho over and over and just bought more eggplant to make the mushy eggplant haha.  In other news, very thankful to the #vegansquad (@twomarketgirls, @plantbasedkristy, @meatfreeathlete and we were missing @avraepstein) for introducing me to @adfrntbooklist: a local book store (I believe Black-owned) that features books from BIPOC writers and delivers! I ordered @sistahvegan, Aphro-ism by Aph Ko and Syl Ko, and @sweetpotatosoul's cookbook! We had a really deep discussion on Zoom talking about how the vegan community has reacted to BLM, what we've been doing to better amplify melanated voices, and what we can do to continue our anti-racist education.  Thankful for such an inspiring and incredible group of women to connect with. I also am still working through @laylafsaad's #meandwhitesupremacy (I'm only on day 3 though), but have placed holds on Robin Diangelo's White Fragility and Stamped by @jasonreynolds83 and @ibramxk. Eddie and I watched Dave Chappelle's 8:46 on YouTube. It was pretty powerful.  Also I finished listening to @aliwong's Dear Girls 😂, which was very graphic but powerful and reminded me that I have a lot of work to do to continue to connect to my Vietnamese heritage and maintain that connection so I can pass that on to our future family one day.  Off to do some work and then stream some more Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Just started it last night and I love it 😭😭😭 What are you up to this weekend? What have you been reading/watching?  #user_15 #carterthestarter #whatveganseat #bestofvegan
user_15;user_155.jpg;So it's been a pretty exhausting week for a lot of y'all, I've been seeing so many people fighting against racism, showing up, speaking out, and opening their eyes to white privilege. I hope that you are pacing yourselves and finding the balance of levity and education, because this is not something we learn in a week and carry on with our normal lives. This is a great shift in how society sees the world. This will take time for systemic change to happen, and requires effort from everyone to implement it over the rest of our lives. 🖤 I will always be posting about that good good vegan food but I think it's high time that I actually follow through with my claim to intersectionality and walk the walk to informing yall. It's hard to make mistakes and I admit that me not being more loud about anti-oppression work is unacceptable. 🖤 I've seen A LOT of folks unfollowing me and others who are speaking out because YOU feel attacked and just want to continue to look at pretty food and ignore the injustice. Being able to escape seeing injustice in your social media is a privilege that BIPOC do not have. They are living this exhausting reality of injustice every day. Think about that when you hit unfollow me or anyone else who simply cares about Black lives (or trans lives, Indigenous lives, Asian lives, or animal lives). Do better. Educate yourselves. 🖤 Now that I've gotten that off my chest, here's a picture of me eating Carter the sourdough starter's discard as fried starter à la @lifebymikeg. Oil, scallions, and some sesame seeds? Hell yes. Also, I've tried making focaccia twice with my extremely aggressive starter but both have been incredible failures that are tasty but gummy and dense atrocities. I will be refraining from making sourdough bread until I can master the simple focaccia haha. 🖤 Anyway, I hope you are all doing okay. Taking care of yourselves, eating good, and supporting some wonderful Black creators, I'll add some to my 🖤 highlight. (Also I have just learned about using the capital B so I apologize for not knowing better before). 🖤 #whatveganseat #user_15 #bestofvegan #sourdoughstarter
user_15;user_156.jpg;I've been trying to listen, stop posting my food content and #amplifymelanatedvoices as per @blackandembodied, but some of you have critiqued me for not posting in my feed to show my support. Thank you to those have been encouraging me to use my platform and holding me accountable.  I've donated to @colorofchange, @blklivesmatter Toronto, the Toronto Protestor Bail Fund, and purchased @laylafsaad's #meandwhitesupremacy to continue my journey of learning how to dismantle systematic racism and be a better ally. I've also purchased a class from @sistahvegan in the past, she is also an amazing educator and does a ton of work to intersect anti-racism and veganism advocacy. Links to these places to donate can be found in the 🖤 BLM highlight.  For many of you who are new to anti-racism work and want to do better, I'm sure this is very new to all of you and you may feel afraid of making mistakes or saying the wrong thing. I have been making my own mistakes throughout this, but what matters is we continue this work after the media coverage of the BLM movement subsides.  Support black businesses! I've only mentioned it in passing before but always try to seek out black, vegan, and women/LGBTQ+ owned businesses. Boycott brands that are problematic, and try to have the difficult conversations with your friends and family about anti-racism and anti-oppression so that we can offload that labour from the black community.  It is exhausting to educate people over and over why what they say or do (i.e. all lives matter, tone policing, supporting problematic businesses) contributes to systematic oppression. That is why we as allies, with fewer headwinds (re: my privilege gnocchi post), need to do that work in our social circles to reduce that work for black voices.  All this work to educate yourself on how to be a better ally to black people of colour can be translated to how to be a better LGBTQ+ ally, a better feminist ally, and a better person. Social justice is intersectional, and as vegans who are compassionate, we MUST be compassionate for the black community that has been grieving and oppressed for the past 400 years.  #blacklivesmatter #intersectionality
user_15;user_157.jpg;Today I'm gonna talk about privilege. I know this is all very overwhelming for those who are new or unsure about how to navigate learning about social justice, so I'm doing what I can to help.  Swipe to read because it was too long to put in the caption.  More to come.  Picture of vegan caesar salad to grab your attention and because this is all I've been eating lately.  Thank you to those who have been holding me accountable. Thank you to those who have educated me. I am listening and I will do better.  #blacklivesmatter Learn about how to be anti-racist from the courses by @moemotivate.
user_15;user_158.jpg;Struggling with the weight of the world lately, I'm just having a hard time feeling optimistic about humanity right now.  They deserved better. Remember George Floyd. He was trying to start a new life. Nobody deserves to suffer like that. Those 9 minutes must have felt unbearably long.  It's hard to stand together during this time but black people of colour are dying for simply living their lives. Sleeping in their own homes after working long hours as an EMT. Going for a run in their own neighbourhood. Doing what they can in a system that is out to get them since before they were born.  It has to stop.  #blacklivesmatter  I'm still figuring out how I can help, but at the very least I can remind you that we all need to do our part and do something.  Donate to the families, @colorofchange, @blackvisionscollective and @mnfreedomfund  Call or email to demand #justiceforgeorgefloyd #justiceforahmaud #justiceforbreonnataylor Support and listen to BPOC. Don't expect them to tell you what to do. Educate yourself. @torontoveganmom recently posted a list of books I will be adding to my list to read.  Follow @sistahvegan @ihartericka @rachel.cargle @blklivesmatter @blackhistory @bryantterry  There's definitely more to do, but I'm still figuring it out too.
user_15;user_159.jpg;It's too hot for soups right now (although I'd probably still be down to eat some soup lol) so I made a vegan caesar salad! I have an older recipe for caesar salad dressing using silken tofu, but I didn't have any so I used vegan mayo instead haha. A lot more rich but honestly, kind of better🙈 🖤 A super tasty dinner that is just the perfect thing before scarfing down some vegan ice cream 😂😂 I'm back to my ice-cream-once-a-day times which reminds me of how Eddie and I would go for ice cream all the time when we first started dating 🥰 🖤 Hope you are staying cool out there 🌞  #user_15 #whatveganseat
user_15;user_1510.jpg;The last of our local cherries from last year 🍒
user_15;user_1511.jpg;My fridge was completely cleaned out (both in terms of fresh food and cleaned drawers/shelves) and it has been very nice to actually have space in the fridge. 🖤 This soup was the last of our cabbage, carrots, and celery. We used some @beyondmeat sausages for protein and teeeeeny tiny pasta (like the kind in wedding soup). Added the @betterthanbouillon veg chicken stock I found at the @thevegangrocerystore, some thyme and some mushroom broth powder and voila! An empty fridge and a pot o' soup! 🖤 We went on a very long hike today and we are very very tired. Gonna be sleeping well tonight 😴 hope you all got to enjoy some nice weather today! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #cleaningoutthefridge #cookupinlockdown #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1512.jpg;Cleaning out my fridge with a newfound appreciation for the practicality of casseroles. I've been working on a head of cabbage for about two weeks now, and I find that it lasts longer when I pull leaves off as I need, rather than cutting through the head as I need it. 🖤 I used my vegan tuna casserole recipe as a base, but used cabbage, onion, celery, peas and slightly overcooked mung beans to mix in the sauce. Turns out the secret to getting Eddie to enjoy more veggies is to chop em up small and smother them in a creamy sauce 😂 🖤 Now my fridge is fully out of vegetables, although I do have some frozen peas and corn and a block of frozen spinach, but I am craving fresh vegetables haha. Gonna try to stretch that out over the weekend so we can do a big shop on Monday. 🖤 I already love my fruits and veg (obviously, as a @producemadesimple ambassador) but I really am thankful that we still have access to fresh produce during this time thanks to so many essential workers. We have been so much better about food waste because we've both been home to eat and we have been cooking everyday to use what we have instead of going out to eat when I felt too tired. 🖤 Also as a general and genuine plug (AD..?), I am thankful to Produce Made Simple for teaching me so much about produce over the years. Learning how to best store produce, what vegetables play well with others and which spices and herbs bring out the best of your fruits and veg—all of that knowledge had made cooking at home easier and better. And hopefully that knowledge passes onto you (either through their website or through me and my fellow ambassadors). 🖤 Overall I'm just feeling very grateful today. That's all haha. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #eatmoreproduce #producemadesimple #eatyourveggies
user_15;user_1513.jpg;"Been on a spring cleaning click lately! Deep cleaned the fridge, gonna wipe out our oven after using ""clean"" mode on it yesterday (that was the first time I had ever done that and that was very hot and scary to see), I cleaned part of my office this week and I'm hoping to get to the baseboards and reorganize my closet sometime this week. 🖤 Also hoping to hike later this afternoon after finishing up Saturday's video and get back to a bit of the springy trails! I love seeing all the buds popping off and the trees starting to wake up and work on being their lush leafy selves. 🖤 Have any of you been feelin that cleaning kick? I feel like so many were doing that at the beginning of quarantine but I was too busy being a sensitive bean to be productive until now 😅"
user_15;user_1514.jpg;Stretching out some of the veggies in the fridge with a simple stir fry. I used a myriad of seasonings: soy sauce, vegan fish sauce, mirin, mushroom broth powder, a pinch of MSG, cornstarch, hoisin sauce, and white pepper. 🖤 I used soy curls as my protein, I attempted to fry them with a cornstarch crust but with only a tiny bit of oil, but that didn't work so great. Next time I'll just airfry or bake them if I can't be bothered to properly deep fry them because otherwise they keep that gritty starch texture from the cornstarch coating 😅 🖤 My cycle has destroyed my ability to work in the last week. I was feeling achey, bloated, and sluggish, and yesterday was my last day. I managed to get outside and go for a short 45 min hike, and am feeling much better. I'm really missing the routine of going to the gym (my basement is just not that appealing) and am worried about how the gym will be once things open back up again. 🖤 But, in better news, I actually finished finished my stupid taxes and paid them AND paid off my student debt today. I am now completely debt free (aside from our mortgage) and I can't really believe it. It took me 8 years from finishing my master's to pay off my poor financial decisions from my early twenties and it feels good to be here. I know this is random but I felt like sharing haha. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1515.jpg;I used the crisp topping from my apple crisp recipe to use up some of the cherry filling I made last week. Eddie wants me to make pie but I really do not enjoy making pie crust (even though I have a really easy and flaky pie crust recipe on my blog). 🖤 We ate it in a day 😂 maybe I need to use a bit less sugar though. 🖤 Been feeling pretty bleh lately, but the weekend has been a bit of a reset for me to get things back on track. Hope you all have had a wonderful long weekend and hopefully enjoy some nice weather! It's very gross where we are now and all I wanna do is go on a hike :( 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 http://bit.ly/VeganAppleCrisp #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #eatmoreproduce #producemadesimple
user_15;user_1516.jpg;Craving the flavours of abroad: this ube gelato by @christophersgelato from @zerowastebulk 😭 i crushed this ULTRA creamy jar of the most luscious gelato in 3 days and I just want more!! 🖤 So thankful for all these amazing small vegan businesses that are keeping our bellies full of ridiculously delicious food and flavours from all over! Curbside pickup at ZWB was a breeze so I highly recommend picking up some goodies from them. We also ordered the strawberry gelato and it was equally creamy and delicious! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #zerowastebulk
user_15;user_1517.jpg;I reduced a bunch of the aquafaba I made from cooking up dried chickpeas last week and turned them into pavlova!! I used @threadandwhisk's recipe for aquafaba pavlova and topped with some frozen local tart cherries I saved from getting a giant bucket at Costco last year. 🖤 Turned most of it into cherry pie filling (just added lemon juice and sugar until it reached that sweet tangy balance I like, then added cornstarch slurry until thickened). It looks better when the filling is heated/room temp but I was too lazy and just scooped cold cherry filling on top haha. 🖤 So much delicious! Sweet and juicy local cherries months before summer and crisp and chewy pavlova as a base! I highly recommend using a stand mixer for this haha, it's a lot of work to do by hand! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #letscookvegan #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1518.jpg;Been feeling so weirdly overwhelmed lately so I haven't been doing much creatively, although I've been doing a lot of cooking and cleaning, and doing some slightly overdue taxes (I mean they extended the deadline so it's fine but my mom is an accountant so she's hardcore judging me lol) 🖤 Three days of spreadsheets, receipt logging and digging for mileage logs and I am done (I think). Have I been bingewatching Never Have I Ever while logging an absurd amount of food shopping receipts? Yes. But now I am thankfully done 🥴 🖤 Anyway, I've been loving how fast y'all were with remaking this vegan tuna casserole I posted on my channel last week! It was the perfect comforting dish I needed to get me through the week. Hope you are all having a wonderful Friday and may you have a lovely and relaxing long weekend with good weather! 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #quarantinecooking #cookupinlockdown https://bit.ly/3clLCvZ
user_15;user_1519.jpg;Happy Mother's day, mama 💕 we've been through a heck of a lot the past few years and I'm so grateful for all the sacrifice you've made to make a better life for me and Minh. 🖤 My mom came to Canada after living in refugee camps in Thailand for 2 years. Life was so hard for so long growing up but my mom worked so hard to make sure my brother and I had a childhood full of opportunities and bandwidth to prioritize our education. She gave up so much for us and I'm so glad she's taking advantage of life now to travel the world (obviously not right now) and visit long lost friends who've settled all over the world. 🖤 You deserve the best mama and you are so very loved by everyone who knows you. Thank you for everything you do.
user_15;user_1520.jpg;What a world we live in where I can order vegan cheese curds for delivery?! A bunch of you asked me how I liked these @vegcheese curds, and I have to say, they are very tasty. Very melty and gooey, with a ton of light fluffy texture. It's not like squeaky St Alberts unfortunately, but it's the closest thing I've had to vegan cheese curds! 🖤 Would recommend, they deliver to Ontario and Quebec, and they are local, family run, I believe women-owned and POC-owned 💕
user_15;user_1521.jpg;I got a case of tomato paste from Costco so I decided to use one of the cans to make lentil sloppy joes! I have a lentil sloppy joe recipe on my blog but it's a bit outdated and I make it a little differently now. I can update at some point when I make them again, but play around with the sauce to make it how you like it. 🖤 I used mustard and ketchup for acidity and sweetness, a bit of brown sugar for sweetness and depth, vegan Worcestershire sauce, a touch of soy sauce, garlic powder, onion, salt, pepper, and a bit of pineapple juice for some tangy sweetness! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare

user_15;user_1523.jpg;Made this in my latest videooo 🍕🥐 had a giant can of tomatoes and Eddie wanted pizza sauce!  Currently nursing a caffeine withdrawal headache because I didn't have dalgona coffee today 🤦🏻‍♀️ had some tea and feeling slightly better but OH BOY I will be back on the coffee train I guess 😂  #user_15 #user_15recipes https://youtu.be/3lWYvVGLyi4 (link in bio) #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1524.jpg;#ad As much as I'll never get tired of soups and stews, I've been making open-faced sandwiches for lunch! I used a random can of beans and turned them into a savoury spread (kinda like hummus but chunkier), and topping them with @lightlifefoods smokey tempeh bacon for an extra hit of protein and umami! 🖤 I've been using the smokey tempeh for that smokey savoury hit on my sandwiches and toasts since I first went vegan! I like crisping it up in a pan with bit of oil to top my BLTs, open-faced sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches! In today's open-faced sandwiched, I made a bright and herby bean spread to complement the smokey tempeh, but use whichever beans, herbs, spices and oils you have on hand!: 🖤 1 small onion, diced 1 can (19 fl oz) navy beans 1/2 lemon (~2 tbsp), juiced 1 tbsp olive oil 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp freeze dried dill 1/2 tsp kosher salt 🖤 I cook the onion until lightly browned/caramelized, then toss into a food processor with the beans, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic powder, dill, and salt. Spread it on some bread and top with some pan-fried Lightlife smokey tempeh and you have a tasty lunch that is full of fibre and protein! 🖤 #Lightlife #user_15 #veganfoodshare #thefeedfeed #eeeeeats #cameraeatsfirst #lunchideas #plantbased #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1525.jpg;It was finally nice enough outside for a bike ride! We lasted 15 min then headed home to make dinner 😂 gonna have to rebuild that endurance.
user_15;user_1526.jpg;I've been seeing @itslizmiu rave about these forever and Eddie's been harping on me to stop hoarding frozen rice cakes because it's taking up space in the deep freezer 😬😬 so I finally made these tteokkochi! They're crisped rice cakes slathered in a sweet and spicy gochujang BBQ sauce and wowowow so tasty. 🍢 I cannot wait until I can make these again. So much work but they are a texture bomb that is so good! I'm gonna have to make these for my mom when I can see her again! 🍢 If you want the recipe, go find it on @itslizmiu's website/highlights. She also made it look 10x better than I did here 😅😅 I was slightly hangry and grumpy while cooking this hahaha. Also I deviated from the recipe and kept cooking after I added bbq sauce because it wasnt cooked enough yet haha. 🍢 #user_15 #whatveganseat #quarantinecooking #tteokkochi #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan
user_15;user_1527.jpg;Eddie wanted red onions for burgers but only the bagged ones looked decent while the loose bulk ones were kinda soft at my store. What to do with an abundance of onions?  QUICK PICKLE!  I used 1 part vinegar to 1 part water, a splash of maple syrup, brought to a boil and poured over sliced red onions, some peppercorns, and a couple cloves of garlic. Sandwich and wrap game gonna be 💯  Today I am thankful for having access to fresh produce and the time to preserve it so it doesn't go to waste. We have been so much better about eating what we've got to reduce our food waste and it's been so nice. Definitely something I've been wanting to be better at for a long time and my fridge management skills are definitely not as good as they should be 😂  #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #letscookvegan #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1528.jpg;A couple weeks ago I was so excited to make yogurt with homemade soy milk, and it didn't turn out as horrendously as I feared, it was staunchly OK. I have the stories of this experiment in my highlights if you want to check it out! 🖤 I was super excited to do more experimentation but I noticed that I was reacting to the yogurt and any of the fresh soy products the same way I react to nuts (itchy throat/tongue, hives on my hands) and I was getting kind of stressed out about it. 🖤 As an Asian who grew up eating a ton of soy and as a vegan who relies pretty heavily on soy products because of a nut allergy (that got worse as I went vegan and was eating nuts like no tomorrow lol) I am actually pretty scared. I don't know if I can handle being allergic to both soy AND nuts if this allergy gets worse. 🖤 I've been able to eat tofu and regular store bought soy milks, but I'm getting a miiiild reaction, depending on if I take my antihistamines that day. I'm definitely not looking for advice, I'm just being transparent about why I haven't followed through with all the soy recipes I've been saying I want to do. 🖤 Anyway, that's why I've been a little quiet and my videos have been kind of sparse. I've been sewing and playing animal crossing while waiting for my hives to go away :( hope you are all doing okay! Also I posted a sewing tutorial for the facemasks I've been making on my YouTube if you want to see how I've been making them 🖤 Hope yall are well and doing something that makes you happy ☺️
user_15;user_1529.jpg;Some of you have already been making this dish and I love hearing how much you like it! As I mentioned in the video (link in stories and highlights for ya), this method can be used for other vegan proteins like a fried or baked tofu as well. Especially with @marystestkitchen's double frozen method, dredge and fry that before you toss in the sauce and you will have a DELICIOUS tofu time! 🖤 I haven't tested it with seitan yet, but I imagine you could do the same! Especially with a beefy style, which I have a revamped dope recipe for and need to share with you, as the one I have now is delicious but time consuming. Airfrying or baking the soy curls sound delicious as well, I can't wait to see the results from y'all who try it. 🖤 I'm sewing up a storm of face masks for friends and their family and bingewatching season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race. These queens put my sewing skills to shame 😂 but I am inspired! I have a sewing video coming soon because although it may seem like I know what I'm doing, I only started sewing last year and am so proud of how much I'm improving, project after project! 🖤 Hope you are all having a relaxing weekend and adjusting to our new normal. Thank you for all the love on this recipe, it truly means so much 🥰  #user_15 #user_15recipes #whatveganseat #veganfoodporn #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan https://bit.ly/2XLv3Fe
user_15;user_1530.jpg;It's finally up! This vegan Mongolian beef recipe is the perfect combination of sweet and savoury, with an irresistible texture that requires a certain cooking method to create that epic final dish. 🖤 Big thanks to @yamchopsto for opening up my palate to this dish because I hadn't eaten it since before I was veg (which was 9 years ago!!) if you live in the GTA and can get takeout/delivery from them, I highly recommend their vegan Mongolian beef because I was craving it so hard I had to make it myself 😂 🖤 If you don't live in the GTA and want to make it from home, check our my latest recipe and video, I'll link in the stories/highlights for ya! 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #soycurls https://bit.ly/2KgQxlz
user_15;user_1531.jpg;I really enjoyed filming my chill repotting video and I'm happy that I could give you a relaxing (but still very me) video 🌿  BTW, I am not super good at telling people that my bujo/plant account exists, but if you like following along my planty doodly adventures, my @lisalovesleaves account is where that content lives :) #whatveganslooklike #lisalovesleaves #repotting #plantsplantsplants #houseplantsofinstagram
user_15;user_1532.jpg;I have a lot of feelings about this sauce y'all. Some of you probably don't care about a photo of sauce but I've been working really hard on improving my photography skills with artificial lighting and I'm really proud of this shot. I know it's just sauce but it looks so luscious I'm just really happy with it 🤗 Recipe to be shared soon 🥰
user_15;user_1533.jpg;I bought the wrong kind of potatoes (yellow instead of white) so my potatoes kind of melted into my classic clean-out-the-fridge curry, so the texture was like a thick, more Japanese texture of curry, and Eddie loved it so much he kept getting so excited to eat it 🥰 🖤 Not my most beautiful photo but hey, it is realistic. That was the last of my coconut milk and now it is gonna be added to my grocery list! I'm realizing that we actually go to the grocery store like 2-3x a week when we're not self-isolating so for the past few weeks, I havent been able to feed my whimsical cravings as much 😂 what do you MEAN I need to meal plan?! 🖤 Basically what I've been doing is buying fresh vegetables and fruit and restocking on certain pantry staples I've run out of like cornstarch or coconut milk. And we're almost through our supply of soy curls!! Eddie's put in a giant order of bulk things at @covenhamilton so we can maybe crack open the BBQ now that its a bit nicer outside haha. 🖤 Stay home if you can y'all 🙌 hoping all you extroverts are doing okay haha. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #cookupinlockdown #quarantinecooking
user_15;user_1534.jpg;Got leftover pumpkin puree from the chickpea curry I posted recently? Make some muffins with it! Recipe is live on the blog now :) 🎃 Spring isn't for pumpkins you say? Say that to the giant can of pumpkin puree I had in my pantry for absolutely no reason 😂 🎃 Hope you are all doing well and eating delicious food. I also dropped my vegan mongolian beef recipe on Patreon if anyone wants that. Ho BABY that one is delicious. 🎃 I still need to film the video which is why the recipe isn't live on the blog yet, but I put it up for any of yall who are Wonderful Weirdos because I really appreciate your support during this wild, uncertain time. (No pressure for anyone who doesn't want to or cannot become a patron! Recipe is coming soon to y'all!) 🎃 #user_15 #user_15recipes #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #quarantinecooking #veganbaking https://bit.ly/2Xijsxd
user_15;user_1535.jpg;I can't stop eating melted @fieldroast chao cheese on rice with maggi. Eddie thought it was gross until he tried it and now we keep eating it like every other day 😂 🖤 I'm very thankful we stocked up on the chao cheese before it stopped selling at Costco. Bring it back! I will buy it forever 🙌 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat
user_15;user_1536.jpg;I have been cooking up a storm the past week but I hit a creative block today so my planty video is going to be late. Eddie and I have been eating the heck out of noodles and rice (and obviously these fire noodles, recipe on the blog) and my digestion has been like YO COOL IT WITH THE SPICY FOOD PLS 🖤 So I'm taking a bit of a spicy food break haha, but I will be back. We did another grocery shop the other day since we were out of fresh vegetables and I am honestly shocked at how many people are NOT staying a reasonable distance from each other. Thankfully we've stocked up on produce for the next couple of weeks and will continue to stay home until we absolutely need to go out again. I forgot to get instant coffee to try that whipped coffee and I am so sad that I won't be out to get it until our next shop 😭 🖤 Been sewing, repotting plants (video to come), recipe developing and playing Animal Crossing, and it's been a very good week. Hope you are all staying home if you can and taking care. 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #firenoodles #vegannoodles #sendnoods https://bit.ly/2w8rQ7u
user_15;user_1537.jpg;I haven't really had motivation or energy to do home workouts until this week. I was feeling pretty down about not being able to go to the gym and struggling with the frustration of adapting my routine to home workouts. While I feel very lucky to have had the foresight to buy a workout bench a couple months ago, I am missing the squat rack and barbells in my gym routine. 🖤 After about a two week hiatus from exercise, I'm back at it and it feels good. I'm glad I took a break because I think from my menstrual cycle and dealing with some personal stuff, I needed the physical break to channel my energy into my mental health. Now that things are starting to settle, I'm happy to be picking stuff back up. 🖤 Just a reminder that if anyone else went through a lull like I did, it's important that you know that's ok! Move when it feels good to. I wasn't feeling it, so I didn't. I did have some walks outside with Eddie and a couple bursts of squats while cooking, but not enough energy to dedicate to a rigorous workout, and that is fine. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_1538.jpg;[AD] I shared one of my super lazy favourite lunches with @producemadesimple on their YouTube channel today and it would be amazing if you went and left it some love! Also it's a super easy recipe for lemon pepper soy curls with a quick lil side salad with Ontario Greenhouse tomatoes and cucumber that I use to balance the boldness of lemon pepper! 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #ontariogreenhouse https://bit.ly/2JyDag2
user_15;user_1539.jpg;New vlog on the channel and in it I make my first version of fire noodles! I retested and posted the recipe on my blog and not to toot my own horn but they are pretty dang good! 🔥 Recipe is on the blog, I'll link it in my stories! 🔥 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #firenoodles https://bit.ly/2w8rQ7u
user_15;user_1540.jpg;Got soy curls? Some vegan mayo (or aquafaba to make mayo?)? Seaweed? And rice? Make yoself some onigiri and chow haha. It's perfect fuel for a long walk or a fun hands on dinner that people can make for themselves! 🍙 Recipe is on TheVietVegan.com and video is up on the YouTubes! Hope your Monday is going well! Today I sold 38 tarantulas and paid off the 758k loan on my house in #ACNH. My house is made of spiders 😬 🍙 Today is another edit day but I'll probably be experimenting again in the kitchen with some Mongolian Soy Curls because the ones I had from @yamchopsto were straight fire and I need that all the way out in Hamilton haha. 🍙 #user_15recipes #user_15 #onigiri #veganfoodshare #cookupinlockdown #quarantinecooking https://bit.ly/3agfFEw
user_15;user_1541.jpg;One of my new favourite pantry cook ups: 30 min pumpkin chickpea curry! Just posted this video on my channel and I am probably gonna cook up some more of this because I have another can of chickpeas left! 🖤 After this I'll have to start cooking up my dried beans, which means it's time to soak some beans. Hope you are having a relaxing Sunday and that you got some #ACNH turnips at a good price today 😂 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #cookupinlockdown #pantrycooking #quarantinecooking https://bit.ly/3avE74I
user_15;user_1542.jpg;I'm missing in person hangs with Janelle and cooking delicious food together for our channels 😭 we have so many ideas for our next cooking adventures but obviously those will have to wait, so in the meantime, please check out our most recent video with Vietnamese style Hot Pot!! Janelle has a 50 min long mukbang on her channel that y'all have been really enjoying and it's so heartwarming to see you all supporting her new channel. You are all truly the best! 🖤 Check out our videos on YouTube, I'll link mine in the bio and on my stories 🍲 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #vietnamesehotpot #lau #hotpot https://bit.ly/2yhkEqf
user_15;user_1543.jpg;Honestly I'm kind of astounded we're not sick of each other after this many days stuck in the house together 😂 no current picture of us because we basically look like the second picture right now ahahah. But here's one where we cleaned up pretty good! Eddie bought another switch so he could also play #animalcrossingnewhorizons on his own island. It's been pretty hilarious. 🖤 We also have watched all of Picard (I liked it but it's not very traditional Star Trek, which is fine), a bunch of random movies, and eaten an impressive amount of food. Today is an editing day but I'll be filming a pantry curry in a bit! Although everyone seems to be making curry so I'm not sure that's even helpful to you, but oh well! Eddie's been craving curry all week so that's what we'll be cooking up 😂 🖤 Today I gave my desk a much needed tidy and clear off (my vanity and bookshelf beside me is next on that list) and my next project is repotting my very angry rootbound plants lol. Maybe I'll film a chill video for that. And maybe that long requested plant tour yall have been asking for. 🖤 What are you cooking up today? Anyone making cool cooking projects like fermenting or sourdough? Some folks from my discord are making tofu and it's so cool! 📸: @codyturnerphoto
user_15;user_1544.jpg;As someone who spends a lot of time working home alone, it has been an adjustment to not be distracted by Eddie working from home 😅 I've never been good at changing routine, and I hear a lot of you have been adjusting as well. 🖤 A bunch of you have asked for more pantry staple recipes and I've had to eat through my fridge (from recipe testing) before I can cook up more food to put in there. But rest assured I'll have to dip into my dry and bulk goods this week! Eddie is delighted to be actually be able to see the back of the fridge and freezer 😂 🖤 In the meantime, keeping my lazy self fed with this Mongolian 'Beef' that @yamchopsto sent me! Super delicious and very easy to just heat up. Eddie's going to enjoy the other half of the package of this one I suspect :) Turns out YamChops does delivery (you can check out the details on their page, not exactly sure how things are working out now with the new updates). It's super awesome that they are providing vegan goodness for everyone they can during this time. Eating the last of my snow pea tips and I am very sad about it. They are so tasty 😭 🖤 Hope everyone is doing well and taking care. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshares #yamchops (not sponsored, they just sent them to me with no strings so I can try their stuff! I already know it's all delicious though ahaha)
user_15;user_1545.jpg;Feeling explorative in the kitchen (these quasi dan dan noods from my story) while trying to burn through this ebook before I have to return it to @hamiltonlibrary 😅😅😅 i think there is only one copy of Becoming and 15 people waiting for it (which explains why I only just got it this week when I placed a hold on it back in SEPTEMBER). 🖤 A lot of y'all have been asking for pantry staple type cooking and while I have some of those dishes in my queue, I really just want hot spicy noods right now and I gotta follow my heart 😅 but I have TONS of pantry style cooking recipes on my blog because y'all, thats how I cook normally haha. I am not a meal planner. I open the fridge and go 'hmmm what is going bad and needs to be cooked?' or 'I HAVE NOTHING IN THE FRIDGE what can I do with mayo and chickpeas 😂 🖤 Don't be shy to click around on my blog, peruse my visual recipe index and see what you've got. I always do my best to only use ingredients that most people have or have access to, but you can substitute stuff within reason to cater to your pantry! Feel free to DM me for sub questions, I understand not wanting to buy specific ingredients. Heck I even DM'd @marystestkitchen for a black vinegar sub yesterday and she was gracious enough to answer haha. 🖤 Hope you are all cooking up some good good with what you've got! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #dandannoodles
user_15;user_1546.jpg;I worked on a vegan shoot recently (my freelance work and not as TVV) and I got to take home so many goodies from the shoot. Sunflower shoots and alfalfa sprouts are so delicious and I always forget how much I like them. 🖤 I made these taco-sized wraps of @gardein fishless filets (my last of my stockpile from the last sale) and a mound of romaine lettuce and sprouts. Topped with my delicious tahini sriracha sauce from my lentil patty recipe. 🖤 I have some seeds in my cupboards somewhere and I think I'll start sprouting them with my mesh lid and a jar. So easy and tasty fresh nutrition with only a couple days of quick rinsing! 🖤 New video incoming today! It's going live as soon as I get out of bed 😅😅 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #fridgecleanout
user_15;user_1547.jpg;Today I am writing a list of pantry staples and fridge contents and going to play around. Maybe film a recipe today with those delicious ingredients. Maybe edit one of the videos that I filmed a couple weekends ago with Janelle (but it seems inappropriate to show an abundance of shopping around a stocked grocery store from a few weeks ago). This Onigiri being one of those videos🍙 🖤 Today I am going to clean and listen to #becomingmichelleobama because I waited 6 months for this audiobook from @hamiltonlibrary 😂 Today I am consciously taking time to breathe and feel my feelings. And today I may stream some #oriandthewillofthewisps because Ori and the Blind Forest was one of my favourite games or all time. 🖤 Today I am going to forgive myself if I cannot do all the things, but simply feel good that I am healthy. Thankful that I am privileged enough to be able to afford our mortgage payments, and lucky enough to already work from home. Today I am thankful and trying to focus on the positive. 🖤 What are you up to today?
user_15;user_1548.jpg;From Friday: Ramen with friends, supporting @mystic.ramen and the @hamontmarket while I still can! My friend got the tantanmen (first pic) which is my usual go-to while I branched out and got the spicy curry miso this time! It was very delicious but I still prefer the tantanmen 😅 Post-ramen hiking with friends has been fun and a good way to get outside. Gotta love squelchy mud and cronchy leaves! 🖤 I have some upcoming recipes with some specialty ingredients but I also have been having to cook a lot from my pantry staples and fridge remnants. I'm thinking I'll do a couple videos on that if you're down to experiment along with me, but if you wanna leave some of your pantry staples down below, if I have some of the same ones I can play around in the kitchen to maybe inspire you to do something new from what you have. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #hamiltonfarmersmarket #hamiltonvegan #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1549.jpg;Lately I've been trying to focus my energy on what makes me happy because so much is being thrown at me in my life and I am having a hard time functioning as a human. But the outdoors and trees consistently make me feel good, so I've been pouring my energy into going outside. 🖤 As someone who works from home, I am really lucky to already have many of my systems in place to work and get paid, although with everything that's been going on, I'm not really sure if new and somewhat complicated recipes (at least recipes that people don't typically have the ingredients in their pantry for) will be very helpful to anyone. It feels odd creating light-hearted content I filmed a couple weeks ago. 🖤 I feel uneasy and uncomfortable, and as someone who struggles with not being in control of my destiny and the things that happen around me, I feel anxious about the future. So outside I go, to the trees and the muddy paths that don't do anything other than be what they are. I am in charge of my own path in the woods, or at least the path that has been carved before me. 🖤 So focusing on just what's ahead and prioritizing positive things and time with people I love have been helpful. But as with what's been going on in the world on top of the happenstances in my life, it's a wait and see sort of situation. 🖤 Hope you are all having delicious days and finding happiness. 📸: @janellecarpenter
user_15;user_1550.jpg;This week has been a scary and overwhelming week for everyone. This week I saw lots of people I love and had fun hanging out while practicing good hand washing hygiene. Anyone who has eaten with me knows I've always been intense about washing my hands, so I am extra preachy with my friends about it now 😂 🖤 We went to Muya Restaurant, my favourite Ethiopian restaurant (possibly ever) and ate lots of delicious stew and injera, but after a few days of eating out and tackling family things, I'll be hunkering down and self-isolating for a while. I've gotten sick from my gym before so I don't feel super comfortable going there during this time where we need to be vigilant with not touching our faces and staying home when we feel sick. 🖤 Eddie has a couple sets of weights and we recently bought a workout bench so I'll have to modify my workouts and just do them from home for the time being. It's sucky but we all gotta do our best to flatten the curve to give our healthcare system a fighting chance to work on containing COVID and protecting our immune-compromised community members. 🖤 Sending love and good health to everyone out there. Stay safe, do what you are able to do but remember that this is a really rough time for small businesses who already have razor-thin margins as it is. Consume reputable media (rely on medical experts plz) 🖤 Call out racist BS if you see it (as an Asian woman, it is a scary time to be out and about in this rather xenophobic era). DON'T buy in bulk-you do not need a years worth of TP, simply stock up (as you normally would, nothing too wild) on pantry staples like beans, rice, pasta, pasta sauce, frozen veggies and fruit etc! It's a good time to eat your fridge and pantry clean (like we've been working hard to do!) 🖤 #user_15 #covid_19
user_15;user_1551.jpg;The recipe is now live over on my channel! This is bánh bột chiên chay, traditionally made with eggs, this is steamed rice cake thats sliced into cubes, fried until nice and crispy, then cooked together with a couple eggs, topped with lightly cooked green onions, and doused in a soy-based sauce. 🖤 I obviously don't use eggs here, and I had made a specific trip to Buffalo to make sure I got a bunch of @eatjust Egg to be able to make this! You can also use @followyourheart Vegan Egg but I think that JustEgg cooks up a bit faster for this purpose. 🖤 My memories of eating this dish growing up included hearing the sounds of motorbikes honking and whizzing by while squat-sitting on those tiny plastic chairs that should be for kids and spearing these hot, crisp and chewy chunks with that specific tiny spear they give you to eat with. What a delicious dish and I am so happy to be able to eat a vegan version of it! 🖤 As always, link to the recipe will be in the bio feed link (it might take a bit to populate) but in the meantime you can swipe up for the video and recipe in my stories 🕺 🖤 #user_15 #user_15recipes #veganfoodshare #veganstreetfood #botchien #whatveganseat http://bit.ly/3aLcl3S
user_15;user_1552.jpg;My patrons saw this lil sneak peek last week but this is for you late nighters who want a midnight treat for the eyes 😘 recipe coming tomorrow! I finally was able to edit the video and I just need to write the recipe out on the blog before it goes live. 🖤 Anyone familiar with this one? It's a classic Vietnamese breakfast that I ate street food style a lot growing up! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #vietnamesefood #vietvegan
user_15;user_1553.jpg;It's always a good time when there are this many goodies prepped 😁😁 Filmed the video that had all this veggie goodness yesterday, I'm excited to share this one with you!  #user_15 #whatveganseat #eatmoreproduce #producemadesimple
user_15;user_1554.jpg;My weekend in photos 🍩🥐🌲❄️ it was a very tiring but fun weekend. Got some heavy stuff coming for the next little while and there's nothing to do except just ride it out, but it's a slow and steady train. I'm just going to try to carry on and take breaks when I have to.  If you haven't had a chance to try @mmmdonuts.ca yet, the next time you find yourself in Barrie, definitely get yourself some donuts! Most are made with almond milk but they had three that were almond-free and luckily my favourite flavour anyway (mapleeee) so fluffy and yummy! Very similar to Bloomer's 🙌  #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #barrieontario
user_15;user_1555.jpg;This week started off with such amazing energy and productivity, and then slowly devolved into a hot mess. Taking some time to just deal with the cards I got dealt and spend some time with family. I really tried to get a video out for tomorrow but the last two days have been so dry of creativity that I didn't want to put out a poopy video when I am actually so excited to share this recipe. 🖤 I have a lot of stuff in store for this weekend though so hopefully I can convert this sensitive/moody time into some personal growth and good content for y'all 🙈 🖤 📸: @janellecarpenter 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike #royalbotanicgardens
user_15;user_1556.jpg;[AD] These gyoza babies are finally live over on @producemadesimple! Stuffed with tons of veggies and a vegan ground meat alternative for an unctuous and savoury delight, you can find the recipe over on ProduceMadeSimple.ca and watch the epic foodpr0n over on their YouTube channel. 🥟 Always so grateful to be a part of this campaign and educating people about different ways to enjoy produce (as much as I love roasted veggies, I will take dumplings as my vessel of veggies any day!) 🥟 I'll leave a link over in my stories for the recipe and the video!

user_15;user_1557.jpg;It's yucky outside and all I want is ramen.

user_15;user_1558.jpg;Today I went to the gym, hit a new PR, got complimented on my gold/blue eye look by a cashier, peeped orchids with @janellecarpenter at @rbgcanada, took some cute photos, and ate some delicious food 🍜. Now I'm editing videos and cozied up with a blanket 🥰 🖤 It's been an eventful and energizing weekend, and I'm ready to hit this week with good energy and a happy belly. I've been so happy with the feedback about the adobo recipe video, and I have so many plans for content and recipes this year! Can't wait to share em with you soon 😁 🖤 For those wondering, this is the rendang and the laksa from Little Asia in Dundas. We also got tempeh satay because they do some wicked sorcery to make it wildly tasty but my photo of it was not very nice do you'll just have to imagine it. Hope you all had a wonderful weekend! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #dundasontario #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #feedfeedvegan
user_15;user_1559.jpg;🇵🇭 It's finally here! Vegan adobo!! I'm so excited to share this recipe 🤗 I hadn't ever tried adobo before so I really couldn't have done it without @janellecarpenter's guidance. 🖤 This dish is super bold in flavour and is super easy to make. I again used @kingsvegetarian soy roasted bites AND their drumsticks to make this recipe but I found the soy roasted bites yielded a much better adobo. 🖤 I also have a stovetop AND @instantpotofficial version on the blog, so I'll leave a link in the bio and stories for you to go to. Go watch the video to see me and Janelle with some funny nap energy and chatting a bit about our cultures 🤗 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganadobo #adobo #veganfilipino http://bit.ly/2I70LUv
user_15;user_1560.jpg;🇵🇭 New Filipino recipe on the channel: Vegan Sinigang! Typically made with pork, I used @kingsvegetarian roasted soy bites, tamarind paste, okra, long beans, eddo, and daikon! So much deliciousness in one bowl and it is such a hit of savoury tangy flavour, Sinigang is such a good time. 🖤 Of course my video has the wonderful guidance of @janellecarpenter and her mom's advice for this recipe! Always thankful to have you being a part of this series and exploring your roots via cooking with me 😁 🖤 Recipe linked in the description, swipe up in stories for a link to the video (or recipe!) 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #feedfeedvegan #sinigang #veganfilipino #filipino http://bit.ly/2uzvXbS
user_15;user_1561.jpg;(CW body image, food talk, disordered eating history) I need to work on my selfie poses but I thought it would be good to document my body and my mindset at this point! 🖤 It's been about 8 months of me working out 2-4x a week while dealing with the chaos of family gatherings, grief, holidays, and extremely busy moments. I've done my best to simply move when it feels good to, and rest when it doesn't. When I go to the gym on a lazy or bleh day, I might not be lifting as well or as heavy as I'd like, but I always feel better after. 🖤 The benefits of regular exercise has been confidence, a better relationship with my body, a more conscious effort to eat regularly and well, and better focus. The impact on my productivity before and after adding activity to my routine has been an huge improvement in my ability to focus and my overall happiness. I never understood why people liked activity or the gym before and welp, folks, I get it now. 🖤 I still eat mostly whatever I feel like eating, but honestly my cravings have changed a lot over the past few months. Yes, I still love eating at restaurants and I will never not want McDonald's french fries, but I find myself reaching for fruit or eating meals at home a lot more than I used to. Obviously this doesn't stop me from eating birthday cake cereal and fruit roll ups (RE: my last WIEIAD video) but I've been making a really conscious effort to appreciate my hunger cues and eat when it feels good to. This wasn't always something that was possible for me and I am thankful my body found its rhythm again. 🖤 I have noticed that I can get really triggered by before and after photos I see from fitness subreddits. I can also get really triggered by seeing people employ extreme tactics to curb their hunger or overexert themselves physically for weight loss. I have done a lot of work to find the line between being excited with my progress in the gym and being careful not to get obsessed with the numbers or the food intake. 🖤 It's been a long road but I am happy and feeling strong. I never thought I could be like this. I hope you find ways to move that make you feel good too. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike

user_15;user_1563.jpg;Cleaning out my fridge with a stir fry/sorry attempt at char kway teow! I didn't use the right noodles because I only had wide wheat noodles, but I used a combination of dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), and vegan oyster sauce I found at B&Ts in Kitchener. 🖤 This one had puffy tofu, baby bok choy, Taiwanese cabbage, vegan shrimp, and green onion, and it was a decent second try (my first try was ages ago and I can't find those recipe notes) I think I needed more soy sauce and some vegan fried egg business (either tofu or @eatjust egg) but overall it was a very tasty way to clean out the fridge 🤤 I still have half of the Taiwanese cabbage I bought like 2 weeks ago but she's still going strong so I'm gonna keep using her up while I can. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #charkwayteow #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan

user_15;user_1565.jpg;(ad) One of the recipes I made with @producemadesimple this year is this super simple potato fried rice! I learned about it from @mommytang and it's become one of my favourite dishes to eat when I have day old rice and some Ontario potatoes and onion! 🖤 My obsession with knife skills make this dish super easy to prepare, and it's a great opportunity for y'all to practice that Brunoise fine dice technique! I really want to find a hardy vegetable cleaver because I've been watching @streetfoodnetflix and I've been so enamoured with their incredibly quick and precise knife skills. 🖤 The recipe for this potato fried rice with a spicy gochujang and ketchup drizzle is up on ProduceMadeSimple.ca and on their YouTube channel! I'll leave ya a link in the bio and stories 🥰 please check it out if you don't know about them already!

HOLY HECATE IT WAS SO GOOD. 🖤 I was not expecting to love it so much. That is one of my new favourite dishes, especially since their winter menu doesn't have my favourite jerk seitan bowl. So now I have a winter go-to 🤗 🖤 Today is a holiday here in Canada, but Eddie is working so now I'm just chillin at home and cleaning.

Stay tuned for some fun stories later I'm sure 😂 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare http://bit.ly/2uKRtdD
user_15;user_1572.jpg;#ad I've been experimenting with this wonton soup for a while and I'm so excited to finally share it with you! I used @LightlifeFoods Plant-Based Ground to create the PERFECT wonton filling! It cooks up so nicely and binds together with carrot, cabbage, water chestnut, and onion so well. PLUS it yields the same nostalgic tender bite that I love. 🖤 Full recipe is live on TheVietVegan and I'll put swipe up links in stories and a link in the bio for you! I hope you love it and can make it! 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #lightlife #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #lunarnewyear #wontonsoup http://bit.ly/2Gh5odz
user_15;user_1573.jpg;Sometimes you just gotta shove a crispy rice ball in your mouth because you gave up a little 😂 also another day of posting a picture that both ruins and maintains my feed aesthetic at the same time💃 🖤 Y'all who saw my last video know what happened here 🙈
user_15;user_1574.jpg;Hi, my name is Lisa, and I always put too much in the pot for soup 😬 🖤 Cleaning out the fridge with some canh chua today! I have a very simplified version of this on the @producemadesimple site (ad not not really? It's an old recipe I developed for them but I am also currently a brand ambassador) so I'll be developing a more current version of the recipe soon, this is just me experimenting with jarred tamarind paste instead of using the paste with seeds in it. Turns out it's not as good with the paste (it's definitely easier, just not as sour) 🖤 In this pot we have some tomatoes, okra, mushrooms, baby bok choy, onions, some tofu and vegan shrimp! I only wish I had some pineapple. All very tasty and super veggie-ful! I'll have to eat this over the next couple days because I don't think Eddie is much of a fan of this soup haha. Its a sour and savoury soup and it's a childhood favourite! 🖤 If you want the simplified recipe, I'll link it in stories and in my bio (sometimes it takes a bit to repopulate in the website feed) http://bit.ly/37dtEbG #user_15 #user_15recipes #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #canhchua #eatmoreproduce #producemadesimple
user_15;user_1575.jpg;I had a lot of fun filming and editing this cookbook review for #livbsveganonabudget and I actually totally learned that seitan her way is delicious! Eddie really liked this sliceable seitan I made from her book. Have you seen my cookbook review yet? I'll link it in my bio and stories for ya in case you missed it. 🖤 I have a second copy of the cookbook that I'd love to giveaway to anyone in the US/Canada! To enter make sure you're following me (so I can DM you if you win) and just comment down below what recipe you wanted to try from her cookbook! I tried 4.5 recipes from her book in my video if you wanna see what I tried out :) be sure to follow @itslivb to see more of her beautiful self and delicious creations. 🖤 Giveaway will be open until Feb 14, this giveaway is not affiliated with Instagram or any other platform. I just have an extra copy of the book I wanna share with yall haha. 🖤 #user_15 #user_15recipes (not my recipe this is just how I get the link in my bio lol) http://bit.ly/2uzEYl9
user_15;user_1576.jpg;Noodles & squishy Edward face 😍 I always recommend @saigonlotustoronto for delicious vegan bún bò Huế and phổ! I don't know how they get their broth so savoury and sweet. TELL ME YOUR SECRETS! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #vegansoftoronto
user_15;user_1577.jpg;(AD) My competitive nature and teacher's tendencies came out in full force last night at the Ontario apple-full cook off event with @producemadesimple last night and WOW never has my obsession with knife skills and cooking technique been so useful LOL. 🖤 We were split into two teams and my team had a fairly French dish: an Empire apple white bean puree, a sweet potato, butternut squash and Fuji apple hash, a warm winter frisee and radicchio salad with a McIntosh vinaigrette, and caramelized fennel and onions with Ambrosia apples. The meat eaters had chicken, while the veggies had a quinoa, sweet potato and black bean patty. 🖤 The other team had roasted carrots and apples, an apple and radish slaw, with a sweet potato (and apple?) puree and THE MOST DELECTABLE savoury fried apple chip on top. Holy moly. This dish won (😭 I'm not sore, I swear) and it was so delicious. So many ways to use apples, and most of the food was vegan which was so nice to be able to eat like 80% of everything! 🖤 It was such a fun night of cooking with amazing foodies and creative people! I'm so excited to be a brand ambassador again this year for @producemadesimple because you know me and how much I love to hype fruits and veggies and showing you delicious ways to incorporate more produce in your life. Stay tuned for some fun recipes over on @producemadesimple! 🖤 #user_15 #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #onappleaday @ontarioapples
user_15;user_1578.jpg;Are you the type who always tries something new on the menu? Or are you the kind of person that falls in love with one specific dish and almost never strays from it because it's the only thing you crave when you go there? 🖤 I'm the latter 😂 but at @soostoronto (and their vegan @fatchoito items), basically everything thing is delicious. Honestly though, my favourite items from them are their okonomiyaki, oyster mushroom lettuce wraps, laksa, and my absolute favourite noodle dish: char kway teow 🤤 🖤 It's ALWAYS a good time. Especially with their sago sago and their deep fried banana to end off the meal with a sweet note 😍 forever a fangirl for Soos! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #torontovegan #vegansofinstagram
user_15;user_1579.jpg;February! The month of loOoOove 💘ahaha, jk, but in all seriousness, I'm feeling thankful for this grumpy hunk 🥰 we've been together for almost 5 years now and we are still learning new things about each other because surprise, surprise, people will always grow and change as time goes on, and that is normal to feel growing pains in a couple. 🖤 Eddie was the first person who accepted all of me and who I was and embraced it all. We are both flawed humans and we don't shy away from our faults, but rather than shine a light on them, we just accept they exist and work on being better. Nobody is perfect and we're just doing our best. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike #vegancouple
user_15;user_1580.jpg;I am always thankful that my omni friends are down to chow down on vegan food with me 🥰 🖤 This beauty is the unchicken burger from @hogtownvegan with the fries supremacy! The ultimate combo 🍔🍟 🖤 Been feeling pretty burnt out lately, the mini break from posting on IG has been nice but honestly I just like oversharing with you guys 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #torontovegan #vegansoftoronto
user_15;user_1581.jpg;Eddie has caught my cold from last week, and so we are eyeing up this garlic ramen from @ramenisshin again 🍜 but we're trying to be more frugal and stop eating out so much 😞 🖤 I ordered the garlic ramen and Eddie had the spicy miso ramen. I had kale noodles because the regular noodles aren't vegan, while Eddie had rice noodles. So good! Probably my favourite vegan ramen in the city right now 🤤 🖤 #user_15 #veganramen #torontovegan #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1582.jpg;Last week it suddenly dawned on me that we are so lucky to have access to so many herbs and spices! Fragrant spices and herbs fill our homes with scents that bring us to places around the world! Even simple ones we take for granted, salt, pepper, and vanilla? What would any dishes be without salt? Cake without vanilla? 🖤 Cherish the spices you have! Explore new ones you've never tried before! Use them generously and enjoy them fully. We are so lucky to know how to cook with them and have access to so many 🥰
user_15;user_1583.jpg;Lately I've been in the mood for RICE and lemon pepper..? I had all these plans and a special video slated for today but then I freaking got sick and was down for the count for a couple days. Luckily it only seems to be a shortlived head cold and not whatever it was in December that knocked me out for 2 weeks! 🖤 Today is the first day of the year of the rat! I'm going to be working a bit today before I head over for family festivities, but I thought I'd pop in and show you what I've been eating lately. My last two dinners have been a beyond burger, steamed rice, a slice of that alternative kitchen cheese I found (in my last grocery haul) that we've been struggling to work through and some sauteed spinach and mushroom. With LOTS of lemon pepper. Like probably too much but I don't care. 🖤 I don't know what it is but this dinner has been totally hitting the spot! Last night I had the same thing but with buttered peas and corn instead of the sauteed veggies. I kind of love it but its like the WASPiest meal I've ever made in my life lol. 🖤 Just polished off the last of my wonton soup (recipe I beliiieeeve is going to be up next week, just pending sponsor approval) and I cannot wait to share it with you. It's been so soothing on my throat in the peak of my cold and I am sad that I've eaten it all :( 🖤 Anyway, happy new year friends! May the year of the rat bring you good fortune and good health! This is my first new year's as a married person so I give red envelopes instead of getting them now haha. 🖤 #user_15 #lunarnewyear #tet #chucmungnammoi
user_15;user_1584.jpg;I have become obsessed with dumplings. Anything that can be made into a filling I want to put it inside a dumpling. Right now I'm just finishing up this wonton recipe and I hopefully can have it up tomorrow if all things go according to plan! 🖤 I didn't plan ahead enough for new year's, so I don't have a Vietnamese specific recipe for Tet, but I will be eating tons of vegan Vietnamese food this weekend with the famjam! Anybody else celebrating Lunar New Year? How are you celebrating? 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganwonton #vegandumplings
user_15;user_1585.jpg;I seriously cannot get enough of these overalls and the pockets have been life-changing. I need more overalls. Sure, I look like I'm 10, but with scrunchies and crop tops coming back, its a whole aesthetic that I'm living for, ok?! 🖤 Back to the editing grind today, I'm pretty excited for the content that's coming up, and Janelle and I have finalized what we're cooking up for our next Filipino videos... Any guesses?! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_1586.jpg;I finally got a chance to try out @thecoldpressery in Mississauga after moving away (even though I lived there for 4 years 😅) I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup with a latte and I have to admit, I was disappointed. 🖤 Not disappointed in the food, the grilled cheese was delicious (and I recognize that luscious high fibre loaf from @cobsbread anywhere) and the tomato soup was tasty, but everything was in to-go cups, even after they asked if I was eating in. Had I known this was practice, I would have given them my containers to fill up. Luckily I had my cutlery with me, otherwise I would have used their disposable cutlery that was wrapped in plastic. 🖤 It's 2020 y'all, the world is swimming in garbage and is literally on fire. I know it's extra cost to have dishes, labour, a dishwasher, and maintain that business model, but convenience is costing our planet. I am floored whenever vegan businesses don't adopt more sustainable practices. We can't all be perfect (I am by no means zero-waste), but c'mon. We can do better.
user_15;user_1587.jpg;Find you some friends who will eat all the things and laugh as loud as you in public 🥰  #user_15 #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #southindiandosamahal #dosa #torontovegan
user_15;user_1588.jpg;Been really leaning into the chaotic energy all week and I am finally feeling pretty chill and calm today instead of hyper and weird. This week we mealprepped some taco filling (@yvesveggiecuisine ground from Costco!) And I fried some rice up with garlic and cilantro and heated up some canned refried beans. Yuuuum. 🖤 Been treating myself with some skincare and a day off today after a few days of hustlin and editing. I've actually got my video for tomorrow scheduled and this weekend I'll be editing Wednesdays! I'm doing my best to be a little more ahead and not totally procrastinate my life 😂 🖤 Hope you are all having a delicious day! #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1589.jpg;Yesterday I posted my spicy vegan chicken salad but I also have a classic chicken salad for any of y'all who can't handle the heat! 🖤 The spicy version isn't even really that spicy, but then again, I've been eating sriracha on everything since I was 3 so my tastebuds are used to being singed off lol. 🖤 Recipe in stories, bio, and linked in my latest YouTube video! http://bit.ly/375HlKJ #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganmealprep #plantbasedmealprep #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1590.jpg;My spicy vegan chicken salad recipe & video is now live! I was probably a little hungry because I had some super chaotic energy in it haha. Editing it was a combination of cringe and just laughing at myself, but y'all seem to enjoy it so it's worth the cringe! 🖤 I'll leave some swipe ups in my stories for the recipe & video, and a link in the bio for the recipe! It's the perfect recipe for meal prep and easy lunches, so definitely give it a try!

user_15;user_1591.jpg;Ruining yet also somehow maintaining the aesthetic of my IG feed in 3...2...1 😂  Just a sneak peek to tomorrow's video. I was stuck on what photo to post next because I don't have any pictures of me I like right now so here's one to make you laugh 👍
user_15;user_1592.jpg;Turns out, I really enjoy folding dumplings. I always wanted to try folding dumplings this way, it's just like folding a traditional dumpling, but instead of five pleats, I did 8-9 all in the same direction and then tucked the corners together to make a circle. So cute! Although I think for the wonton soup recipe I'm making, it'll be the traditional easy tortellini-like fold with the square wrappers instead. 🖤 Recipe coming soon! Low key just want to make like a 20 min video of dumpling folding 😂 dumpling mukbang? Dumpling foldbang? Mukfold? I'll stop. #user_15 #vegandumplings #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan
user_15;user_1593.jpg;✨TOFU RICOTTA STUFFED SHELLS✨  The recipe and very chaotic video is live on the channel and y'all seemed to enjoy how weird I was 😂 I'm glad sitting through that footage to edit myself for hours was worth it because y'all it is so hard to watch that over and over LOL 🖤 High in protein, high in FUNKY flavour and easy peasy. (And cheap cause yo girl is frugal AF rn lol) Recipe is live on the blog and video is on ze channel!

user_15;user_1594.jpg;Get you some friends who will hype you up at the gym and then cook you dope AF vegan food. This past year I have been eating SO good with friends who have been vegan and non-vegan who cook as their love language and it is a good time! 🖤 My friend made the chipotle sausage lentil stew from @rainbowplantlife's vegan instant pot cookbook and y'all that was probably the best stew in my LIFE. I think I shall be adding that cookbook to my wishlist! This is the year I actually work through my long list of cookbook reviews haha. 🖤 I actually love cookbooks so much, I love looking at the photos, reading recipes, and seeing snippets of people's lives through the head notes of recipes. Food is love, food is nostalgia, and reading about what makes a person remember this or that is so fascinating. 🖤 Hopefully one day I can manifest my own cookbook, but for now, I just gotta keep on keeping on 👍 #user_15 #rainbowplantlife #veganinstantpot
user_15;user_1595.jpg;The best sandwich is the bánh mì sandwich. I always get a little annoyed when people take this sandwich and westernize it completely: putting it on French baguette which is too stiff, chewy, and hard for the delicate ingredients inside. I always see jalapenos on the westernized ones and I am side-eyeing like, y'all its bird's eye chili or nothing lol. 🖤 I'm always excited for people to experience Vietnamese food, but nowadays if theres pickled carrot on a baguette with whatever else inside they call it a bánh mì. 🤦🏻‍♀️ In any case, bánh mì is the perfect lunch. You can find them at most Vietnamese sandwich shops with a vegetarian option (lemongrass tofu is typical) that you can veganize when you ask for no mayo and no pate. They should run you $3 per sandwich, and if it costs more, you're probably getting bamboozled lol. 🖤 This one was from Dai Bi Chay and was the perfect appetizer before my dosa dinner later that night. Sometimes you gotta take advantage of being in the city and hit up as many friends as you can haha. 🖤 I have a couple recipes on my blog for banh mi components: do chua, pate, and a tofu curd (yuba) sandwich you can find on user_15.com :) thank you for listening to my little rant 😅 I'm sure it happens to a lot of cultural foods. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #daibichay #vietnamesefood #banhmi #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_1596.jpg;You are all so wonderful and I am floored by the support from my last post. I have always been one to return hate with heart, and I always have a good laugh about the absurd comments I get. Who has the time?! But I am grateful for all your words of encouragement and I feel seen and heard by you, and for that, I thank you. 🖤 2020 is the year I embrace New Year's Resolutions: to rekindle old friendships while also making time for new ones. Last night I had shared a delicious meal with @veganinyourcity and @torontoveganmom, both amazing vegan women who are intersectional, badass parents, and always willing to lend their voice to speak up for those who are not as easily heard. 🖤 South Indian Dosa Mahal is beautiful, flavourful, and very vegan friendly, so if you need dosa in the city, I highly recommend eating there. They have multiple locations but the one I went to was in Roncesvalles. 🖤 I'll probably do another post on some other NY Resolutions I have, but this is all you get today. I am going to be late with my video today but that's ok. You'll probably get it tomorrow night. Hope you are having a wonderful weekend! 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #torontovegan #veganfoodshare #southindiandosamahal #dosa
user_15;user_1597.jpg;I've been getting a lot of negative comments on YouTube lately: people calling me fat, pointing out my acne and my belly, saying I look like a dude... The list goes on. But honestly? I've literally never been happier with my body. And I think my happiness and the fact that I can do a video completely without makeup offends them and that is hilarious to me. 🖤 For the first time in my life, I love my broad shoulders. They mean that my goal to doing an unassisted pull-up is marginally easier. I love my muscular legs now, because I can see week by week, how much stronger I can squat and deadlift. I even love my calves, because they are so strong. 🖤 I don't love my acne but I know it's temporary. My menstrual cycle just started and the week before, I always break out with a few spots. But acne doesn't define me, everyone gets acne and it's just a part of life. 🖤 Comments on my appearance and my body used to shake me, and this whole body acceptance and fitness journey has rocked my world and my perception of myself. I am pumped to hit the gym and see how much I can lift, I am so excited by how my body is changing, and I am loving how hungry I am (although right now I am snackless and quite hungry). 🖤 It's been a bit of a journey, but at 29, I truly can say I love my body. I never thought I would be able to love all the parts that made me the wrong fit for ballet or the opposite of a dainty Asian build. But here we are and it's damn cool. So for all them haters who seem to be offended by my body, I hope you learn to love yourself too. Because it's pretty great. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike #vegansofinstagram #veganswholift
user_15;user_1598.jpg;Vegan couple hangs and vegan pizza with doggo frens. Best way to start the new year! We used @hotforfood dough recipe (but split into 4 dough balls instead of 2 for that good good thin crust), topped with pizza sauce made with an unmeasured amount of tomato paste, spices, and balsamic vinegar, @followyourheart mozzarella, @fieldroast sausage and the juiciest pineapple! 🍕 I've been so lucky to find and befriend more vegan couple friends over the past few years and it's been so cool! Also finding a lifting buddy has been fun because our hangs include gym and food and lately those have been two of my favourite things! (Gym is my favourite? Wtf who am I?) 🍕 I am floored by the feedback of my latest video (10 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Went Vegan), and it's prompted some good conversation in the comments as well. Thank you everyone who's watched and commented. I've just went ahead and deleted some trolly comments because I just don't feel like feeding the trolls today, so if you see em, just ignore them. 🍕 I'll leave a link in the bio for anyone who wants to watch and I have a bunch of comments to answer when I get back to a computer tomorrow! Hope you are having a great start to your new year 🤗 🍕 #user_15 #user_15recipes (this is just for the link to work) #baladiabby #hotforfood https://youtu.be/w1QhoXsgwis
user_15;user_1599.jpg;2019, you have been one hell of a year. Our first house, our wedding, my dad's passing, and a lot of hard life lessons. Thank you for all the memories, may 2020 be full of more noodles, friends, and good health.
user_15;user_15100.jpg;I had an inexplicably terrible day yesterday, and the things that were upsetting me weren't even monumental, honestly I was just HARDCORE PMSing, and it's been a while since it has hit me that hard. 🖤 I was planning on filming a video about things I've learned from being vegan for 6 years and vegetarian for 2 before that, but I was in such a funk even after doing my hair and full face of makeup. I didn't want to waste all the effort I put into my face, so Eddie suggested we go out to Little Asia 😂 🖤 Today I'm heading to the gym, recipe testing and then attempting to film the video again, but I would love to hear from YOU! Some of you responded in the Q&A story I posted a while back, but I would love to hear it again: what nuggets of wisdom do you have from your vegan journey? What are things you wished you knew when you started? I'd love to include them in the video as a lil viewer submission section from you lovely folks 💕
user_15;user_15101.jpg;"I was pleasantly surprised by the vegan offerings from @proofkitchenlounge in K/W! We had a family Christmas dinner there with some of Eddie's side and it was such a nice experience! It's the restaurant inside the Delta Hotel (parking is free when you register your vehicle at the restaurant). 🖤 Sorry for the terrible picture quality, it is very atmospheric and dimly lit. We ordered the vegan bao, although I don't know what a ""bahn mi slaw"" is but there was definitely no bread in the slaw 🙄 also they spelled banh mi wrong. It had a gochujang tofu with lime, slaw and peanuts, and it was fairly tasty! 🖤 Eddie ordered the smoked whisky burger which is a @beyondmeat burger revamped with a black bean mixture on a pretzel bun and I had the Tuscan polenta which had a ratatouille on top with beyond sausage on the side. It was very good, I definitely ate it all. 🖤 Kudos to Proof for having such awesome vegan options that actually are well balanced (protein-wise) and super tasty! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #kitchenerwaterloo #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan"
user_15;user_15102.jpg;Creaming the (vegan) butter & sugar is mandatory for delicious cookies. Creaming the two means you're aerating the mixture and helping dissolve the sugar so you get nice, evenly crisp cookies in the end. 🍪 You can easily achieve this with a spatula and a bowl, but it's significantly easier and faster with a stand mixer or hand mixer. I don't really have much of a sweet tooth anymore unless it involves, chocolate, cookies, or ice cream (I guess that's a lot of sweets for this savoury tooth still) but these days, I can only handle a treat or two before my tastebuds are overwhelmed. 🍪 I know that this season is typically a hard time for people who have a history of disordered eating habits (like myself), but please take care of yourselves this holiday and allow yourself to eat without guilt. Listen to your body and stop assigning fear to food. 🍪 Life is about balance, and food-focused gatherings tend to be closely tied with love and friendship. You are going to be ok if you eat too much! Our bodies are resilient and you do not need to work out to make up for whatever you've eaten. (Also that's not how weight loss works) Your body is beautiful and you should move to celebrate your body, not punish yourself. 🍪 I busted my lower back from horsing around with smol children on Monday and I am still recovering from it even though I really wanted to go to the gym on Tues and today. I even felt a little reluctance in eating the cookies I baked because I couldn't work out but I stopped that train of thought because that fucking sucks and ate the delicious damn cookies. I feel fine haha (aside from my lower back). 🍪 Sending all of you love for whatever you are dealing with this holiday, life is always a bit of a roller coaster and it's always a little extra rickety around the holidays. Take care 🖤
user_15;user_15103.jpg;Happy holidays everyone! Eddie's working today so I'm at home editing some videos and baking up a storm haha. We have some stuff with Eddie's family tomorrow but my family left me in the north for warmer weather 😂 🎄 But I would love for you to hang out with me via my latest video on YouTube, where I cooked up some vegan #friendsmas love for 16 of my friends!

user_15;user_15104.jpg;I'm a sucker for chocolate chip cookies (or in this case, chocolate chunk!) This is @itslivb's recipe from her #veganonabudget cookbook which is full of super easy recipes and I'm going to be cooking through a few this week for a video in the new year. I'll leave a link to her cookbook (affiliate link) in my bio link feed if you want to check out her beautiful cookbook! 🖤 I have a question for YOU though: what is your penultimate favourite cookie? Are you a chocolate chip classic lover? Or do you stan a decadent cookie? Lemme know! I have a very special place in my heart for cookies and seeing so many of you make my snickerdoodles, ginger molasses cookies, and my chocolate chip cookies is always a lovely perk in my day.

It is not the traditional way of making risotto (no wine!) but she sure is tasty.

user_15;user_15110.jpg;The ramen tour came and went and ultimately we were astounded at how difficult it is to get vegan ramen at ramen places because of the wishy washy communication! 🖤 Luckily for us, Saturday was successful because both @jinyaramenbar and @ramenisshin had clearly marked vegan options with knowledgeable servers. I found out when we went to @kenzoramen yesterday that all of their noodles have egg, despite me asking the location in Hamilton and being assured there were no animal products. 🖤 So, note to self, don't go to Kenzo! What a shame. So far of the three vegan ramens I've had, I put Isshin and Mystic at a tie (possibly @mystic.ramen edging slightly ahead because that tantanmen is LIFE) and Jinya to me is just good. I had the flying harvest ramen at Jinya and I have to say, I prefer their original creamy spicy ramen. But that's just me, @lfrae preferred it over the creamy spicy! 🖤 Random vlog of this weekend may be cobbled together soon, but for now, that concludes our GTA ramen tour! Where else should we go next? We wanted to go to @shiro_ramen_hamilton but their broth uses almond milk and I don't need hives :( lemme know your vegan ramen recs down below because y'all know I will make another weekend of it! 🖤 @umamiramenmontreal we are coming for you in 2020. 🍜🍜🍜🍜 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganramen
user_15;user_15111.jpg;Our first day of our 🍜Toronto vegan ramen tour🍜 was a great success! We're were humbled by how much we couldn't push our bodies because ramen is no joke and we thought we could handle THREE ramen in one day when we barely even finished two! 😂 We were sweet summer children. 🖤 Our first stop was at @ramenisshin and WHOA I was so happy with these noods! I got the spicy red miso ramen with kale noodles because their regular noodles have egg in them. You can also get rice noodles but the kale ones were nice and chewy! Very delicious, and the broth was aromatic and super rich! 🖤 My tour companion @laurafraserlettering got the roasted garlic ramen which BLEW ME AWAY with a flush of garlic flavour. I wish I had ordered this one first honestly, because my spicy miso was delicious but damn I am a sucker for roasted garlic. 9/10 would eat again!! 🖤 Video is a bit of a hodge podge of clips because I'm really bad at filming when I'm with friends, but hopefully it'll be up before the new year so you can get your holiday noodle fix too! Tis the season for slurpin noods 🍜 🖤 #user_15 #veganramen #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #torontovegan #vegansofinstagram
user_15;user_15112.jpg;Foodie friends are the greatest friends, especially if they're also vegan!! Going to go hard on the sodium this week because we're doing a mini vegan ramen tour in Toronto! We were going to get @mystic.ramen for takeout last night but their phone number is unassigned and we couldn't figure out if we could get take out for 4 people before they closed bahaha. 🖤 So we started our ramen tour with not ramen and instead laksa and not pho from Little Asia! Very delicious but it was WAY overseasoned. It's never usually this salty and I have no idea what happened, but if this is any indication of how this weekend is going to go, yo girl is gonna be quite bloated by the end 😂😂 its okay though. This is research. 🖤 We're planning on hitting up @ramenisshinqueenstreet and @jinyaramenbar today, then tomorrow we're going to @kenzoramen! So much ramen goodness 🍜 hope you are also having a delicious weekend! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganramen #littleasia #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan
user_15;user_15113.jpg;My super simple vegan cheddar cheese ball got DEVOURED within 15 minutes at my Friendsmas party (which was a grand ol' time!) I knew I had to post the recipe ASAP because I low key force fed it to some of our biggest skeptical friends and they were not expecting this cheese ball to be so good. 🖤 Now its your turn to make this cheeseball and turn some heads for your skeptical omni friends and family because y'all it's almost 2020 and people still think all we eat is salad and that we don't like cheesy things. HELL NAW. For this I will not stand.

user_15;user_15114.jpg;"Last weekend I had the honour of dining with the legendary @ruthtalfresh with the vegan squad (@twomarketgirls @meatfreeathlete & @avraepstein) where we all got to bond over food, the legacy of @freshrestaurants and our passion for empowering women. 🖤 When Fresh, the vegan restaurant you've been going to for over 7 years because that was your only decent vegan option in your area, invites you to dinner with their founder, you say YES! We got to try a bunch of their new menu items (HELLO dumplings and silky hummus) and I caved and got not one, but two ginger fireballs and got a sip of their golden milk latte which is a delightful cloud of light sweetness. My sore throat is so thankful. 🖤 It was so nice to chat, feel reassurance, and to learn about how much Fresh has grown over the years to innovate and trailblaze for vegan restaurants in Toronto. I truly don't think people would have the same perception of vegan food NOR our amazing selection of vegan restaurants in Toronto if it weren't for Fresh/Ruth Tal. 🖤 I've been feeling this imposter syndrome/quarter-life crisis because I see people my age being doctors, lawyers, dentists, company CEOs, or just general badass entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, here I am with a BA and MA and scraping by making recipes and videos on the internet. The constant feeling of ""I should be doing more"" or ""I should be doing better"" is so hard to shake and a night out with people who can sympathize from one time or another was honestly so reassuring. 🖤 So much respect for @ruthtalfresh and everything she has accomplished while being true to herself. Seriously so inspired by her. Thankful for our #vegansquad for empowering and supporting each other. Time to hit my Monday with a slap of motivation and energy in the hopes that one day I can be as successful and positive as she is. 🖤 #user_15 #freshrestaurants #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #vegansoftoronto (if it wasn't already clear, this meal was gifted by Fresh)"
user_15;user_15115.jpg;Soaking in the sunset today 🌇 I've been juggling a few too many things lately and my body is still not at 100% yet. Tomorrow Eddie and I are hosting Friendsmas and we are very excited albiet I am feeling the unprepared stress because our house is still not guest-ready yet. 🖤 But I made some phallic looking seitan yesterday (you'll know what I mean if you saw my stories) and I am going to wrap those in puff pastry to bake tomorrow! Heading into the city today for a dinner with the #vegansquad and @freshrestaurants's @ruthtalfresh and I am so ready to pick her brain because she is obviously a business savvy woman and I got a slap of reality today that reminded me that business is business and I need to be more skeptical of the kindness of others sometimes. I'm green and naive and I need to change that. 🖤 Tonight I need to prep pumpkin pie (recipe is already on the blog!), stuffing and a cheeseball, then tomorrow I bake up my sausages wrapped in puff pastry (not really very wellington shaped anymore unfortunately), whip up my ultimate mashed potatoes (recipe coming soon), and assemble some sort of cheese board for snacking! It's supposed to be a potluck but yo girl is a control freak and needs to cover the basics 😅 🖤 Been feeling very bleh lately and hopefully I can start back up at the gym on Monday without coughing, and get things back on track! Hope you are all having a lovely weekend ❄️ 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_15116.jpg;Kinda wish I had @twomarketgirls around all the time to style my house and dinner table on the regular haha. They have such a good eye whereas I am simply just lazy LOL. My contribution is brush lettering. 🖤 Sorry I've been slacking on the video uploads lately! Finally feeling semi-human again! I have 2+ videos in the tank I need to edit and get out but I've been working on a secret project and hopefully that will come to fruition eventually to be something you can see soon. In the meantime I will continue to be very vague because I am terrible at secrets and I just want to tell you what I've been working on 😂😂 #user_15
user_15;user_15117.jpg;Doughnuts offer a temporary relief, even though the amount of liquid in my sinuses came back this morning with a vengeance. 🖤 Day 6 of my longest cold yet, has yet to subside :/ normally I can bounce back from a cold after a couple days but this one is a doozy. It's messed with my appetite, my brain, and my ability to sleep. I would very much like to resume my normal very busy life anytime now :/ 🖤 But thankful I had Eddie to cart me to @beechwooddoughnuts last week when I had the energy to shower because I just wanted donuts (then my cycle came the next day lol). Period & a cold? Happy December to me 😂 but seriously the sprinkle donut and their chocolate CRONUT is everything. 🖤 Hope any of you fellow sickos are getting lots of rest and liquids. I live vicariously through ye healthy folk. 🖤 #user_15 #beechwooddoughnuts
user_15;user_15118.jpg;I'm on day 4 of this weirdly annoying and headache inducing head cold and I just want to be able to breathe out of both nostrils again so I can go back to the gym! 🖤 I went to a gentle yoga class on Wednesday and since then I haven't had the energy to go work out :( also I'm pretty sure someone going to the gym sick is how I got sick in the first place so I don't want to continue the cycle. 🖤 Anyway I got some epic vegan ramen from @mystic.ramen in the Hamilton Farmer's Market and I am so pumped to recreate this. I had never had tantanmen before and I am definitely now more familiar with the profile. Rich, spicy, creamy and full of umami. PLUS the BBQ seitan from the vegetarian store was a great addition to this. I love when vendors work together! 🖤 #user_15 #veganramen #tantanmen #hamiltonvegan #hamiltonfarmersmarket
user_15;user_15119.jpg;"I am always so thankful to see so many of you making my recipes for your vegan thanksgiving 🥰 you all seemed to really enjoy our #squadsgiving vlog and spread on my channel and that was awesome! I love that so many of you were pumped for your own vegan Thanksgiving because of it and so many of you are making a difference by opting out of animal agriculture and eating a more ethical diet. 🖤 However, I would like to remind you that while it's important to spend time with loved ones over food, it's equally important to remember that what Thanksgiving historically represents is actually awful and everything we stand against when it comes to a more ethical lifestyle. 🖤 Be mindful that when you say ""No one had to die for my dinner this Thanksgiving"", you ignore the historical genocide, cultural erasure, and the ongoing systematic oppression of Indigenous and First Nations people. 🖤 Support Indigenous creators, activists, and communities, either financially, with your time (i.e. volunteering) or simply by educating yourself and listening. They have been fighting for intersectionality and sustainability long before any of us have ever done, and we still have lots to learn from their ongoing fight and lots more work to do to support them. 🖤 #thanksgiving #veganthanksgiving #indigenousrights #intersectionality"

Fives months have flown by and we still haven't finished our thank you cards 😬 a lot of things have happened this year and I am grateful for everything despite all that has happened. 🖤 I've been watching some of our old wedding planning videos and reminiscing on the process. Despite how stressful everything was, it was a lot of fun. I've been meaning to finish writing up my wedding vendor and recap post but it's been sitting in a draft for months now haha. Maybe in the new year! 🖤 For now, I am just so happy to not have to plan something that big again 😂 (Eddie is definitely happy to be done with that too hahaha) I love gatherings, especially around food, but dang, wedding planning is a wild ride.

user_15;user_15127.jpg;I don't know what it is about this time of year, but a lot of my life changes occur around November. I went fully vegan 6 years ago around this time, I started weight lifting this time last year (and then fell off around New Years because my old gym did a bunch of shady stuff), and this year, I went hard into prioritizing body positivity and learning to accept me. 🖤 New haircut, new fitness routine, new focus on my goals. Life has thrown a lot at me and Eddie the past year and we are refinding our footing. Winter always seems like a fresh start for me and it's time to brave the cold. 🖤 Do you ever feel this way about winter?

user_15;user_15129.jpg;Love me some moody mushrooms! These are the main star in my vegan pâté that I posted on the blog this week. I've already devoured half of it...for er... Quality control 😅 but there's enough for the demo today bahah. 🖤 Currently in London, Ontario to demo some lemongrass tofu banh mi and I am hunnngry! Can't wait to see what is good at @vegfestlondonon! I'm on stage at 4:30, hope to see y'all there! 🖤 #user_15 #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #mushrooms🍄
user_15;user_15130.jpg;Life threw me some curveballs this week and I only needed a couple days to bounce back unlike my usual week of super lows. I think my new gym habit has helped me get out of those funks a lot faster since it sort of forces me to fuel myself properly and shower. Is that TMI? 🖤 Whenever stuff gets really rough I tend to zombie up and just sort of drift through my day with no appetite or motivation, and it's really frustrating when there's so much I want to get done. Even sitting down and forcing myself to work produces seriously subpar content so I've had to just wait it out and jump on the next wave whenever one begins to crest. 🖤 Coming out of my funk (and eczema flareup) yesterday, I finally got to prep the pâté and đồ chua for my lemongrass bánh mì demo at @vegfestlondonon and I'm so excited! I hope you'll be there :D my demo is at 4:30, so I hope you stick around the festival to see me do what I do for videos but in real life (you probably will see the weird stuff I usually cut out of videos baha) 🖤 Link for the pâté recipe will be in stories/highlights (whenever IG lets me) and in the bio. Hope that if you are in a low right now that you do something to take care of yourself.

user_15;user_15132.jpg;Marmite, avocado, and furikake! Just listening to my bod and my body wants iron-rich, fatty and salty foods. (Hi hello menstrual cycle, I HEAR YOU). I started a slightly more aggressive gym program (the foundation program by @stephanie_buttermore), so I need to get the ball rolling in the mornings with better fuel than ramen 😅 ramen is love, ramen is life, but that was too much liquid for me before the gym bahaha. 🖤 Today I'm fueling the gym with this 'cado toast and a cup of tea. I've exited coffee phase and am deep in orange pekoe. My caffeine headaches have mostly gone away but I do have a slight thrum in my head in the mornings when I don't sleep very well, so a hot cup of tea with @silk_canada creamer and a touch of vanilla sugar has been 👌 🖤 Got a big to do list today, and I am very excited to get through it! Although I also have been trying to feel ok when I don't get through my entire list. Because I am not a product, I don't need to be productive to be valued, which is a WILD concept in this v capitalist society. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #avocadotoast
user_15;user_15133.jpg;THE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR! 🍂 I know the weekend is over, but there is no time like the present to go outside and appreciate the beauty that is autumn leaves. I love the crunch of leaves, the smell of earth and rotting leaves (😂), and the crisp wind through the trees. 🍂 It's a reminder that I have to let go and ready myself for change. Big things on the horizon and I have to let be what I can't control and just go where the path leads me. I trust that with the support of my family and friends that things will all work out. 🍂 In the meantime, bánh xèo recipe will finally be up on Wednesday! I'm hyped 🤗 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike #vegansofig #mountnemo #brucetrail
user_15;user_15134.jpg;My family is wild and chaotic but they are family so I love em no matter what! I love that they love food as much as I do so it's always extra fun taking them out to eat because they are just as enthusiastic about delicious Asian food as I am. 🖤 My mom, my brother and I CRUSHED this rendang from Little Asia and it was wildly delicious. We also ordered the laksa (no egg), peanut tempeh, and pad kee mao because... I mean, noodles are life. 🖤 I really want to take them to @fatchoito next so they can experience delicious Malaysian food but that means one of us would have to drive to the city and both my mom and I dislike driving 😂😂 (this is usually when we ask Eddie to drive hahaha). 🖤 In any case, I am feeling very thankful for family, even though they drive me up the wall sometimes, as families tend to do haha. 🖤 #user_15 #littleasia #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15135.jpg;(AD) I know it's fall when one of my favourite varieties @sweetango_apple comes into season! They're only around for a short amount of time, especially this year since Hurricane Dorian really hit the crop hard in Nova Scotia this year, but I am so happy and thankful we still have some! Definitely grab some while supplies last. 🍎 A child of the Honeycrisp and Zestar apples, SweeTango apples have a perfect balance of a sweet and juicy crunch with a touch of tanginess. They are CRUNCHY and so dang good. Apples are one of my favourite ways to fuel hikes or the gym, that fast absorption of sugar combined with fibre helps me keep my energy up to keep walking and peeping these gorgeous fall leaves! 🍎 Especially since I am a huge sucker for inhaling granola bars and fig bars pre-gym, apples are a wrapper-less alternative that is easier on both the planet and my wallet 😂 I found these SweeTango apples at Fortinos in Hamilton, but you can find them at Longos, Costco, Loblaws and I believe alsooo Sobeys (but I am a PC points gorl lol) 🍎 #user_15 #sweetango #sweetangoapples #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15136.jpg;Another veganized Filipino comfort food classic!

user_15;user_15137.jpg;Practicing my onigiri skills! Experimenting for a blog post coming soon, but most importantly, playing to make some fun bentos for a couple of my friends who are coming on a hike to see the beautiful fall leaves with me. 🍙 Trying to go for more traditional Japanese, but vegan! I bought some vegan shrimp and of course, panko and avocado for some classic Japanese flavours. Unfortunately I couldn't find any pickled umeboshi otherwise I would have tried that too. 🍙 This onigiri was seasoned with some expired (lol) vegan furikake, @ikeacanada seaweed pearls, and soy curls mixed with some mayo and soy sauce. I also have some vegan pork floss that I kind of want to try to make into soy sauce bonito flake mix as a filling, but I'm not sure how well that will go together! 🍙 I just ate so much rice and mayo but it was so good 😂 Way too full now! Can't wait to peep some leaves and eat some onigiri with wonderful people. Any suggestions for fave Hamilton area hikes? We're a mix of beginner/intermediate hikers, but honestly my cardio sucks either way 😂 🍙 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #veganonigiri #veganjapanese
user_15;user_15138.jpg;"I got to catch up with an old high school friend that I have chatted with sporadically over the years but I'm pretty sure the last time we physically saw each other was in high school! 🖤 We went to @theheartyhooligan and I was blown away at how tasty this ""meat-lovers"" pizza bagel was. 10/10, would eat again! It is this rad vegan punk cafe with a food menu, coffee, drinks and a straight-edge menu too. Such a fun space full of amazing art too. We yammered on about old friends, food, mental health, books, and before I knew it, the two hours I had to catch up flew by and there was still so much more we wanted to talk about. 🖤 I can get along with pretty much anyone, but there are only a few people I manage to click with so quickly that we can't stop talking. It's always a fun time and I am so thankful that even now, at 29 and well after my more social years I can still connect with new (and in this case, old) friends. It's not like this with every new friend I make and it's always so nice to experience. 🖤 As a fairly introverted extrovert growing up, I was always terrified that I wouldn't make friends when I moved to a new school/place (I went to 4 elementary schools), but it's kind of cool seeing that I have so many good friends from each chapter of life. Some fall away and you drift because of changing interests, but that's just natural haha. 🖤 Anyway, I am just very grateful for patient and forgiving friends because this awkward duck is bad at juggling stresses and the last few months have been a doozy. It's nice to feel understood and heard and I can't wait to catch up with my friends again now that things have finally started to settle down. 🖤 And likewise, I am grateful to you. The comments on my YouTube videos and posts here have been so nice to read even if I haven't been able to answer everyone. Y'all are wonderful. Thank you for being here. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare"

user_15;user_15140.jpg;It was sweater weather but we busted out the BBQ for this vegan inihaw na manok (filipino BBQ chicken) all the same. Video with Janelle is up on the YouTubes and we chatted tons about growing up as Asians! Janelle grew up in Toronto while I grew up in a small town in Ontario, while Toronto was more diverse than where I was growing up, the food shaming from our peers was the same!! What's up with that?! 🖤 Who wants to live in a world without curry, (vegan) fish sauce, seaweed, sushi, noodles, and fried rice? Dang y'all. I have hope that all the wonderful parents I know are sharing food from different cultures with their kids and showing kids to be curious and respectful about foods from other cultures, rather than mean and disgusted. 🖤 Food is comfort, and it never feels good to have your favourite foods from your upbringing be shamed. May we as adults continue to practice curiousity and respect when it comes to trying new foods and learning about other cultures 🤗 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #filipinofood
user_15;user_15141.jpg;"Sadly my last Montreal food pic: @swirlmtl and their epic grapefruit and coconut swirl. Y'all, I don't care what time of year it is, I am always down for soft serve. I am so bummed that they weren't open for 2/3 days I had to explore in Montreal because you KNOW I would have eaten there every dang day haha. 🖤 I had a lovely chat with someone who had been vegetarian for 20 years and was contemplating the leap to fully vegan and he asked me about what made me go vegan. I explained that even before I was vegetarian, I refused to eat veal, and when I learned that the veal industry BECAUSE of the dairy industry, I was like, oh dang. It was a slap of reality, and the person I was talking to seemed motivated to go fully vegan! 🖤 But back to that realization, it made me feel so silly at the time. I did not realize that cows only produce milk after they've given birth, and if we are drinking the milk from a cow, the baby doesn't have food. Et voilà, veal industry. 🖤 I don't love talking about the terrible stuff that pushed me to go vegan, because it ain't pretty and I never want to shame people for what they don't know. It sucks, and I get that ice cream, cheese, and butter are tasty, but for me, as someone who has always wanted kids one day, the idea of taking someone's baby away so we can drink her milk made me so sad that I couldn't do it anymore. 🖤 Anyway, fast forward 6 years (I don't know my ""veganiversary"", only that I went fully vegan by this time 6 years ago), there are SO MANY dope vegan ice cream options. Maybe not in more rural areas, but at least in most urban centres, grocery stores have at least one brand of vegan ice cream. AND it's not that grainy icy stuff we used to have to eat. What a time to be vegan! 🖤 Anyway, I do my best to encourage people for the steps they take to go vegan. It's not easy sometimes. There is certainly a learning curve, and as someone who knew how to cook and bake, it took me about a year to make the transition, and I was already vegetarian! But it's been 6 years now and I am so grateful for this lifestyle. I have learned so much and I feel so much more at ease with my food choices. 🖤 What sparked the change for you?"

user_15;user_15143.jpg;I think I finally got the recipe right! Vegan bánh xèo in the works! The trick I have discovered is that the batter needs to be thinner than you think it should be, and you'll get those perfect crispy edges! 🖤 I found vegan shrimp and king oyster mushroom to be my favourite fillings, and if I were better at time management, mung bean would be good inside too. But since Eddie doesn't like shrimp or mushrooms, tofu is his filling of choice. Hopefully will be filming this tomorrow and getting the video out in the next month! 🖤 So many videos I need to edit for you :D I'm actually so excited for you to see them all. Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate! I am joining a friends potluck later tonight, but I always use Thanksgiving as a reminder that we live on stolen land and that we all need to do the work as settlers to support indigenous folks and the work they do. They took care of this land and it's inhabitants way better and way more sustainably before we even realized it was important. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare

I quite enjoyed the sushi, tofu, and tempura, but my absolute favourite was the salt & pepper ""seafood"". I've seen salt & pepper seasoned stuff on @marystestkitchen but never had tried it myself. So simple but so tasty! 🖤 Portions are small but thats just so you don't get in over your head while ordering haha. Its All You Can Eat, so as long as you eat everything you order, you can keep ordering! It was fairly reasonable in terms of pricing too! $18 for lunch I believe. 8/10 would eat again! 🖤 #user_15 #montrealfood #montrealvegan #yuanvegetarian"
user_15;user_15145.jpg;There are a lot of new folks and I thought since it's been a hot minute I'd reintroduce myself incase you aren't familiar with me! My name is Lisa, 2019 has been a hell of a year for me, full of highs and lows. I got married, I had tons of amazing adventures, I bought a house with my favourite human, and I restarted a fitness journey and fell in love with lifting, which I thought I would always hate. 🖤 I also experienced a lot of cancer and death in the people around me this year. I got hit with a wild amount of life curveballs and I was humbled by how little I could handle simple things I took for granted. I've learned a lot about my limits, myself, and I have lost my way a bit when it comes to developing recipes. My palate has drastically changed from when I first started my food blog in spring 2011: I went vegetarian in winter 2011, vegan in 2013, and went from being a baking blog to whatever it is I am now that I lost my sweet tooth. Veganism, sustainability, and intersectionality are my new loves and hobbies and I am finding it hard to juggle them all and create cohesive content haha. 🖤 2020 is my third decade on this planet and I have big plans and hopes! I'm still figuring things and I hope you guys will be here for the ride once I am fully back in the drivers seat. I'm so happy you're here with me and I would love to get to know you more! Who are you? Where are you from? Are you vegan? What would you love to see from me? 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_15146.jpg;Unpopular opinion: I didn't really enjoy @invitation_v 😬 the server was absolutely lovely and the kitchen was helpful in finding tree-nut-free options but y'all, my options were fairly limited and honestly, I tend not to enjoy Asian food made by non Asian folks. It is usually really westernized on top of being veganized and I just don't dig it 😅 🖤 I tried the satay skewers, but the peanut sauce was substituted with a chipotle sauce because apparently the peanut sauce had tree nuts in it too. The satay itself was good, a little salty, but I was really bummed about the lack of peanut sauce haha. 🖤 Eddie ordered the Yuba general tso if I remember correctly, and the yuba itself was really unique and tasty, but the veggies and rice were lackluster. I tried the rice and it didn't taste steam-cooked (or maybe it was just undercooked), but apparently I've ruined non-Asian style rice for Eddie because now he agrees steamed rice is superior 😂😂 🖤 I also got the sushi, and it was good, but not nearly as good as the sushi from Sushi Momo. I was spoiled by the epicness of that sushi I think haha. But again, it was a super expensive meal for two starters and a main! I think still around 55$ with tip and no drinks. Maybe I didn't order the right things but dang. I was super disappointed. 🖤 There were a lot of burgers and Asian-influenced bowls there, but I wasn't feeling a burger in such a pretty place, and I wasn't feeling westernized Asian food. I heard such raving reviews that ultimately I was just really disappointed. Let me know your experiences there, good and bad? 🖤 #user_15 #montrealvegan #invitationv #montrealfood
user_15;user_15147.jpg;I know I've been sharing a lot of Montreal content lately but we ate at so many places I wanted to let you know what I thought of 'em all! I initially came up to Montreal for @fvmtl to give a talk about intersectionality and veganism and then Eddie and I decided to extend the trip to be our honeymoon (sort of) because we haven't been able to afford a proper trip haha. 🖤 We had to cut a few corners and our Airbnb was a hot mess, but we had each other and lots of food so that's all that counts, right? Haha. Here are a few little snippets of our excursion where we ended the night with some @beavertails_official! They're not all vegan, but the pastry is vegan and many of the toppings can be vegan so long as the pastry isn't buttered. Their menus are typically marked for vegan options too! Eddie got the Oreo beavertail, while I got my favourite: Killaloe Sunrise (cinnamon sugar with a wedge of lemon). She isn't the most aesthetic looking but she's the right amount of sweet & tart haha. 🖤 I have a vlog coming soon of the food we ate and some random things we did during our trip but I wasn't very diligent about filming because well, it was our honeymoon hahaha. We want to take a big trip somewhere one day where we can afford a nicer place to stay, but for now, our fleeting few days in Montreal were plenty of fun 💕 🖤 Also, hello new people! I feel bad that I messed up my theme on the day @vegnews shared their roundup of food accounts 😂 but hi, hello, I'm Lisa. Here you will find lots of vegan food, reviews, and probably a lot of oversharing hahah. 🖤 #user_15 #montrealvegan #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat
user_15;user_15148.jpg;"My favourite cuisine will always be Vietnamese, but Thai with the familiar levels of spice and sour flavour is close up there. I was excited to get Eddie to try @restaurantchuchai in Montreal, which is an all vegan Thai restaurant and it was full of delicious oily noodly goodness. 🖤 I got the pad kee mao, Eddie got the pad Thai, and we got the panang ""duck"" with sticky rice. My pad kee mao was very tasty and Eddie was very into his pad Thai (too sweet for me haha, but all pad Thais are like that for me), and the panang curry was good but far too salty for me. 🖤 Some of you told me I had to try the crispy ""duck"" but I totally missed it on the menu. Next time! We have tentative plans with our (newly married!!) vegan couple friends to do a weekend trip to Montreal to hit up some of our favourites again. The strategy with more people is that more people = more dishes we can share 😈😈 but not for Eddie because Eddie doesn't share food! 🖤 #user_15 #montrealvegan #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #chuchai #bestofvegan"
user_15;user_15149.jpg;I got to try the epic @bowheadpub last week and holy it is decadent! I really wanted to try the po boy but it had nuts in it, so I panicked and ordered the Monster Burger which had both a vegan chick'un and @beyondmeat burger patty which was WAY too much for me, but the pretzel bun was so good! 🖤 We also ordered the animal fries which were HUGE, Eddie and I thought we were just upgrading our side to a side-sized animal fries but nope. Its the full size haha. Definitely recommend sharing but it was actually so good too. We also ordered the chick'un wings which were interesting and a lot more stringy than I was expecting. Still good though! 🖤 Luckily we brought containers for leftovers because we basically had another full meal leftover afterwards but it was still really tasty warmed up the next day haha. 8/10, very tasty, would eat again. Would be even better if you enjoy beer because it was the perfect meal to have with some draught beer. 🖤 #user_15 #montrealvegan #bowheadpub #veganfoodspot #whatveganseat #veganfoodshares
user_15;user_15150.jpg;I ate so much rich and salty food in Montreal that my body was seriously craving some veggie freshness, so for lunch before our hike up Mont Royale, we stopped by @lapanthereverte for some falafel goodness. 🖤 Eddie and I both ordered the falafusion which is basically a westernized falafel pita, and we both wished we got the traditional instead haha. It was super delicious, the pita is magically soft and chewy and the falafel itself is DREAMY! But I wish I stuck with my gut and got that good good pickled veg and tahini sauce. 🖤 We also got the poutine and was surprised that they used sweet potatoes instead of typical potatoes, and they had a brined tofu as their vegan cheese curds. Honestly, it was so dang good but not quite what I expected. The tofu chunks were tasty and reminiscent of cheese curds, the only bummer is that tofu doesn't melt haha. Would eat again though! 🖤 We wanted to get some falafel for the road home but traffic was so bad we forwent navigating Montreal which is like 80% always under construction hahaha. But all in all, a delicious time. I've eaten a ton of their falafel a few years ago, and I clearly would eat again haha. 🖤 #user_15 #montrealvegan #bestofvegan #whatveganseat
user_15;user_15151.jpg;I freaking LOVE bagels. I first came to Montreal when I was 17 on a work exchange for 6 weeks at a daycare where I basically just played with 18mo old babies for 8 hours a day and it was amazing. During the rest of the days and weekends, I zipped all around Montreal with our cohort of fellow teens on work exchange from all over Canada and it was one of the best summers I could have ever asked for. 🖤 Those six weeks were full of adventure, summer love, and most of all FOOD. I remember trying Montreal bagels for the first time and having my mind blown at how dense and chewy they were, compared to the giant ones I was used to at home. Montreal bagels have this other kind of pillowy chew that is unlike any other. 🖤 Typically they are either cooked briefly in a honey bath and/or coated with an egg wash, so the famous @stviateurbagel and @fairmountbagel aren't traditionally vegan, but Fairmont said they would do a vegan batch with 24 hrs notice when I was researching a couple weeks ago. I reached out about 36 hrs before I was going to stop by for bagels, but they didn't answer so no Fairmount bagels for me haha. 🖤 However, the champions at Bagel Beaubien were so nice and let me take pictures of their bagels AND have a bunch of vegan options. I left with a bag of warm, fragrant sesame bagels that I ate with the FANTASTIC @lesojami garlic & herb fermented soy cream cheese, only to come back just before we left Montreal so I could get another half dozen sesame and some cinnamon raisin ones for Eddie. 🖤 They are simply so delicious and I'm so thankful that Beaubien has vegan bagels without any hoops to jump though! 🖤 #user_15 #bagelbeaubien #montrealvegan #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15152.jpg;"We're on the way back home now and our mini moon has been short and sweet 💕 we had some hits and misses when it came to vegan restaurants here, but I have a feeling it's mostly because of my nut allergies. I'll share my review of all the places we went to over the next week or so, but let's start off with the first dinner once Eddie got into town. 🖤 I did my best at informing restaurants ahead of time of my allergies but sometimes restaurants cater really hard to soy-allergic folks and rely a lot more on cashews and almonds. Unfortunately I'm kind of used to it haha, but we make do. The servers at @lovrestaurant were really kind and accommodating and did their best to communicate with the kitchen. They were lovely! 🖤 Foodwise, we had just an ok experience. I ordered the Truffles & Caviar, which were soy sauce caviar bubbles (I assume agar or tapioca based) with shiitake on a bed of zucchini noodles and a drizzle of truffle oil. It was fragrant, interesting and beautiful, but I had to ask for salt because there wasn't enough seasoning (aside from the soy sauce caviar). Once salted it was better, but this dish lacked protein. 🖤 I also ordered the kale & squash mac and cheese but because the almond parm was a no go for me, I forwent the parm. This was so bland I had to add a decent amount of salt to bring out the squash flavour. I like savoury foods but I'm actually pretty sensitive to salt, so if something was underseasoned for me, that means it was pretty bland. 🖤 Eddie ordered the caesar with tempeh bacon (I know, he willingly ordered something with tempeh, SHOCK), but when the large arrived, we were kind of surprised at how small it was and it also didn't even have any tempeh. Eddie said ""it's aight"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ but yeah, I was pretty surprised it was so small. 🖤 With tip and no drinks, the total was $55 for those 3 dishes, two of which were starters. I also was hungry again about half an hour later (which, fair, I did order zucchini noodles). I know LoV is coming to Toronto soon so I hope things will be better, but so many of you recommended this restaurant to me I am really sad I didn't have a better experience. 🖤 #user_15 #veganmontreal"
user_15;user_15153.jpg;"My Montreal trip has been so full of delicious food so far and I definitely need to come back and try some other places we can't squeeze in. I had the loveliest time with @odilejp talking veganism, politics, photography, and food and it was so nice to finally meet. 🖤 We shared a meal at @sushimomomtl and it was seriously so delicious. They NEED to come to Toronto to show them how vegan sushi can be done. Tenon vegetarian is great, but they have a ton of stuff that has dairy and eggs in it, and is totally unnecessary (if only that veg salmon was vegan 😭) 🖤 We ordered the ""poutine"", which was sweet potato maki rolls fried and under a blanket of various sauce/toppings and some gooey melted cheese. Was it delicious? Yes! Would I eat it again? For sure! But definitely not something I would consider poutine 😂. We also had the shared meal for two which came with beet tartare (7.5/10, needed more taro chips haha), miso soup (8/10, it was delicious and oddly kinda sweet) and an assortment of 5 nut-free rolls which I cannot remember what they are. 🖤 My absolute favourite one of the bunch was the bottom right one in that last photo, it had crispy puffed quinoa on top I think, or maybe it was rice? But inside was umami mushroom goodness that I couldn't believe. So good! There was also a jackfruit one that was pretty delicious. 🖤 I just want more sushi now, but there are still plenty of places I need to try first before I do a repeat 😂 Montreal!! You have so much amazing vegan food. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #sushimomo"
user_15;user_15154.jpg;(ad) My favourite summer fruit is definitely the juicy peach. I'm a sucker for peach anything, so I am so happy I was able to visit a few peach orchards and packing facilities to share the behind the scenes with you. 🍑 My latest video was all possible thanks to @producemadesimple and I hope you enjoy all the peach goodness. I have a link in stories/highlights and the bio for you if you have seen the youtube video already 🤗 🍑 📸:@jesusmazaphoto #user_15 #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #user_15recipes #whatveganslooklike http://bit.ly/2m5XvAN
user_15;user_15155.jpg;It took me a while to be able to listen back to this footage where I am living my best life frolicking in the peach orchards and giggling with some of my favourite people after what has happened in the last month. 🖤 I finally was able to edit this video and I'm so glad. It was truly one of the best days of the summer and I'm so happy I can share it with you. Check out my latest vlog from the @producemadesimple peach industry tour (ad) and celebrating @laurafraserlettering's veganiversary from a month ago. It was such a wonderful day. 🖤 All of this delicious food was from Zen Gardens, and YES! It is all vegan. Their menu is mostly vegan but there are a few vegetarian items to watch for. Everything is clearly marked, though. I'll leave a list down below of all the things that we ordered, but you should just watch the video 🤗 🖤 In order of appearance: siu mai, bbq buns, hot & sour soup, tom yum fried rice, fried enoki mushroom balls, bbq seitan & curry vermicelli. We also had sweet & sour soy balls but I didn't get a picture. Video linked in my stories & bio 🤗 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #zengardens http://bit.ly/2m5XvAN #user_15recipes (not actually a recipe its just how I get links to show up in my bio lol)
user_15;user_15156.jpg;I take any excuse I can to go to @bibimbap_to because of how delicious their kimchi fries are. They are literally perfection. 🖤 I'm doing better than I was last week, and I have been getting frustrated at how useless I am these days. It's days like these where I miss the structure of my old office job back in Ottawa and just being another cog in the machine. I often worry if I made the right choice, to do what I do now. 🖤 I am not the best vegan advocate. I'm not the best content creator. But from what y'all continue to tell me over and over, I am the best me and the content I make is apparently funny and relatable to all you weirdos and that is reassuring. I like making you laugh and I love when y'all send me pics or videos of your babies or fur babes watching my videos. Seriously the highlight of this job hahah. 🖤 Hoping to get a video out about peaches this week before peach season is totally over because there was some amazing stuff I learned about peach farming in Ontario earlier this summer.
user_15;user_15157.jpg;Kind of a zombie, but trying to maintain some sort of control in my life by cooking more and going to the gym more. I feel productive with my body but my mentally I'm still kind of struggling. 🖤 Been experimenting with a baked buffalo tofu for a workshop with @darnabati soon but I'm really struggling to find inspiration to cook. My appetite hasn't been that great, so I'm just trying to work with what I've got. 🖤 Trying to get some work done today because bills still gotta get paid and when you're self employed, if you don't work, you can't get paid 😪
user_15;user_15158.jpg;Sometimes I get flack in the comment section of my videos for eating so much junk food. Especially on my recent Buffalo haul, but it's not like I'm going to buy fruits and vegetables in Buffalo when I can buy that here. That doesn't make sense 🤔 🖤 I've been doing a lot of work to move away from assigning value to food (guilt/guilt-free, cheat meals, clean, indulgences) and been trying to focus on eating whatever it is I feel like eating. I've even been accused of eating so much processed food on a vlog where I eat avocado toast and hummus flatbread for 2/3 meals. Excuse me? 🖤 So I eat ramen when I feel like it, and greens when it suits me. Obviously it's healthier to not eat any processed foods at all, but what is life without potato chips, instant ramen, or vegan cheese? Lay off y'all. I have never been about eating perfectly healthy, I just eat what feels good to me. 🖤 Recently I've been feeling the onset of a cold creeping up on me and I've been trying to stave it off with plenty of fruits, veg, fibre, and liquids, but I wanted comfort food too 😂 enter @freshrestaurants after eating too much at @vegfoodfest! 🖤 Top left was @meatfreeathlete's wrap but I got the Essential Greens bowl, basically steamed Asian greens on brown rice with marinated tofu (tbh I thought I'd get more than one piece when I ordered a small) and peanut sauce. It was satisfying and tasty, but I wanted the buffalo cauliflower so I ate until I was comfortable and felt good 🤗 🖤 Also I had the ginger fireball, which was a shot of juiced ginger with hot water and maple syrup with candied ginger on the side and it was just what I needed to stave off the cold. 🖤 Feeling kind of allergic to stuff today and trying to work but the videos I try to make when I feel terrible are also terrible so I'm going to take this big cancer moon energy and pour it into doing some deep cleaning in my house. Also grieving is weird. The logistics after people die are weird and frustrating. I am grateful to all of you and my friends for lending their ears these past few days. 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #freshrestaurants
user_15;user_15159.jpg;"Thai food has a special place in my heart. It is so similar to Vietnamese cuisine with the use of spice, acid, and umami flavours that my savoury noodly heart can never resist.  The things that set Thai and Viet food apart for me is Vietnamese food often sneaks in freshness in ways that balance the richness of a dish, or ease the digestion with a functional but delicious part of the meal. And honestly, the practicality, variety of texures, and the deliciousness of Viet food will always win out over other cuisines for me. Maybe I'm biased though haha.  Anyway, Thai will always be a close second to top Asian cuisines for me, especially when prepared by Little Asia in Dundas. I took @rollercoastervegan and we ordered the tempeh satay (10/10), the green papaya salad (8/10), the nasi goreng (9/10), and the laksa (10/10). Eddie had pad thai because ""Eddie doesn't share food"" 🙅‍♂️ and they gave us some free fried banana because they see me come in way too often with different people all the time 😅"
user_15;user_15160.jpg;As I mentioned in my last post, it definitely feels weird to feel happy, but equally weird to feel sad, but I am so grateful to the people who have swarmed me with support this weekend. As an extremely introverted extrovert, I am equally energized by people as I am worn out by them, but being with my family, @rollercoastervegan, @twomarketgirls, @meatfreeathlete, @lovewildlivefree and of course 🖤@broadcasteddie 🖤 has been so helpful for me through this grieving process.  This weekend has been full of good food, people, and feelings and it is wonderful to feel acknowledgement and validation for how complicated my father's death is for me. I am feeling so thankful for all your messages, comments, and DMs about this all, if I don't answer, please know I have read it and appreciate it, I'm just a little overwhelmed.  Trying to throw myself into exercise, work, and some distraction to get myself through the next few weeks to rediscover my normal. But in the meantime, there's always comfort in good food 😊  This was a combo of chickpeas, potatoes, and plantain in my repurposed Earth Balance tub at @vegfoodfest from @dscaribbeanfusioncatering. I loved seeing so many people bring containers from home to Veg Fest. Y'all make my eco-nerd heart happy.
user_15;user_15161.jpg;Today was the first of seven Sundays to start my dad's journey to the next life. I haven't talked much about him, honestly we didn't have a good relationship to begin with, and havent even had a relationship at all for the last few years. But I figured I should explain what has been going on lately. My dad was diagnosed with liver cancer earlier this year and passed away on Thursday early morning.  Even though we had a really complicated relationship, I came to see him before he passed. It was hard and confusing, there was absolutely no closure, and I'm trying to grieve amidst living through this super busy season of veg fests, travel plans, and upcoming projects.  It feels weird to be sad, it feels weird to live my life happily. But I'm working on grieving the relationship we never had and mourning the painful one we did. Duty and family obligations are difficult and weird, but this too shall pass. Thanks for everyone for being understanding on why I haven't been posting new recipes or videos.  The noodle soup above is Bun Bo Hue, from Saigon Lotus in Toronto. Hue is where my dad was originally from and it felt fitting for this post.
user_15;user_15162.jpg;It's been a really hard week for me, but having good food and good company to distract me has been wonderful. @vegfoodfest has been a blast so far, and we've been eating so much great food! 🖤 Got the Big Mock and chili cheese fries from @sausagepartytoronto and they are always a good time. Rad folks, rad people 😍 🖤 I've got some more pictures in the stories, but @twomarketgirls and @rollercoastervegan indulged me in a lil picnic before our day got started 👯 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #vegfoodfest #torontovegan
user_15;user_15163.jpg;A little protein packed lunch today: tofu scram with firm and soft tofu to get that ultimate eggy bounciness, of course with some black salt to get that epic eggy flavour. I also added some spinach, salsa and hot sauce for some flavour. 🖤 I've got some videos I need to edit to get out, but I haven't been experimenting much in the kitchen lately. Some stuff happening in my personal life is kind of taking over and I'm still figuring out how to deal with it. I don't know how people carry on in their day to day lives when personal stuff takes over. Sometimes I think I must be really weak because I'm so sensitive to this kind of stuff. 🖤 It feels weird to be happy and equally weird to be sad. I've been distracting myself with video games, the gym, events, and the busy-ness of food fest season, but I need to deal and get shit done again. I'm just having a hard time. My mom, brother, Eddie and I are in good health for any of y'all who are concerned. Thanks for your patience.
user_15;user_15164.jpg;"Visited some vegan friends in Stratford and none of us could turn down the opportunity for some showstopping buffalo chick'un sandwiches on a pretzel hoagie from @theplanetdiner and their amazing donuts. 🖤 Sandwich was a HOT MESS but it was a party in my mouth and we've established that I'm consistently a hot Leo cancer moon mess soooo I mean, it's just on brand now. Had fries and gravy on the side because the caesar salad had nuts, but both fries and gravy were deeeeelicious (btw, if you have a severe nut allergy I do not recommend dining here lol, nuts errwhere). 🖤 Eddie got the strawberry donut (tasted like strawberry pocky), I got the chocolate marble donut, and we still have the apple fritter to eat for breakfast tomorrow 😈 but these donuts were so FLUFFY but also rich because they use coconut milk. 🖤 10/10 would eat again. The only thing that sucks is that they have meat options (their slogan is ""where herbivores can bring their carnivores"") and while I applaud a small town like Stratford in having a place with so many vegan goodies, it is confusing and kind of jarring to still see meat as an option. 🖤 The menu doesn't have any signage that it's like this btw, this is real meat. You kind of just have to realize that the pulled pork is not vegan. This is a different scenario compared to an omni place with vegan options. The ethical standpoint isn't the focus for omni restaurants, whereas that's kind of the focus for most vegans. 🖤 I also overheard a ""carnivore"" order the chick'un burger because he didn't trust a vegan place to have fresh pulled pork (mind you, this comment was at 11 am today, aka right when they open on a Sat) so it was both great and confusing that the omni ordered a vegan dish, but didn't trust the omni option. So weird. 🖤 Anyway, I am so curious as to what you guys think about ""meat-options"" on vegan menus. Let me know down below! Also have you tried The Planet Diner yet?! I can't wait to go back to eat more donuts, and also eat the one I have saved for breakfast 🤫 🖤 #user_15 #theplanetdiner #stratford #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare"
user_15;user_15165.jpg;I'm trying to think of a positive and uplifting caption for these beautiful donuts from Beechwood doughnuts but it seems that I've hit the bottom of my well of positivity today. 🖤 This week is a tough week and I can't really share why, but I could use your good vibes right now. Life is all ebb and flow and this week it seems there's a lot of ebb happening. 🖤 A friendly reminder to take care of yourselves, mentally and physically. You are loved and you matter.
user_15;user_15166.jpg;I haven't been able to get into the gym for a couple weeks and any of the time I've had the time is during peak hours at the gym. Too many people at the gym makes for an unpleasant workout, but I still wanted to do something active so Eddie and I headed out to our favourite hike at Tew's Falls. 🖤 Worked up a sweat and got to peep some beautiful views! The perfect way to end a day working on a secret project 🤫 feeling thankful for the energy and mobility today. Putting that energy towards an hour of activity (whether it's gym, yoga, or even a nice stretch sesh) was so nice and honestly, quite energizing. It's weird how activity does that 😂 🖤 Hope you are all having a lovely start to your week! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike #tewsfalls #dundasontario #dundaspeak
user_15;user_15167.jpg;"Some of you know I recently moved to a new city, and I've been loving getting to know Hamilton! The vegan scene is growing here, and honestly, people are either SUPER nice or oddly inconsiderate. Like in any of the cities I've lived in, there's always off interactions with people, but I definitely had the most number of them in Hamilton compared to other places I've lived (and I've lived all over!) 🖤 I went out for lunch with an old friend/colleague from my uOttawa days at @berkeleynorthkitchen and not gonna lie, I was impressed! The staff were so nice and they have some fairly clear vegan options (not that many but it's just a lil lunch menu) but they only had almond milk in the kitchen. But because of my allergy, the staff was SO nice and they went next door to @relaycoffee where they had oat milk and soy milk as options for me. 🖤 I had the ""Build-Your-Own-Salad"" option with the falafel (9/10, v delicious), some buttery lettuce, plenty of fun fruity toppings, and some couscous underneath. It was beautiful and tasty, but maybe it's just me but I was definitely hungry again after an hour 😂 my friend couldn't finish her salad though hahah. I think I just eat a lot LOL. But would I come back? Sure! It was a fun lunch date and everything was so nice and tasty. Just might need a snack if you're a hungry gal like me. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #berkeleynorth #hamiltonontario"
user_15;user_15168.jpg;Can we just take a moment and really think of how far we have come for the vegan movement? We have amazing meat analogues that show people that you don't have to eat animals to have tasty AF food. 🖤 Yesterday I did a taste test of the new @beyondmeat ground meat that we got from Buffalo. Verdict? It was a little too real (aside from the cat food smell) but it was actually so good. My kitchen still kinda smells like cat food but honestly? Kinda worth it! 🖤 The next time we go to Buffalo, we'll be definitely getting some more because I want to turn this into meatballs, chili, dumplings, nem nuong, ravioli filling... Seriously the possibilities are endless. It is ridiculous. 🖤 Full review and taste test in highlights and stories friends. Have you tried it?!

My birthday BBQ was amazing and it was so nice to have people over, play party games, est tons of vegan food, and just be surrounded by hilarious lovely people. 🖤 Also I've been feeling so supported by you guys who've watched and commented on my last video. For the people who disagreed with me, many of you posted some good points that I will definitely consider, and I now have a lot to research about sustainable palm oil. But all in all, I'm so happy to see so many 💩 vegans because that means you are still vegan 99% of the time! 🖤 Today I have one more day with my family and then performing at Burlington Music Hall tonight for our concert band.

Our growing season here isn't quite as long, sunny, and predictable as in other parts in the world, but we learned on the tour that peaches like the hot and cold fluctuations. 🍑 In their words, they like to ""suffer"" and we get some pretty incredible fruit because of it! So feeling thankful to live in a place in the world that supports amazing tender fruit like peaches, nectarines, grapes (both table grapes and wine grapes 😉), apricots and plums! Summer means taking advantage of all the Ontario goodness while I can! 🍑 Check out my stories (I'll also save into my farm industry tour highlights) for all the peach info, and a huge thank you to Produce Made Simple for working with me and enabling me to become a produce ambassador for y'all. DREAM COME TRUE! They were the perfect birthday present that I can turn into peach pie and cobbler (both recipes on the blog) for my birthday BBQ this weekend! 🍑 #user_15 #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #veganfoodshare @onttenderfruit @ontproduce #loveontfood"
user_15;user_15171.jpg;(ad) Naan grilled cheese? ✔️ Caramelized onions? ✔️ @cal_pear? ✔️ You got yourself a delicious lunch with this caramelized onion grilled cheese with California pears! 🍐 If you haven't seen the video yet, definitely check it out! I mixed up the filming style a little bit and y'all have seemed to be VERY into this sandwich combo. Are you a savoury or sweet pear kinda person? 🍐 I'll leave a link in the bio and highlights 😘 thanks California Pears for sponsoring the recipe & video 🖤 #user_15 #user_15recipes #californiapears #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare http://bit.ly/2MZv9nv
user_15;user_15172.jpg;☀️🍦😁 Eddie took this picture of me with some coconut based tiramisu ice cream from @sweetolenkas and all I could think of was wow I'm channeling some @veganeatsnyc here 😂 🍦 #user_15 #whatveganseat #whatveganslooklike #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15173.jpg;Whenever I am too lazy to cook, I somehow manage to convince Eddie to go out for dinner to Little Asia in Dundas 😈 this was our dinner when @mhycal came and brought us @marystestkitchen croissants to bake 🥐 Now I want more pad see ew and croissants 😭 but we're off to @stjacobsmarket to see what vegan goodies they have today and visit with some friends! I'll post updates in stories today! 🖤 Do y'all have any suggestions for St Jacobs vegan finds? I always hit up The Strudel Lady and in the past there has been a vegan gelato soft serve place, but I haven't been back since! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #dundasontario #littleasia
user_15;user_15174.jpg;Time for another #vegansquad adventure! @virtuous_pie invited me to try their new summer menu (on the house) and let me invite the rest of the squad to try it with me! 🍕 WHAT WE ORDERED: Kale Caesar Salad (8/10), Succotash Salad (7/10), Garlic Knots (8.5/10) & 4 Pizzas: Stranger Wings (9/10), Sweet Pepper & Sausage (8/10), Pesto CBR (8.5/10) and the Street Corn (had nuts, couldn't try, but this was Kat's favourite) 🍕 I am a big pizza fan, and while I love all the flavour combos and amazing toppings, I find the VP crust to be a bit too dry for me. I love thin crust, but VP's is somewhere between lavash bread and flatbread. That being said, my ratings were still pretty high because the toppings were that delicious! Def recommend getting a dip for the crust. 🍕 They were able to make nearly everything we ordered nut-free, which is amazing! Eddie wished he could try their cashew mozzarella but then I wouldn't have been able to eat so we ended up only getting one nut-full pizza (which he didn't eat because he doesn't like corn haha). 🍨 DESSERT TIME: So there was only one nut-free option for me, which was the Thai Tea flavour and WHOA it was really delicious. Super creamy, smooth and vanilla & tea flavoured with a coconut base 9/10 would definitely eat again. Eddie got the Salted Caramel & Chocolate Covered Pretzel but the pretzels were soggy. He said he liked everything else about it though. From what I could tell, the cashew based looked not as smooth and creamy as the coconut based one I had, but you be your own judges! 🍕 OVERALL: V delicious, super friendly staff, great allergy-knowledge and accomodation, and they even have a cute little patio! Would eat again :D 🍕 #user_15 #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #virtuouspie FYI this was not an ad, but we didn't pay for any of the food. As always, I am completely honest and these are my true feEeEelings 🤗
user_15;user_15175.jpg;Day 3 of cleaning out the fridge: I'm still eating lettuce cups 😂 I've had them for lunch the past 3 days and I'm not complaining! I think I have another day of lettuce cups to eat, and then I'm finally done eating through the bag! 🖤 Today's lettuce cups use ssamjang as a sauce, and stir fried locally grown onions and zucchini with overfermented kimchi, and white kimchi (not overfermented!) by @milkimchi that I grabbed from our Buffalo day trip! I had leftover rice from yesterday so I stir fried it together with my leftover onion/zucchini and it is ✨👌 the perfect fuel for my volunteer shift at @totes.the.goat today! 🖤 So many of you loved the footage from my shift there in yesterday's video and I'm so happy you enjoyed it! Megan and Mike are doing amazing work and I highly encourage you to support them (either with their merch or donating if you can, or just follow them and support their social media!) And find a local organization close to you that you can volunteer with, be it a farm sanctuary, food bank, women's shelter, or whatever you feel passionate about! 🖤 I am privileged enough to be able bodied and have the means to volunteer, so I'm doing what I can to lend a hand :) 🖤 #user_15 #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15176.jpg;REAL TALK: I am absolutely horrid at fridge management. I have no idea how my mom was always so good at cycling through the fridge and making sure we ate everything, but I suspect the lack of going out to eat ever was kind of integral. 🖤 I am a huge sucker for some of the epic vegan friendly restaurants that are within an hours drive for me, but I'm realizing how infrequently people actually cook these days! I know tons of people who meal prep and such, but with the rise of meal delivery, I'm noticing that fridge management is a skill that is definitely not being taught or practiced as much as it should. 🖤 Cleaning out the fridge today, and I unfortunately was too ambitious with some of the delicious fresh produce I had bought a couple weeks ago because I had to compost a full bag today—so heartbreaking to think about as well, because there are so many people who DON'T have access to fresh produce the way I do. 🖤 So again trying reset my fridge by cleaning it out, but we did just buy a bunch of different vegan yogurts and cheeses to try so my fridge is a little cramped 😬 today's fridge cleaning lunch was leftover Beyond burgers from a weekend BBQ chopped up and fried with some very fermented kimchi from @zerowastebulk that I got a few weeks ago, white rice, some ssamjang, and lettuce from a family friends garden (the same guy who gave me a giant garbage bag full of kale 😂) 🖤 Super delicious and was exactly what I was craving! Working my way though my fridge will be a good time this week 😋 what are you cooking up this week to clean out your fridge?? 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #cleaningoutthefridge #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15177.jpg;Y'all I made a smoothie that wasn't wildly too large!! I mean, it was still pretty big, but at least it wasn't unreasonable 😂 🖤 LOOSE RECIPE: 🌿 1 frozen banana 🌿 2 cups baby spinach 🌿 2 cup frozen kale 🌿 1 heaping cup frozen peach/strawberry/mango blend 🌿 1/2 cup pineapple juice 🌿 2 tbsp hemp seeds 🌿 1 scoop @amazinggrass_canada greens powder (optional) 🌿 Water to get your desired texture, I think I added 2 cups? 🖤 I only managed to drink half but Eddie is drinking the other half so 🤷 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15178.jpg;Got my new glasses today 🤓 although I guess this photo doesn't quite show how I like them haha, but I am very happy to have big lenses again because that means less of my periphery is taken up my frames 😅 🖤 The beginning of August always feels bittersweet to me. August is my birthday month and also the sign that summer is ending soon. So many good things but they happen so fast! I'm turning 29 and it feels closer and closer to 30 and I always fear I have nothing to show for how old I am. 🖤 But that's a me thing, and that's something I need to resolve on my own. I know there are many accomplishments in my life so far but this dissatisfied feeling is just a sign to me that I need to step it up and pursue what would make me feel accomplished at 29. 🖤 For my birthday, I would like to do a meetup in Toronto! The lovely @drpamela.rd is coming back to town and we wanted to hang out in the park and we would love it if you could join us! August 15 at Trinity Bellwoods at 6:30 :) I'll try to find a nice picnic blanket and we can have some snacks, chat about life and chill in the park, weather permitting 🤗 🖤 Hope to see you there! 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_15179.jpg;I used to think oatmeal was awful. It never had an appealing texture and it was always either bland or too sweet. It wasn't until I tried oats at a camp that I realized the potential that oatmeal had. 🖤 Humble, unassuming, filling and fibrous oats. The texture could be saved with cooking over the stove versus the instant kind with boiling water, and I realized I could add savoury ingredients and treat it like cháo (also known as congee or jook). 🖤 Inexpensive, typically locally grown, and rather fast to put together, oatmeal had become one of my favourite foods but I very rarely ever have it sweet. Mostly savoury and mostly steel cut. Steel cut, rolled, and instant oats are all the same nutritionally, but I find steel cut has the best texture when cooked as a porridge, while I prefer rolled oats for baking. 🖤 Did you grow up eating oatmeal? Or were you an oat-hater like me? I'm curious! Sound off in the comments y'all. 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15180.jpg;The other day, @mhycal made @marystestkitchen's croissants and brought them over to bake when he came to visit me! Michael was one of the first of my friends to go vegan and honestly it was so comforting to have a fellow Asian vegan friend. 🖤 Sometime being vegan can be lonely. There are so many wonderful things about being vegan, but loneliness is something that definitely is a part of the experience. I'm not sure if it is part of your experiences, but it definitely was a part of mine when I first started out. 🖤 It can be isolating to see the people around you will either make fun of your veganism, ridicule the movement, get extremely defensive it about it, or simply not get it. Even if your peers support you and your choices, if they are not vegan, the social impact is there. The cognitive dissonance is hard to ignore, and that can be lonely. 🖤 I've gotten very lucky that Eddie went vegan over time, my mom and brother are vegetarian, a handful of my friends are either vegetarian or vegan, and I have made a lot of vegan friends through Instagram and YouTube. But some of things that got me through the loneliness of veganism when I was first starting out was joining @torontoveg and volunteering at a bunch of their events and the Resource Centre. I met so many great people there and helped lead a meetup group to connect more vegheads together. 🖤 Now that I live outside of Toronto, I can't really volunteer there anymore, but I am still so thankful for the community that welcomed me when I was feeling very alone. Many of you have asked me how I found so many vegan friends, but honestly, it's a process! Some friends transitioned over time, but most are new! New friends are hard to make, but if you are looking for vegan friends, I recommend volunteering for vegan organizations, farm sanctuaries and joining local meetups! 🖤 Don't get me wrong, I love my friends, vegan or not! It has never been a requirement that my friends be vegan, but it definitely can be isolating when your worldview does not align with the people around you. So to anyone else who feels that isolation, just know that I see you, I hear you and you are not alone 🖤
user_15;user_15181.jpg;☀️Summer Bucket List: 🖤 Sew my own cutlery wraps 🖤 Go to @stjacobsmarket 🖤 Visit @terrebleu lavender farms! 🖤 Unpack our house from garbage bags because we haven't seen any bed bugs for a week! Fingers crossed that they are finally gone! 🖤 Host our first housewarming/summer BBQ 🖤 Gym 2-3x a week 🖤 Go to Buffalo for @wnyvegfest ! 🖤 Go camping?????? ☀️ We've got about a month left and lots of work to catch up on, but here is what I'm hoping to do before busy Veg Fest season in the fall! What are some of your Summer bucket list things?! ☀️ Pictured is my dinner with my mom at Little Asia: Nasi goreng, no egg, laksa, no egg, and tempeh satay. 10/10 suh good! ☀️ #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15182.jpg;I'm a simple gal with simple needs 👌 good food, good friends, good times. I try to take a moment to be thankful for the good I have in my life because life is too short to dwell on the things we coulda shoulda woulda done. 🌿 It's not the most beautiful picture, but trying to ease up on stressing about the quality of photos and just focus on sharing life! Massaged kale salad with @love.legrand chimichurri (gifted in PR), tomatoes, and buffalo soy curls (bought in bulk at @zerowastebulk)! A little lemon juice on the kale to brighten her up! Massaged kale is so much easier to eat and chew than regular kale :) 🌿 #user_15 #whatveganseat #eatmoreproduce #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15183.jpg;I don't often branch out of my usual faves, but I was in the Junction the other day and got to visit @grasshopper.eats!  My kale caesar was kind of just okay, the kale was like that tough wilted massage where it's hard to chew through, and they ran out of croutons :( @lfrae got the thai noodle bowl which she really enjoyed and she said the tempeh on it was super good! Had it not been for the cashews I would have tried some but I didn't want to risk it.  We split the popcorn nuggets and the kimchi fries and those alone were 10/10!! So so good, would honestly just come again just for these!! At one point, they had dan dan noodles on the menu but I never got to try it. It's not on their menu anymore and I am sad I never got to try it. Did any of you? How was it?! #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15184.jpg;MFW when what I order some shaved ice and what arrives is 3x the size I expected 😲  I had some dairy-free shaved ice from @meetfreshontario (order with no condensed milk and no ice cream) and it was tasty! Literally just like ice and sugar syrup with fruit, but actually so refreshing haha. Definitely would recommend sharing with 3+ people because this was HUGE. 🍧 I've been meaning to try this place for a while and next time I'm definitely gonna bring my own sweetened condensed milk and maybe even my own coffee creamer so I can try some of the other grass jelly desserts but veganized 😅 🍧 #whatveganseat #user_15
user_15;user_15185.jpg;🍔🍟👯‍♀️✨ Food is food, bodies are bodies. We all come in different shapes and sizes and are on our own journeys. I am grateful to my friends who accept me for who I am and not because I do or don't look a certain way.  We all start somewhere, and we all have our own struggles. I've had so many DMs from you sharing your stories of your struggles and your amazing path to overcome them. You are all such amazing beautiful people and I am so thankful to be able to be a positive part of your lives.  Thank you for sharing yourselves with me 💕 it really means a lot.  Here was my dinner from last night because I am not giving people the power to influence how I eat or look anymore. I enjoyed the heck out of my buffalo unchicken burger, fries supremacy, shiitake fried clams and a couple Arnold Palmers with great people ✨  Hope you are all having a wonderful weekend with people who empower you and make you feel rad.  #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare @hogtownvegan
user_15;user_15186.jpg;New video is a little late but yo girl is sick and burnt out for pretty much no reason 😪 so trying to just rest up and kick this sinus cold in the butt because I miss breathing through my nose. 🖤 Healing up with some VEGAN SPAGHETTIOS! Actually it's more alphabet soup but with anelli spaghettio noodles but same same but different. I like this ratio better anyway, but for a more traditional spaghettio to sauce ratio I'd double the noodle amount from my original recipe. 🖤 I'll leave a link for the recipe in the highlights and bio for y'all! I was vibing some super weird energy and I always feel bad about it but y'all seem to like it so HERE IT IS 😂 hope your weekend is fab! I'm going to @tasteofvietnamtoronto tonight and hopefully there will be vegan options!! Otherwise I'll just be going to @saigonlotustoronto after! 🍜 🖤 #user_15recipes #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #letscookvegan http://bit.ly/2Z0XInB
user_15;user_15187.jpg;[ad] I teased this recipe ages ago but it's finally live over on @producemadesimple! Using the juicy sweetness of Ontario grape tomatoes to turn into a savoury cobbler that can be either a savoury dessert or a delicious side dish. 🖤 There's something about herbaceous, fluffy biscuit and a jammy tomato layer that just makes this unconventional combination so tasty! It is the ultimate summer baked good (aside from a sweet cobbler of course 😁) 🖤 Head on over to ProduceMadeSimple.ca for the recipe and I'll leave it linked in the bio and highlights for you too 🤗 🖤 #user_15 #user_15recipes #producemadesimple #eatmoreproduce #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare http://bit.ly/2keWshr
user_15;user_15188.jpg;This was our dinner last week, but I've been loving the summer meals outside in our tiny, shitty backyard with our super ugly budget sunroof that doesn't fit our frame properly but hey, it provides shade so who am I to question it? 🖤 Beyond sausages with leftover OJ from our wedding and a big ol salad because I couldn't justify just eating sausages 😂 green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, and a chermoula/mayo dressing to use up the rest of my chermoula from my flatbread post for @sabra a couple weeks ago. Some pickles we picked up from @mustardseedcoop and it was a perfect lil backyard dinner! 🖤 Hopefully will be doing some nice BBQ this weekend, I want to try making sunflower cheese and stuffing some mushrooms with it 😈 Eddie doesn't like mushrooms though so I need help eating it 😂 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganbbq #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15189.jpg;You asked for a noodle taste test, so that's what we did! 28 minutes of a taste test mukbang on Eddie's vegan story because so many of you were curious as to how and why he went vegan! 🖤 A bunch or you asked how to get your partners to go vegan too and we share our experience with that whole thing in the long AF video as well 😅 i'll put the link in the highlights and in the bio feed as well. 🖤 Big shoutout to @itslizmiu for all these NOODS! Definitely check out our snack swap to see all the goodies she sent, all on the channel as well. 🖤 #user_15 #user_15recipes #whatveganseat #whyimvegan #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare  https://youtu.be/KVpqCaj23lM
user_15;user_15190.jpg;I still can't believe this day has come and gone! Now that it's over I am just so grateful to not have this huge event to plan haha. Married life so far has been pretty much the same, but it's been interesting seeing how people navigate the whole aspect of last name changes (or not—for us), how I still call Eddie my partner (and some people, even in the LGBTQ+ space ignore me and call him my boyfriend??) 🖤 It's weird and awkward but has been interesting for me to observe. Been editing a video today, it's not going as fast as I would like but hopefully going to post a noodle mukbang with Edward's vegan story for you tomorrow! In the meantime, here is my favourite picture from our wedding 😍 more pics on @lisalovesleaves because I got all my spam out on there haha. 🖤 Eagerly waiting for the video from @codymturner eventually so I can share the day with you guys! For now, I find myself just scrolling through the pictures from the day saved on my phone because all the people I love in these photos are just so dang beautiful and great. It's a major feels good 💕 🖤 Hope you are all having a lovely Tuesday. Yes I know I already posted today but I was just too excited and I wanted to share 😁 📸: @codymturner #user_15 #veganwedding #whatveganslooklike
user_15;user_15191.jpg;I was feeling tacos last weekend and Eddie and I found vegan options at @mezcaltnt in Hamilton! They had 3 vegetarian options that they made vegan for us and the server was super knowledgeable and the kitchen was really accommodating! 🖤 I got one of each kind for 18$, there was a squash and kale taco, a deep fried artichoke one, and a fried cauliflower one. One typically has a honey based vinaigrette and a couple have queso or cojita cheese on it, but they double checked with us on honey (no thank you), and took care of the rest! So delicious!! 🖤 My favourite was the artichoke one, I don't know how they did it but the flaky texture and flavours they used almost made it kind of fishy? But in a great way! The squash and kale was really flavourful and texturewise it was softer but still REALLY good, and the fried cauliflower was Eddie's favourite because it had a really great bite to it. 🖤 Normally taco places just do beans (which is fine, I love beans) but it was so nice to have really innovative and well thought out veggie tacos that are delicious in their own right! Highly recommend :) 9/10 would eat again! 🖤 #user_15 #hamiltonvegan #hamiltonontario #veganfoodshare #bestofvegan #whatveganseat
user_15;user_15192.jpg;Hi hello I took a bit of a break because my eczema exploded post-wedding stress and also I got nutted (someone served me a drink with almond milk instead of soy) so been recovering! These tacos and fries are from my weekend day trip with @janellecarpenter to #kwvegfest! Had some @beertownpublic afterwards and took full advantage of their separate vegan menu! 🖤 I tried the tacos this time made with a faux chicken and they were super tasty! Their rosemary truffle fries are delicious and the Caesar in the last pic is from another time I went to Beertown with Eddie when we were running errands in Waterloo. 🖤 Last week, I took the week off work after the wedding to hang with Edward and try to get our house in order again. We are still only halfway back to normal but the week to heal and rest up and just hang out was blissful. We couldn't afford a honeymoon so we just did a lil staycation and are hoping to do a mini-moon to Montreal later this summer after @fvmtl! 🖤 Still kind of a weird Monday because I only had time to work a little bit this morning, but trying to catch up on life stuff that we put off until after the wedding. Trying out a new gym after moving and getting some new glasses for the first time in 3 years because I am finally under Eddie's insurance :D 🖤 Hoping to be productive this week! Hope y'all are having an equally energizing Monday ✨ #user_15 #veganfoodshare #beertownpublic
user_15;user_15193.jpg;The backlog of posts from before the wedding is still here haha. Last week I was too exhausted to cook so we went to @lotus_cuisine in Stoney Creek for dinner and I got these drunken noodles! Eddie got a sweet and sour stir fry. 🖤 It was pretty good! There are a lot of options, but depending on the server, they may or may not be super confident in how vegan your dish is haha. The menu is a little confusing as to what can be made vegan or not (it's just a bit inconsistent), but as long as you clarify that vegan means no egg, no chicken broth, no oyster sauce or fish sauce, you should be covered. 🖤 Those are the typically the culprits in Asian cuisine for sneaky non-vegan ingredients but they have really tasty tofu and are very friendly when you are double checking :) 🖤 #user_15 #hamiltonontario #hamiltonvegan #veganfoodshare
user_15;user_15194.jpg;Post-wedding brunch at @saigonlotustoronto, Lisa & Eddie style (but mostly Eddie indulging Lisa). I needed some hot & spicy soup to make me even sweatier and soothe my sore throat after partying it up on Friday!  It is Canada Day where I am, and while I am grateful to live in a country where we have reproductive rights and respectively better human rights than many other places in the world, it is definitely not a perfect country. We have a horrific history of Indigenous genocide, for which Canada is still behind in reparations today.  Please take time to acknowledge that we live on lands taken by force. Support indigenous businesses, organizations, artists and people whenever you can. I'm definitely not an expert and need to do more research on ways to support First Nations in Canada, but I'll leave a link in the bio to some Indigenous non-profits you can support :) https://www.animikii.com/news/7-indigenous-non-profits-to-check-out-this-givingtuesday #indigenousrights #user_15recipes (this is so the link shows up lol) #canadaday
user_15;user_15195.jpg;Got some preview photos from the amazing @codymturner 💕 it was one heck of a magical blur and I felt like an elven princess. Eddie made everyone cry with his vows and literally swept me off my feet 💕  I am pretty sure I'm sick now because of the post-stress fallout, so I'm gonna take it easy for the next couple days! I'm going to write a big blog post about the day while it's still fresh in my brain but not today haha.  There are so many people who made this day possible and we are so thankful to have such wonderful people come celebrate with us. We felt so loved 🖤 V E N D O R S 🖤 💄: @flower.artistry 💍: @ftjco 👰: @kymsaodai 🌹: @floralandbrick 🍝: @urbanacornca 🍰: @jennascakesncupcakes 🍩: @beechwooddoughnuts 📸: @codymturner & @jessicawalfordphoto 🎧: Energy Productions 🏫: Heintzman House  #nerdsgetmarried #user_15 #veganwedding
user_15;user_15196.jpg;Nothing quite gives me joy like donuts do! The wonderful humans behind @zerowastebulk occasionally makes vegan donuts (@zwbdonuts) and Ellin made TARO donuts and she graciously saved me one because she inevitably sold out of them before I even left my house today haha. 🖤 They are gorgeous and delicious cake donuts and these taro ones were wonderfully subtle with taro flavour in the icing and the filling on top was my sweet taro paste dream come to life! EDIT: Apparently the icing was just coconut but I swear it tasted like taro lol. 🖤 Been running tons of last minute errands for the wedding and it's looking like it's gonna thunderstorm on our wedding day, but y'know what?! I HAVE NO F*&KS LEFT 😂⛈️ I can't wait to eat some delicious food from @urbanacornca, see my beautiful friends, wear my dress, marry my dude and eat some @beechwooddoughnuts. And that's all folks. 🖤 My brain is dead from all the logistics, meetings, errands, and phone calls but we are almost at the finish line! I am so grateful to the people who have pulled together around me to support me through this process and listen to me gripe about drama and wedding things. But I am very excited for this all to pass haha. 🖤 Did anyone else feel this way? I know I'm exhausted from all the mental gymnastics from planning this wedding, but in the end, I truly am so grateful for the privilege of openly marrying the person I love without society judging me (although I do get the occasional racist comment online). 🖤 Anywho, a lot of emotions swimming through my head, and I'm really looking forward to just being married. Would love to hear about your wedding woes, past or present, for solidarity and the reassurance that I'm not losing it 😂 🖤 #user_15 #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #zerowastebulk
user_15;user_15197.jpg;Been trying to get outside more often and just taking walks with Eddie whenever we have the chance. Our neighbourhood is beautiful and family friendly, it's so wonderful to love the neighbourhood you're in! 🖤 Our walks typically happen after dinner and while we nom on some chocolate dairy-free @magnum bars and they are 10/10, my chocolate ice cream bar dreams. WHAT A TIME TO BE VEGAN! 🖤 Just to update y'all, I'm hoping to have a What I Eat In A Day vlog out this week, but we are still dealing with bed bug treatment on top of trying to get all the last minute stuff for the wedding done, so y'know, this sensitive weirdo is overstimulated this week. But next week, it'll be time to fully reset and pick up projects I had been putting on the backburner for a while (like that banh xèo recipe haha. I did buy coconut Lacroix for it!) 🖤 Hope all of you are having a nice start to your week. Highly suggest having a walk and some vegan ice cream to end your day later today 😁🍦😁
user_15;user_15198.jpg;🚨VEGAN BRUNCH ALERT🚨  Maybe I was ravenous after a 2 hour hike, and maybe I am dealing with PMS right now (SO thankful my cycle is hitting me now and not during my wedding), but @beertownpublic blew me away with their vegan options with an impressive vegan brunch menu!! 🖤 I got the Vegan Carolina Fried Chick'n Sandwich and vegan Caesar salad and 10/10 every dang thing was delicious. The chick'n I'm pretty sure is Gardein, but it's battered in a really light, almost fish & chips style batter and the bun is airy and chewy and the perfect vessel for the chick'n, butter pickles and aioli. 🖤 The Caesar salad is generously dressed with a really tasty and creamy dressing with bagel croutons! So fun. And of course, I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a vegan Caesar. What a flavoursome meal after a really great hike. 🖤 Now I'm off to send some long overdue emails to our wedding guests to tell them the timeline of our day haha. Hope you are all having a wonderful end of your weekend ☀️ 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #beertown #beertownpublic #burlington
user_15;user_15199.jpg;You know what's better than vegan grilled cheese? Loaded grilled cheese made with naan bread (thanks to opening my eyes to the possibility of naan grilled cheese @twomarketgirls, their recipe coming next month!) 🖤 While my friends have been indulging in the amazing, delicious foods at @eatdrinkvegan, I'm home, planning my wedding and fielding drama and event planning minutiae. So sometimes ya gotta feed your brain and just take a minute to eat. 🖤 I slathered vegan butter on some garlic naan from the grocery store (not all of them are vegan, but you might luck out and find a dairy-free naan bread!), added @followyourheart cheddar, @yvesveggiecuisine bologna slices and a happy layer of spinach! Cook on each buttered side on medium heat, covered, flipping once each side is browned😍 🖤 #user_15 #whatveganseat #veganfoodshare #letscookvegan
