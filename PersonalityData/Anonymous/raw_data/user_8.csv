user_8;user_81.jpg;Qarantine Curves ✨ My favourite part of being a woman is our innate ability to adapt. Our very existence, our physiology and cellular make-up is designed wondrously to not only curve gracefully through the physical realm, but also to swim with fluidity, bending with feline flexibility around the multitude of challenges we are given to grow through 🦋 Just as the moon shines with radiant magnificence through her every shape, may you too learn to love yourself irrespective of the phase you are blessed to embody. #writtenbysjana (Yes I am aware that I am not a deliciously “curvy” woman, but I am proud of my body regardless of what she looks like in any moment. And at the moment, she feels more feminine and full and enriched and I enjoy it) 🌻
user_8;user_82.jpg;This is a reminder to be gentle with yourself 💛
user_8;user_83.jpg;I remember first hearing about Ubuntu when I was much much younger, and it JUST MADE SENSE. Ubuntu means “I am, because we are”. There is no seperation between you and I. Him and her. Her and it. It and I. We are all interconnected, united and bonded both by energy and spirit. I am no different from the earth I walk on. Nor the clouds that float above. Your pain is our pain. And my success is your success. But I can’t help but take a seat as the witness and watch as we (myself included - I am in no way seperate or superior to the collective and even my personal decisions and actions are not as wholesome, sustainable or conscious as they could/should be!) Continue to resist the very thing that will help to heal us.  I’ve found myself pondering this question a lot lately: “When I die, will this matter”. If it’s a no, then I choose to let it go. And if it’s a yes, then I know in my entire being that I have no choice but to move in to it. I am confronted by so many aspects of myself I’m not proud of. So many little hidden pockets i’ve filled with weights and then wonder why it’s hard to swim. And in these moments, I find I have forgotten. I’ve forgotten what it means to be here, and the importance of community, connection and what it feels like to move, breathe, speak and act from a place of unconditional love, gratitude and acceptance. I’ve forgotten that it’s “We” not “me”. I pray that as we step in to the new age, we move forward, together. May we hold hands, and progress toward the collective truth. May there be integration, not seperation. May we be helping not hurting. May we give and give and give, And remove the illusion of superiority, come back to our hearts, and REMEMBER why we are all here, sharing this experience, together. May we be kind, compassionate, warm, understanding. May we selflessly act, and may our every thought, word and action be birthed from the womb of unconditional love. May we right our wrongs, forgive and forgive again. May we remove the ego in order to unlearn, learn, integrate, grow, empower, heal, connect and rebirth only to do it again, and again. Until all that is left, is “Ubuntu” ❤️ #writtenbysjana

user_8;user_811.jpg;This is not my post. I found it through @finnharries and the art work/post is originally by @courtneyahndesign 🙌🏻. Originally I had shared an artwork saying “black lives matter”. Then I saw so many people saying “all lives matter” and thought “well that’s against the point”. But gave in to other peoples opinions and changed it. Now, I accept my fault, and choosing to share my lesson. I am a white female. I am an example of what it means to have white privilege. Not intentionally. And not by choice. But it is there nevertheless. I have always known and been taught that everyone is equal and valid and important regardless of their skin colour, demographic, religion, race, culture, sex etc. human is human, and love is love and we are ALL made divinely. And although I grew up being told about racism, I never understood it properly because it wasn’t a part of my reality. I am sorry for my ignorance. I am sorry. I can now see that there is a huge difference between being “not racist” and being “actively anti-racist”. I am not proud of my lack of action. I don’t know the right way to approach this. And I am terrified I’ll do it wrong and say the wrong thing. Because I KNOW that this matters. But that is exactly why I SHOULD speak to the issue rather than avoid it. Racism is not just a part of “2020”. It’s not something we will just “get over”. It has been present for MANY GENERATIONS! and not just in America, but internationally, even in my own country Australia. And it is NOT OKAY. But I don’t know how to help. Teach me. Guide me. Show me how to help heal the terrible wrongs that have happened. Tell me what I can do to be proactive in this battle. I know my apologies, OUR apologies will never be enough. But I am a student of this world, and open to receiving the lessons I need to learn, in order for this existence to be a kinder, more welcoming and accepting place for us all. I am deeply sorry, for any time, and every time I could have or should have done more, been louder or more vocal. I am learning. Please forgive me ❤️

user_8;user_820.jpg;“Our one true Mother tongue is the language of the body” ✨ When was the last time you gave yourself permission to feel good? I mean, REALLY good? The last time you felt not only comfortable in your skin, but also desirable to yourself? The last time you understood your own value, beauty and strength. Then understood that all that passion & power was alive inside of your body. And that same skin, was also uniquely beautiful, divine even, and worthy of receiving P L E A S U R E . Begin to notice where you are, what part of yourself you’re embodying and what you’re doing the next time you step in to that “inner Goddess” (or God!) and take note of the things that turn you on, and the things that turn you off. I’m not just talking about sexually either. Intimacy and eroticism is so much more than just the physical components. It’s about your energy, your life force your ability to be intellectually challenged and cognitively stimulated. What is intimacy to you? What is the experience of true intimacy like? Is it powerful? Playful? Is it a place to surrender and abandon parts of yourself? A space to be adventurous and curious? Is it creative? What is the language that you use within experiencing and exploring your own intimacy? ♏️ Words inspired by the podcast I listened to today... I linked it in my stories if you want to listen.

user_8;user_824.jpg;Tag that friend(s). 🦋 (or just tag some women in your life who inspire you to no end!) Then also tag yourself. Seriously, do it 🙌🏻 And if you find it hard to do that, or to accept that maybe this is the truth, then this is for you ESPECIALLY! Women, it’s time we start treating eachother, and ourselves, with more compassion, humility, understanding, empathy, love and support. Rather than looking at someone and wanting what they have, or overflowing with envy, may we be audible with our affections. May be voice our admirations whilst simultaneously praising the same potential, the same Goddess that resides within our own beings. We are countless different formations of the same matter and magic. Recognising someone elses light doesn’t dim our own. Just like following someone elses light, will never lead us home ❤️ Repost @hara_thelabel - loved the post so had to share, but also genuinely love this brand and their ethos!

user_8;user_826.jpg;"“I had a dream last night that I was made of water. I was one with the sea, the clouds, the creeks and ponds. I was a whispering wave, a raging river and a silken snowflake. I was ever-present, and yet I sat still in peaceful presence and listened and watched as the world around me continued to flow. I heard the heartfelt conversations of my friends; letters of the soul. I watched in awe as they laughed, and danced through the years. Some got married, some had children, others travelled to distant lands and howled beneath starlight skies and bathed in lunar light. I felt it all too. I felt their pleasures, their pain, their hardships and triumphs. I felt their energy rippling through my being and bubbling up from within. When I woke, I forgot to breathe. And for a few seconds, I was convinced I didn’t need to. For I wasn’t a being submerged within wetness, I was the wetness surrounding the submerged.” #writtenbysjana I’ve had a hard time breathing all day actually. My lungs feel weak and tight, my ribcage too full of emotions for my lungs to expand. I wasn’t drowning beneath the surface, but I’m choking on this air."

user_8;user_837.jpg;Hey there my fellow earth babies 💛 Just checking in to see how everyone is. Sending a warm virtual hug should anyone who is needing it and a reminder to remain soft and open hearted during these trialling times. Here’s a little something I wrote this afternoon and wanted to share 💛 Relevance of the video? Absolutely none. I just liked how my hair felt and wanted it documented 😂 • “Now is not a challenge, it is an opportunity to honour the many archetypes that live within each of us. To respect, forgive and LISTEN to the innate knowledge and knowingness we are remembering, and to continue trusting our own unique,messy, divine path. Each moment is not “unfolding” as much as it is aligning in perfect synchronisity that is necessary for our personal evolution. This is a reminder of the immense power in our ability to surrender, and the strength it takes to let go of that which does not support our constant and continual transformation. “ - The inevitability of becoming a butterfly #writtenbysjana #isolationthings #sharethehappy #sunshinestateofmind #hairgoals #curlyhair #sunshine
user_8;user_838.jpg;The next time you find yourself on your mat, and doing heart openers or back bends (particularly bridge & wheel pose or variations) I encourge you to find conscious and intentional stillness after you release. I like to come down on to my back, keep the spine lengthened and knock the knees in together or lay in supta baddha konasana (souls of the feet together, knees splayed out to either side of the room) and take one hand to my heart space and the other to my belly. I close down my eyes and enjoy feeling the benefits of the heart opener move through me, and with the breath. There is a sense of surreal and sensual pleasure in the moments after a heart opener. And I often can’t help but smile inside and out 💛 •  #workoutathome #yoga #yogaathome #fitness
user_8;user_839.jpg;Self massage has become an integral part of my self-care routine. I am a hugger. That is how i’ve defined myself for years now. I identify with it so strongly because it is the way I show, give and feel love, acceptance and appreciation. I put my heart against someone elses heart, wrap my arms around their body and soul, and we breathe together for a while. To me, that’s the ultimate “hello”, “thank you”, “I need you”, “I see you”, “it’ll be okay”. Hugs to me, are their own language. Hugs say the things that sometimes the mouth struggles to put words to. Hugs know that sometimes a hug doesn’t need to say anything, it just is. And not being able to hug at these times, social distancing from everyone except the three people in my household is HARD. I’m doing it because I know it is caring for others and the global collective, but it is hard on a soul level. So, i’ve been hugging myself. Hugging myself emotionally, cognitively & spiritually (self pep talks, journalling, meditations reading and mindfulness), physically (I have a crescent-shaped hug-pillow I sleep with, yoga, exercise, self massage) and literally (yeah I have even been literally wrapping my arms around myself and giving myself a hug. It seems small, but it is these little things that are keeping me sane right now. 💛 Other things that help me: routine (maintaining a normal sleep/wake/work schedule), sunshine (vit D), getting in the ocean (only for a surf or workout swim as we aren’t allowed to hang around at the beach anymore), variety (spicing things up and trying new things), finding balance between being productive, and doing nothing and being okay with not achieving anything other than eating and brushing my teeth that day) What feels like a self-hug to you? P.S if you’re not sure what self-massage is or looks like, head over to my website (link in bio) and I have a completely free guided self massage under the tab “Yoga” and then “The Retreat Yourself Series” xx #selflove #quarantine #workoutathome #workinathome

My rational self, and even spiritual body, KNOWS that this is requiredof me in order to discover and RE-discover growth and soul progression. I’m not as comfortable surfing as I was when I was younger - I stopped doing it for a while and lost my confidence. Am I a pro surfer? Hells to the no. But do I enjoy getting salty, and wobbling my way across waves? Hells YES! 🤗 I control SO many other aspects of my life, even down to my yoga practice, I am in FULL control over my body and know what it is doing, and how to move and adjust it. Surfing, i’m like a log trying to wiggle, or a wiggle trying to log 😂 And part of me LOVES giving up the need to control, surrendering and just chilllllliinnnngggg

user_8;user_861.jpg;"When it is time for change, the Universe will make it so uncomfortable that it will become near impossible for the same dysfunctional patterns to continue repeating. Shifts, changes and challenges will demand to be felt and heard, as a desperate attempt to wake ourselves up and shake us from our own disorder. When the limited ways of human kind have reached their limits, when we are on the borderline of exhausting all our resources, tiring all our solutions, we will see not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new reality. Our old ways of existence have become unsustainable. We are currently at a cross-roads. We can choose to remain in a limiting headspace - believing this moment in time, these challenges are simply coincidental. Or we can open our minds and realise the truth; the sheer inevitability of this divine unfolding. This is not happening to us necessarily, it is simply happening. We can accept this, and utilise this as an opportunity to evolve and transcend. Or we can struggle through, attempting to maintain our attachment to old habits and ways. A radical shift (personally, collectively, and even globally) is necessary, and it is here, knocking at our doors. What happens next, is up to you ✨#writtenbysjana"
user_8;user_862.jpg;Self Isolation = solo dance parties 👌🏻 Secondly, Our words vibrate an energy all of their own, we should be more careful of the sounds we communicate and share with this world. I don’t think we should be “social distancing”. We should be practicing “Physical distancing” or “positional awareness”, yes. Either intentionally decreasing, limiting or stopping your exposure, to protect not only yourself but to keep in mind the concern of other peoples welbeing. It’s times like these where the unfolding of scenarios that are consuming and out of our immediate control, the last thing we should be doing is creating seperation between souls and loosening the connection that weaves the whole of humanity 💛 @saltatshoalbay
user_8;user_863.jpg;I realise in times like these, when we are forced to veer from our regular realities, our known habits, and ways of life, that what is needed is also the very thing that can seem most challenging. When we are forced to disconnect, what we really need is to reconnect and look within. Or at least, that’s what it feels like for me. What do you think? I’ve made a quick little poll on my stories for some feedback - i’d love to hear your opinion and to see how you’re going! If you have time, (and maybe time is all you have at the moment!) it’d be great to hear your perspective. Drop in to my stories and let me know how you’re dealing, and what could make this time better for you as an individual and as a community! 💛💛
user_8;user_864.jpg;When this ends, and it WILL end. I can only pray we remember and embody the lessons we are currently learning. May we treat others with the same kindness, give them the same empathy and stand together with the same solidarity. When this ends, and we can once again embrace, touch and connect, May we embrace one anothers peculiarities as well as their bodies. May we touch one anothers hearts, not just their hands. May we connect to each others souls, not each others wifi. For as confronting and overwhelming as this all is, there is no denying it is proving to be a powerful period of growth and collective education about why our old patterns are no longer sustainable. I can only pray we remember and embody these lessons we are currently learning. #writtenbysjana 📷: @samearp

user_8;user_866.jpg;Some words laced with sunshine for your day ✨ I have seen this soo many times on my friends stories, and it rings so true, and is something I think we could all benefit from reading, again and again ❤️ So here is a little reminder for you. Hopefully a handful of the weight has started to lift in your part of the world. I hope you are experiencing and witnessing the softness and warmth humanity can generate, and this will only make us more wise, open and conscious as an entire race. I like to see the good in situations, and maybe i’m too much of an optimist, but I can see a clearing in the not so distant future and am confident that this bizarre situation will make us stronger ❤️ Rather than talking about how scary this time is, Try to focus your energy on the abundance of stories emerging of human goodness and the random kindness you’ve seen or heard. ❤️ This one is reposted from @ashleymfreeman 🦋
user_8;user_867.jpg;"“We are all just star-shine wrapped in human skin, and the light that we are looking for, has always been within."" Beauty is about feeling comfortable and confident in your skin. Beauty is not the way we look, it's the way we think of and speak to ourselves.  Enter, two of my new @biossance products! 🙂 (All vegan, clean, non toxic, sustainable, conscious, recyclable, renewable and made with intention!) The Squalane + Marine Algae Eye Cream (the best hack for tired eyes, to firm, settle and rejuvenate!) and the Squalane + Rose Vegan Lip Balm (my daily go-to for hydration, softness and lip lushness!) My thoughts on beauty, as well as my beauty routine, have changed significantly over the last few years. And now, more than ever, I truly believe in the importance of embracing CLEAN beauty.  Take a look at your skincare and beauty products. Do you know what is in them? Do you know where their ingredients are sourced or come from? Are they good for you? Good for the planet? Good for your soul? What brands are you choosing to support? What do these brands stand for?  Become aware, of the power you possess through your purchasing. And maybe explore within yourself if there are any ways in which you could invite lighter living.  Once you become conscious to your actions and the effects they have, it is hard to become unconscious again.  I now choose to only invest in and support brands, products and organizations that I know are doing their part for the planet.  What are you choosing?

user_8;user_875.jpg;"“What do i do now?” He asked. “What do you do now? You do what you’ve always done. You wake up, brush your teeth, smile at yourself and do what needs to be done. You give yourself time to heal, and space to feel. You trust the divine process, and witness a world of emotions moving through you. You cry, you break, you fold. You laugh, you build, you seek. You release the illusion and realise that you actually haven’t lost anything. All you lost was the idea of a life with that person. You lost the concept of them; a portrayal. Your belief or hope was shattered only in your mind. But you cannot lose something you never had. Something that was never destined to be yours. This impermanence is both a brilliant blessing and a burly burden.” #writtenbysjana Pic by @eastonschirra"
user_8;user_876.jpg;"Hey soul family 🦋 I just wanted to get on here and express a message from my heart to yours. The whole reason I teach yoga, is because of my own personal experience with it, and the way it has helped me to grow, learn, HEAL and ultimately shaped me in to the soul I am today. My favourite part of this job is being able to connect to YOU so vulnerably, openly and deeply. I’ve found the way to do this is through transformational retreats - I make myself 100% available and present for you on my retreats, and they aren’t just a week of yoga in pretty places. They are truly sacred experiences; opportunities for true transformation and personal evolution. If you are drawn to a retreat, it isn’t by coincidence. It is the Universe redirecting you and gently steering you in her own divine way. If you are interested or curious about learning more, please head over to my stories and I will share a link there to join a chat dedicated and devoted to informing you about an unrivalled opportunity to join myself and @skybearb on a journey of the soul at our Evolve Retreat (Deep healing, yoga, transcendental breathwork, meditation, wholesome food, and once-in-a-lifetime experiences) in the Dominican Republic this August 10-16th.

user_8;user_882.jpg;How often do you take the time to acknowledge your inner Goddess? How often do you talk to her? Does she speak back? And do you listen? What does she say? • I am continually re-learning the immense power of the being I am. Each day I am unlacing a tight knot from the illusion of the “self” I once saw as reality, further unlocking the wisdom buried in my bones. • You see, I am not this shell I wear. I am not my name, my gender, my age, my race, my religion (or lack thereof). I am not good, nor bad, wrong nor right. “I” don’t exist at all. My soul is the energy that is interlaced between all hearts. The same energy that weaves valleys and oceans, the spirit of all that was, all that is and all that is destined to be. I am the sea breeze, the first bud in Spring and the empty moon that bleeds. I am the knowledge I knew, that which I did not, and the Universal awareness of our collective Ancestors. I both lack existence, yet am that of omnipresence. My actuality, lacks a solid reality. Yet I have never felt so certain of my purpose. #writtenbysjana Pic by 📷 eastonschirra

user_8;user_885.jpg;I had a dream last night. I had that a dream that I kissed you. Waist deep in saltwater, you kissed me back. You kissed me so deeply, so passionately, so intensely. As if tasting my lips was more necessary than breathing. As if your frame would collapse if I weren’t holding it against me. Every inch of my body pressed against the silken skin of yours, Every cell inside me madly, irrevocably in love with you. That same familiar, overwhelming feeling of falling, uncontrollably. Nothing else mattered. Nothing else existed. Just the pulsing space between our forbidden touch. You took my breath away. And now, I’m taking it back. #writtenbysjana

user_8;user_898.jpg;One day, This. Will. All. Make. Sense. 🦋 But right now, isn’t one day. It’s today. And today, it’s okay to feel and express. Your mind may want to rationalise things, think optimistically, justify or forgive in order to heal. And that’s beautiful. But of equal importance, is recognising that the heart is also valid, and when she is bleeding - when she is hurting and weeping, when she shatters, it is OKAY to immerse yourself in the depths of her pain. It is okay to surrender and to sit with the vulnerability of your feelings. It is OKAY to experience anger, sadness and loss. It is okay to taste every part of this human experience. It is okay to withdraw, curl up and cry. Spin yourself a cocoon of the things that make your soul shine, And sit with them here until you are ready for your rebirth. ✨🦋 #writtenbysjana P.S sneak peek of something new and exciting coming SOON with @loganhollowell ✨ • And yes, fun fact: one of my eyes is slightly lighter than the other
user_8;user_899.jpg;Self Pleasure Is Self Empowerment. Where are you, who are you with, what are you doing and what does it FEEL like internally when you experience pure pleasure? And how many kinds of pleasure can you identify experiencing? (Note: Not all pleasure needs to be sensual, it can be primal, innate, soothing, softening, divine, controlled or even uncontrolled/surprise).
user_8;user_8100.jpg;I open my heart and invite you to join me for my The Art Of Surrender” yoga retreat ✨ In GREECE! September 6-12th 2020 • A 7 day journey of the self, through the self and to the self. Unfolding, and unearthing your shadows. Acknowledging and accepting your truths, growing through your limitations and expanding in your innate and divine personal power. A week of transformational shifts, and connecting deeper to your inner self. There will be daily yoga classes, a couple of workshops, time for leisure and relaxation, boat trips and island hopping across some of Greeces' most beautiful blue waters, and space to unfold completely. All your meals and activities will be arranged for you, so this is your opportunity to release control, and SURRENDER. 💛  Link is in my bio for more info! (Or go to my stories) x
user_8;user_8101.jpg;Grief doesn’t follow a formula. It isn’t an emotion, or at least not as we know it. It’s the process of healing - It’s the hearts way of mending itself. One second you can be attempting to contain joy within your limbs and trying not to smile so wide your cheeks hurt. And the very next your heart feels shredded, the air is too thick to breathe and the earth fails to hold your fragile figure. There is no way to predict the process, So instead, it’s best to surrender. Give yourself permission to feel through each phase, with acceptance and gratitude. For I know that right now, the ability to feel so intensely seems like a burden. But I promise you, it will one day be your biggest blessing. #writtenbysjana
user_8;user_8102.jpg;Perfectionism isn’t a trait that we possess. It’s an expression of the fear that we feel. It’s the mental control we seek. A worry not of experiencing the imperfect, but of being overwhelmed by our wild capability. #writtenbysjana

user_8;user_8106.jpg;Is gratitude a form of prayer? Sure, our hands don’t always meet together at our heart, But our eyes do close, the corner edges of our lips can lift and we do sometimes fall to our knees in deep veneration of that which we are experiencing. Our hearts and minds come together, and for even just a slight moment, we aren’t seeking for more, or wanting to be elsewhere. We look within, and feel the presence of something greater. For a fleeting second, we can stand tall, breathe freely and observe the vast magnificence of this impermanent human occurance. For a brief instant, we are both completely comprehendable, yet infinitely inexplicable. #writtenbysjana

And I’m a huge believer that the most immense change can be cultivated not from a handful of radicals doing everything perfectly, but instead by all of humanity uniting, coming together and creating countless small shifts that produce immeasurable change in the masses. Things like the clothes we wear on our bodies, slow fashion, supporting locals, knowing where your products come from and how they’re made, Reusable bags, waterbottles and keep cups, increasing your eco awareness, eating more from the earth, less from packets, choosing to buy from and therefore SUPPORT brands that are conscious and helping to heal our home planet, not hurt her. 💛  I’ll be frolocking around like an Earth Fairy if you need me 💛 @remilanedesigns

Thank you, for your impact. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your existence. Thank you for outlining my strengths and reflecting my vulnerabilities. Thank you for teaching me patience, and helping me to practice acceptance and unconditional forgiveness. Thank you for forcing me to evolve, over and over. Constant rebirth, constant growth.

user_8;user_8114.jpg;"Todays mood. I woke up feeling incredibly “BLAH” this morning. I got on my mat, put on some music, and cried myself through my yoga practice. I gave myself permission to be a mess, to embrace the intensity of emotions and to feel the weight of my heavy heart. There’s been a lot going on lately, both in the external world and my internal landscape. And truly FEELING was actually an honour, and I’m glad I was able to harness that opportunity for purification. Tears can be just that; the cleansing nature of an emotional release. I found myself confronted with a choice; To remain feeling sorry for myself, and to wallow in my emotions, or I could consciously decide to use the hurt I was experiencing as an opportunity for HEALING. So, that’s what I did. I cancelled a meeting I had in Sydney, I chose to avoid my emails and texts, and crafted my day by filling it with things that were self soothing, nurturing and respected my fragile state. I’m now going to bed with a lifted and light heart, a smile on my face, and gratitude pouring from the seams ❤️ Here’s a reminder to take care of yourself. And also to recognise the power of seemingly small, yet massively influential things that are good for our health, happiness and general welbeing. Ask yourself: “What can I do to do something nice for myself today?” Then give yourself the gift of actually doing it ✨"
user_8;user_8115.jpg;"If I listen closely, I can still hear your whispers; I can still hear your verbal vulnerabilities. We sat on a bed, and spoke about nothing important. Tiny details from our pasts; memories we’d thought we’d forgotten. Old pains and pleasures, current affairs, trials and tributes. It was nothing, yet it was everything. There was something indescribably intimate, about the way you uncloaked my insides. Completely innocent, yet dangerously sexy. #writtenbysjana"
user_8;user_8116.jpg;This is too important to ignore. Australia is BURNING!!! This has gone beyond a state of emergency, and beyond a national disaster. This is a humanitarian CRISIS!! • There has been 14.6 MILLION ACRES (6 MILLION HECTARES) burned since September, 2019. This is more than DOUBLE the 2019 Amazon Rainforest Fires! Over HALF A BILLION animals have already lost their lives from the fires, and it has not even begun to ease yet! Conditions are set to WORSEN. Our wildlife, land and people are in EXTREME danger. the animals who are surviving are severely injured, their paws are burned and they have been separated from their families. The death toll is expected to rise with dozens of people missing and many people already deceased. Tens of thousands of others are trapped, evacuated and either without or running out of water, food and resources. 350 MILLION METRIC TONS of CO2 have been emitted due to these fires, and have made the air smothering Sydney and Canberra 11 times more hazardous than the hazardous levels for human health, this smoke is and has been killing people. This Planet NEEDS change. If nothing else, please change your actions & think about the impact. Speak up, unite, support each other, support our PLANET! Australia needs help to be green again.

user_8;user_8124.jpg;Everyone is so hyped for a new decade, but i’m more excited for the upcoming solstice and new moon eclipse! I’m using the next couple of weeks as a period of transition, introspection and focus. Releasing old energy and patterning behaviours, to create space for growth and expansion. This next phase of my life seems very pivotal, and the recent months have felt like a total rebirth and as if complete shift has happened/is happening. And I’ve never felt more ready to elevate my life. I am consciously dedicating the new decade to SLOWING it down, existing from a place of radical ABUNDANCE, UNFOLDING my wings and GIVING back through acts of service and kindness, and by doing so, aligning with my DHARMA.

With something positive. “I am strong”, “I am boundless”, “I am blessed with infinite abundance and divine timing”, “I am a delight to be around and my joy is contagious”. Or if you honestly feel incapable of giving yourself a compliment, Just remove the negative, and repeat “I am”. “I am”. “I. AM”. #writtenbysjana

We are walking, talking, breathing miracles. Catalysed by and through love. • All my eco friendly tshirts are now available on my website (link is in my bio!) AND right in time for chrissy!!

user_8;user_8147.jpg;“Create beautiful places inside of yourself, then begin to expand and build outward” Bring on day 5 of my 300hr Yoga Teacher Training here in Ubud, Bali. I’m doing mine with @yoga_eastwest and I cannot even begin to explain how amazing this training is!!! (Or the internal shifts that have happened since getting here!)
user_8;user_8148.jpg;I am fierce femininity, I am wild vulnerability. I am raw love, And I am pure light. I am power and presence, I am truth and trust. I am divinely, masterfully and perfectly created. A being of knowledge, a seeker of insight. I am magic, I am mystery. I am unapolagetic in my existence. I am the ocean, And I am the sky. I am the sun, And I am the moon. For I exist within everything. And all that exists, exists within me. - WOMAN • #writtenbysjana • Pics by @loudawg_
user_8;user_8149.jpg;You can find me here if you need me 🦋 Spreading my wings in Bali. I’m FINALLY doing my 300hr advanced teacher training with @yoga_eastwest (i’ve put it off for sooo long, and never given myself the time!) but it feels SO good to prioritise my own knowledge and education and awareness AND I will now be able to give back threefold not only in the classes I guide, but also in my relationships, by commitments, my career and life. Two days in, and i’ve already broken down a lot of walls, broken through a lot of the emotional and mental baggage I had been carrying and am unfolding/unlearning in the right ways to re-learn and heighten my insight to a much greater level. I LOVE trainings! I just love learning!! This month is going to be filled with immeasurable transformational magic! I can feel it!! 🤗 @yoga_eastwest

user_8;user_8169.jpg;"We are creatures of love, and it’s about time we start consciously loving; ourselves, the skin we wear, others and the Earth in which we live this life.  Making simple, yet effective changes to some of our routines, and turning the mindless in to something mindFULL. • What we put on our skin, is just as important as what we put in our bodies.  Beauty and skincare products should be safe and wholesome - birthed from the Earth we live upon. • I can confidently, loudly and very very proudly say that I love using the @biossance products because I KNOW they are good for me, and I KNOW they are good for the Earth.  Sustainable. Non toxic. Vegan. Cruelty free. The cleanest skincare brand in the industry, made with love, packaged consciously and using renewable resources. THIS is what skincare should be. P.s they are now available in at Sephora in Australia! #BiossancePartner 🌱🦋✨💛🤗"
user_8;user_8170.jpg;Know that each moment is nothing more than a beautiful illusion. Our realities are experiential constructs, consisted of countless interpretations of the surrounding sensory stimuli. We exist no more than a spirit, and no less that the sea. Each second, a reflection of the ever transient nature of our limited time in this human life, and a gentle reminder to breathe with unbounded gratitude and grace. #writtenbysjana 📷: @loudawg_

user_8;user_8175.jpg;As you walk through the jungle of life, know that you are not alone. Know that at any moment, you can close your eyes, place your hand over your beating heart, and feel connected to the entire Universe. Know that the pounding in your chest, is the same rhythm that throbs within a lion, the same pulsation that pulls the ocean and the same flutter that lifts a butterfly. The heart that is nestled within you, is the same heart that is nestled within me. The heart that rests within me, is the same heart that rests within her. And the heart within her, is the same as the heart within him. We’re all hand crafted from the same star dust. All connected beyond description. All on an externalalised journey within. All desperately clinging to the fragility of our physical existence, and perhaps forgetting the beauty of our mortality. You are here, not to be remembered. But to be reminded of our immense power & pleasure. To carve open our chests, and merge the drums of life. #writtenbysjana 📷: @loudawg_

user_8;user_8177.jpg;The ocean flows within us. It moves through our veins. The same salt that floats around the ocean, floats inside our blood. We are her, and she is us. These tears I cry, are for her, by her and through her. For the pollution, the plastic and the pain she now carries because of OUR actions. OUR problems. She is bearing the scars that we should wear upon our own skin. The wounds that should float atop our own surface. She needs our help. She needs our healing. We need to kiss her the way we kiss the ones we love. Treat her with kindness, respect and love. Together, we can nurture her back to life. Together, we can make a difference. • #writtenbysjana Art & pic: @anfisa.illustrator 💛

user_8;user_8179.jpg;I’ve always found trees fascinating. The way they are equally as large, equally as intricate and equally beautiful below the surface, as they are above. The branches reaping the praise for bearing fruits, when the roots do all the hard work. What parts of you are buried? How can you give them light? What fruit are you growing? Are they healthy? Where are your roots planted? What makes you feel earthed, humbled and grounded? Is there anything else you could do today, to help you feel and recognise your inner growth? Anything you could do to help you bloom? Body Art: @anfisa.illustrator Pic: @loudawg_ #writtenbysjana

user_8;user_8181.jpg;Death of the physical form is inevitable. And the moment we come to terms with this, and learn to embrace the fragile mortality and temporary nature of these skins we wear, we can begin our journey within. A journey of unapolagetic understanding and acceptance of the Self and of Source. A profound awareness of the unity and oneness that is present within all things. We can begin to comprehend the depth of our realities, and curate a sense of perspective so honest that we can both seperate ourselves from our thoughts, forms and the senses, whilst aligning with the highest of Divinities. We were created to shed our skins. Our bodies are feeble in comparison to the energy that lains within. The moment we are born, we begin to die. The moment we attach ourselves to our physical forms, we start to DETACH from our truth. #writtenbysjana pic: @loudawg_

user_8;user_8184.jpg;"Your body is divinity incarnate. Your body is a shelter to your soul. Your body is a temporary capsule surrounding the softest of hearts, and within that heart lains an infinite capacity for love, and a light that glows exponentially. Your body is magnificent. Raw nature performing through peaks and valleys. Cascading vines, bottomless canyons, dense canopies, colour soaked landscapes, planetary pearls, and convex contours laced with silken moss and wildflowers. Your body is beautiful. Beautiful but fleeting. This body is nothing more than an instrument, aiding your consciousness to experience the human form; allowing your spirit to observe mortality. Enabling your essence to witness the Earths splendor. This body shall be returned. You will transform, transcend, and return to the land, again and again. Each new life, spading away at the layers, plowing through new veneers. Each time, on the same sub-conscious mission of self realisation and unconditional love. Each time, confronted with obstacles and difficulties, designed to teach - created with the intention of growth. This body does not define you. But this body should be treated with an understanding, a deep innate knowingness, that you are the Universe, and the Universe is you. ✨#writtenbysjana"

user_8;user_8190.jpg;Walking in my first New York Fashion Week for three of the greatest Australian designers and supporting my Aussie sisters!!

Like a smile, kindness, random compliments and warm open hearted hugs! And I can’t wait to instill these values in to my own children one day!
user_8;user_8192.jpg;Talk to the Universe and she’ll talk to you right back ✨ The past week in Koufonisia Greece, with @fykiadaretreats has been one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. I never thought I could have SO much love, for SO many people. Hearing one anothers stories, unfolding before each others eyes, silencing the static and then admiring every individual for their strength, wisdom and their courage to step in to their truth - in divine timing and perfect alignment with their path and mission. Connecting back to the self, and to Source, can be both terrifying and extraordinarily liberating. It was my HONOUR to witness and hold space for every unique soul to transform and bloom. 🦋 Thank you to everyone who embarked on this journey along side me. And a HUGE thank you to the @fykiadaretreats girls for everything you’ve done in order for it to happen. My family is now stronger by 30 people, and my heart is swollen so much that I can’t stop smiling!! Thank you. Thank you. THANK YOU!

user_8;user_8194.jpg;It is such an honour, a privilege, a blessing, to be able to host yoga retreats and hold space for so many remarkable souls from all over the world. 30 people, one shared interest in yoga, health and happiness, countless memories to be made and endless experiences to be had. Getting to know each and every person who comes to my retreats, shed their skins, lose their masks and rid themselves of the pain, the negativity, the weight they carry on their shoulders. Watching them unfold, forgive, accept and bloom is truly extraordinary. I can’t even begin to explain how lucky I feel to be able to teach yoga. Because i’m not teaching “yoga”. I’m guiding each individual toward their path, i’m aiding them in overcoming their personal mountains, and supporting them in flourishing and opening their wings. My heart is forever expanding with not only the beautiful places I get to see, but also the beautiful hearts my heart gets to hold and grow alongside. I am honoured, and overflowing with joy. Thank you. ✨💛 I hope this video brings you as much peace and calmness as there is inside my soul right now 🦋 @fykiadaretreats
