user_20;user_2034.jpg;Over the past week we’ve all seen a massive global response to the black lives matter movement and of course it is great to see how many people are standing up in solidarity and doing what they can to help. However I’ve seen some seriously disappointing responses from various world leaders (particularly in my home country and here in Australia) expressing disbelief and shock over what is going on, all the while pointing to the US as the bad guy and refusing to recognise their own countrys shortcomings. Hopefully the protests around Australia has helped highlight the issue and will have an effect. Wherever you are in the world I think it is important to recognise that racism is a global problem and to talk about it that way. Pointing to some other country and saying «but we’re not as bad as them!» does not excuse our own oppressive systems. . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #oatmeal #porridge #oats #veganoatmeal #veganporridge #veganoats #peanutbutter #peanutbutterlover #proats #highproteinvegan
user_20;user_2035.jpg;It’s great to see that the protests have had some impact in terms of justice for George Floyd. However I recognize that this movement is about so much more than getting 4 police officers convicted. So many officers responsible for black deaths across the US (and the world) still have not faced any consequences, and if we truly want justice for these victims AND some long lasting, actual systemic change we cannot lose focus now. Black lives matter, ALWAYS, not just this week. . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #smoothiebowls #smoothie #nicecream #veganicecream #smoothiebowl #smoothies #almondbutter #yummyfood

user_20;user_2037.jpg;"«If a white man wants to lynch me, that's his problem. If he's got the power to lynch me, that's my problem. Racism is not a question of attitude; it's a question of power. Racism gets its power from capitalism. Thus, if you're anti-racist, whether you know it or not, you must be anti-capitalist. The power for racism, the power for sexism, comes from capitalism, not an attitude.» Kwame Ture This quote (found via @thebeardedvegans ) explains my thoughts on this issue so much better than I could ever do in my own words. We need to see racism as the systemic problem that it is. It has everything to do with the power structures in our society today and we have to see the connections in order to dismantle it and rebuild it for the better.

user_20;user_20123.jpg;Self-isolation pasta and movie nights have definitely been one of my favourite ways to spend my evening as of late. Such a great way to connect with those you live with, or just treat yourself to a nice meal! My partner and I whipped up this puttanesca inspired pasta dish with some pantry friendly ingredients the other night and I’m so excited to share the recipe with you all in collaboration with @sanremopasta ! INGREDIENTS: -200g @sanremopasta penne -1x400g tin whole cherry tomatoes -50g olives -20g capers -3 cloves garlic -100g cannellini beans -70g kale -20ml olive oil -Salt + Pepper -Parsley (fresh or dried, for garnish) -2tbsp Pine nuts Heat your olive oil in a pan and add finely chopped garlic and cook until slightly golden. Add olives and capers and stir. Add cannellini beans and combine well. Keep cooking for a little while until everything is golden and fragrant. Rinse your tinned tomatoes, add to the pan and leave to simmer. Crush the tomatoes lightly with the back of your spoon to release more flavour. In a separate pot, cook your pasta according to package instructions. Once done, drain and add the pasta to your tomato sauce. Add the kale or any other greens of your choice and combine to wilt the kale. Gradually add around 200ml water to steam and wilt the kale. Add salt and pepper to taste at the end. Serve with dried or fresh parsley and pine nuts. #ad #sanremopasta #wearefamily

user_20;user_20138.jpg;Easter brunch inspo✨☕️ I teamed up with my favourite gal pals/amazing creators to bring you all a whole heap of pantry friendly brunch recipes for the easter weekend! Please check out @soybabie_ @melbveganguide @shaktifresh and @thekindnessechoes for the recipes for the other dishes pictured in this post💜 But first, let’s make some bomb ass HOT CROSS BUN PANCAKES🥞🥞 Ingredients: -70g whole wheat flour -15g vanilla protein powder (Can sub for 10g flour) -a pinch grated nutmeg -1/2 tsp cinnamon -1/4 tsp allspice -1/4tsp ginger -a pinch of salt -1/4tsp baking soda -1tsp flax eggs -1tsp baking powder -170g mylk -10g lemon juice First, combine your plant milk and lemon juice and set aside. Then, add all other ingredients to a bowl and whisk well to combine. Add your curdled milk to the dry mix and stir gently until the flour is incorporated (a few lumps are okay). Spoon 1-2tbsp of the mix into a non stick pan per pancake and flip when bubbles form and the edges turn golden. (Feel free to cook in some butter or oil if you want). Top with some berries, almond butter and maple syrup and you’ve got yourself an EPIC easter brekkie🥞✨🙏 . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #veganrecipes #recipeshare #eastertreats #breakfastrecipes #recipe #recipes #veganeaster #pancakes #veganpancakes #veganpancake

user_20;user_20141.jpg;While searching through the barren shelves of our local Woolies Simon and I came across these really cool looking pasta spirals from @sanremopasta and decided to try them out. In relation to this I’m therefore super happy to be teaming up with @Sanremopasta to bring you all this pantry friendly recipe that will work with pretty much ANY similar sized pasta shape you have on hand, which is perfect in these times when it can be hard to find exactly what you want in the supermarket. CREAMY MUSHROOM PASTA INGREDIENTS: -200g Pasta (use any similar sized pasta shape you want) -3 cloves Garlic -200g Mushrooms -1 tsp Dried parsley -260 ml Soy milk -90g frozen peas (can sub with any green vegetable you have on hand) -Salt + pepper to taste -400 Vegetable stock -A drizzle of olive oil how to make: Slice your mushrooms into thin slices and finely chop your garlic. Add all ingredients to a pan (except from the salt and pepper) and bring to a simmer. Boil until the pasta is cooked and enough liquid has evaporated so you have a creamy, thick sauce. Then, season with salt and pepper to taste! Serve with some nuts and seeds. (pro-tip: add the whole thing to a massive bowl and share it with your loved one while watching a movie for the ultimate self-isolation pasta night) #ad #wearefamily #sanremopasta

user_20;user_20171.jpg;#ad BANOFFEE RICE CREAM PARFAITS! 🍫🥜🍌🍯«Riskrem» translated to «Rice Cream» in english is a traditional norwegian dessert that I decided to modernize a bit for this collaboration with my faves over at @naturescharm 🤩 No regrets there, these were SO YUMMY! (Full recipe can also be found on the blog for your convenience) Porridge Ingredients: -150 g short/medium grain rice -600 ml almond milk -2 tsp sugar -1 pinch of salt -1 tsp vanilla ✨ Whipped Cream + Toppings -1 can @naturescharm whipping cream -2 tsp sugar -1 banana -a jar of @naturescharm salted caramel sauce -Chocolate -Peanut butter  Start by making your porridge. Add all ingredients to a pot and simmer while stirring occasionally until it reaches a thick porridge consistency. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool for a bit before putting it in the fridge and cooling it down completely. Whip up 1 can of refrigerated Natures Charm coconut whipping cream according to the instructions on the can with 2tsp sugar. Once porridge is cold, fold in 1 cup of coconut whipped cream into the porridge until evenly combined. Layer your rice cream with bananas, caramel sauce, shredded chocolate and any other toppings you might want in a glass and dig in!

user_20;user_20178.jpg;Yesterday’s breakfast was almond butter and salted caramel acai bowls. Salted caramel has always been my favourite acai flavour but I recently discovered that adding almond butter to it makes it even more creamy and decadent! So if you’re stuck inside with a lot of smoothie ingredients (for some reason) I highly recommend trying it out 😅 . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #acai #acaibowl #acaibowls #smoothiebowls #smoothie #nicecream #almondbutter #proteinsmoothie #proteinshake #highproteinvegan

user_20;user_20183.jpg;#ad BLACKBERRY CARDAMOM SCONES🤩🤩 I’m so happy to be bringing you all another recipe in collaboration with @naturescharm , and it just might be my favourite one yet! The full recipe is also on my blog in case you find it easier to read recipes on there☺️ Ingredients: -350g all purpose flour -100g vegan butter -2tbsp flax meal + 6 tbsp water -2 tsp baking powder -80g sugar -2 tsp cardamom -½ tsp salt -190g @naturescharm evaporated coconut milk -130g blackberries -2 tbsp @naturescharm condensed coconut milk. 🍫🍫🍫🍫 Chocolate cream: -80g dark choc -150g @naturescharm coconut whipping cream -1tsp maple syrup. Instructions: Mix flaxseeds with water and set aside. Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and cardamom in a bowl. Add in chunks of cold vegan butter and use your fingers to pinch the lumps of butter until there are no chunks larger than the size of a pea, making sure not to melt them. Stir in the blackberries. Combine your evaporated coconut milk with the flax egg, whisk to combine and pour into your bowl. Mix until roughly incorporated before turning the dough onto a clean surface and kneading until just combined but still flaky and “rough” looking. Pat into a circular disc and cut into 8 equal “slices”. Place on a tray lined with parchment paper. Brush with slightly heated sweetened condensed coconut milk. Melt the dark chocolate in a bowl over a pot of boiling water. Once melted, stream in the coconut cream and maple syrup while whisking. Leave in the fridge to cool until thickened. Stir/whisk once more before serving to loosen it slightly.  Once cooled, serve your scone by slicing it in half, adding some chocolate cream and warm berries or jam. . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #scones #veganscones #baking #recipes #veganrecipes #veganrecipeshare #recipeshare #comfortfood #desserts #chocolate
user_20;user_20184.jpg;Every morning I keep waking up as if everything’s normal and then it takes me about 10 seconds to remember what the world has come to and it’s just the strangest feeling.

user_20;user_20185.jpg;These days sure call for comfort food. I’ve been quiet about the whole situation on here as I’m wary of spreading misinformation due to the fact that - as I’m sure we’re all aware - I’m not an expert on global pandemics. But I do hope you’re all taking the situation seriously and doing your best to source reliable advice and information, wherever you are and whatever your situation is🌸🌸 My heart truly goes out to anyone who’s socially, economically or physically vulnerable during this time, I wish there was more I could do. . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #whatveganseat #food #plantbased #vegetarian #veganbreakfast #vegansofmelbourne #vegansofaustralia #melbournevegan #thrivemags #veganstudent #veganmealideas #melbournefoodblogger #melbournefoodie #melbournefood #oatmeal #porridge #oats #veganoatmeal #comfortfood #almondbutter #highproteinvegan
