I met my boyfriend Mo 🥰 8 years ago (we’re doing #longdistance, which is why you only see him every now and then).⁣ ⁣⁣ High school was the most difficult time in my life.

I wanted to understand myself and help others as a psychiatrist. I also worked through all of the above in therapy 👆🏼 finally.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I started #Veggiekins in therapy. It was a food compliance tool, to show I was following my meal plan and taking care of myself. I recovered from Anorexia and got sober from all substances + alcohol before graduating early. I also went #vegan, which taught me compassion for animals, the environment and most importantly, myself 😌⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I used the extra time after grad to travel for 9 months (can you tell I’m a Sagittarius lol) before starting my first job at a consulting firm but after 3 months, old habits resurfaced so I left my job to go back to treatment.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ And now we’re here!

user_3;user_340.jpg;My college campus doctor told me something would change my life. She said: choose to medicate your symptoms forever, or choose yourself and treat the problem.⁣ ⁣ After 13 years with an eating disorder, I developed amenorrhea and with that, ALL things hormonal imbalance like constantly feeling cold, breakouts, physical pain, metabolism and sleep irregularity. She started me on synthetic hormonal birth control and when that didn’t work, we resorted to progesterone pills every 3 months to force bleed.⁣ ⁣ Only after I became tired of the unpredictable side effects of the numerous pills I cycled through did I decide to heal my relationship with my body the natural way. I listened, I rested, I gave back to it, for once. My new prescription: patience and an open mind. Oh, and an intricate chart print out that I had to use to track details of my cycles.⁣ ⁣ Much of my healing journey has been the journey to balance and making my body feel safe again. The beautiful thing is that our body is a system of cycles, and often balance comes with tuning into them and working with, not against them. @naturalcycles is like the modern day app version of the print out chart my doctor gave me--it makes taking control of your reproductive health easy and is the only digital FDA cleared, natural alternative to hormonal birth control.⁣ ⁣ Natural Cycles uses a combination of your basal body temperature and algorithm to help you familiarize yourself with your cycle, and all I can say is, if you’re feeling disconnected from your body, this is an easy way to start tuning in. ⁣ ⁣ P.S. If you’re interested in trying it, they gave me a discount code (REMY) to share with you so you can get 20% off an annual subscription + free thermometer. Please note that Natural Cycles does not protect against STIs and you must be over the age of 18 to use.⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #naturalcycles #ad

user_3;user_349.jpg;Here’s a sneaky way to get more out of your avocado toast 🥑✨⁣ ⁣ Add beans! It sounds funky, but it’s a trick I use to make avo toast a little more nutritious, add fiber + protein. It’s also great if you’re not a bean lover (or you have kids who aren’t 😉).⁣ ⁣ You can’t taste them, and they add a nice creaminess—almost a guacamole texture. To finish I like microgreens or sprouts for extra green power, and seasoning is up to you.⁣ ⁣ I shared the loose recipe in one of my latest YouTube videos, link in my bio!⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #vegan #glutenfree

Are you fixated on exercise and weight?⁣ ⁣ If so, gentle reminder that no exercise will ever be healthier than having a healthy relationship with yourself.⁣ ⁣ My body has changed since this photo in November—actually it changed a LOT after the motorcycle accident and it has changed even more since then.

user_3;user_3111.jpg;Feeling loss, feeling lost. Anyone else? 🙃⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I find myself fluctuating between feeling frustration over things that have been lost & confusion about what the best thing to do is amidst this virus situation.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I am not rushing to find an answer, because I’m not sure there is one.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ My youngest sister has been doing virtual school since the beginning of the year, and my family has been stuck in Thailand after leaving China in January. My cat is alone in China.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ @mfrao and I will no longer see each other and as entrepreneurs, both of our businesses are taking a hit. My retreat in Tulum is obviously no longer. Most businesses in general will be experiencing the same thing right now.⁣⁣ My grandpa contracted pneumonia last week, and we aren’t allowed to visit him in his building. We might carry something into his home if we did anyways. ⁣⁣ But instead of focusing on loss, remembering what I have offers the perspective I need.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I am healthy and well. My family has a place to stay, they are safe and healthy. We have someone in Shanghai who is able to pop in to care for our cat. Mo and I don’t work traditional jobs, and we are used to some uncertainty + income fluctuation. Chloe has family to stay with (me), whereas her fellow international students cannot go back to their home country, and have nowhere to go within the US once school closes its doors.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ We will lose, but we have so much to be grateful for. May we remember that we are A L L going to be affected as a collective and as such, need to support each other and our communities, not behave poorly out of fear.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ B E W E L L & B E K I N D 🙏🏼

user_3;user_3113.jpg;Not here to tell you what self care should look like, just here to remind you to take care of yourself, whatever that means to you 😌⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ For some humans that means eating more veggies, and for others it’s learning to stop fearing pizza. It could be a walk every evening, or maybe it’s taking a break from a daily workout routine.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Self care isn’t one size fits all, and being well means more than just the way your body looks or feels. It’s mind, body, spirit & more & more & more!⁣ ⁣⁣ The best part is that it doesn’t have to cost ya. High end clean skincare and exciting new snacks will never not excite me, but nothing beats a phone call with a loved one, sleeping in, listening to a podcast, dancing in my undies, a good stretch, saying no, hugging a human or turning off my phone for a few hours.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ What’s your favourite free way to practice self care? 👇🏽⁣⁣ ⁣ #user_3 📷 @nishabalsara

There is always discomfort involved.⁣ ⁣ Sometimes it takes a missed flight, delayed train or schedule mishap to bring these things to the surface—I mean, at least once every trip I’ll text my best friend and tell her I just “feel weird” being away.⁣ ⁣ The discomfort is always with us, sometimes it just takes removing the “stuff” in our lives to get to the work.

user_3;user_3129.jpg;Welp, I’m not sure why my first #NEDAweek post was removed but I just wanted to leave this here!⁣ ⁣ A few years ago I was finally able to cultivate a healthy relationship with my body & food after 15 years with an eating disorder.⁣ ⁣ Whether or not you’ve experienced an eating disorder, I think diet culture and the emphasis on thinness + food being tied to guilt is pervasive. ⁣ ⁣ So this is a reminder to nourish, not punish your body, a reminder I needed myself throughout my healing and still need from time to time 😌⁣ ⁣ Also, a continued commitment to you that I will never refer to food on my platforms as “clean” (or dirty 🤨) “guilt free” (???) “skinny” (like have u seen those recipes out there for a skinny sandwich lol, so what is the alternative, a fat sandwich???) or terms of that nature.⁣ ⁣ I don’t emphasize calories because food is more than numbers, I focus on nutrition—how nourishing, how comforting, how delicious, how many colours of plants on the plate.⁣ ⁣ Be well & be kind (and that includes being kind to yourself 💘)⁣ ⁣ #user_3

user_3;user_3137.jpg;Choosing yourself is a practice.  It is not something intuitive for me—it’s work, but it’s work worth doing and it gets easier.  Give yourself permission to honour the light that is within you. Say no even when it’s hard. Take care of yourself without feeling guilty. Let go of things that no longer serve you. Choose you.

user_3;user_3147.jpg;I probably 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 have to tell you that I’m passionate about truly clean, cruelty free & vegan beauty 😉 A few years ago, my diet and lifestyle shifted towards natural and non-toxic, so it only made sense that my beauty products did too—𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘦 𝘱𝘶𝘵 𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘣𝘰𝘥𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘳𝘣𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘴𝘬𝘪𝘯.⁣ ⁣ And while clean beauty wasn’t always the bees knees back then, I’d say it’s pretty freakin’ cool nowadays! So much so that @100percentpure makeup was used at the @lelarose #NYFW show and I love to see clean beauty go mainstream.⁣ ⁣ I don’t post makeup selfies often but this is the easy makeup lewk I wore to the show.

user_3;user_3160.jpg;Wellness journeys often stem from a state of being unwell. Sound familiar? 🙋🏻‍♀️⁣ ⁣ I can tell you that is certainly true of my journey—if you’re new here, before my vegan/wellness journey vegan, I struggled with addiction to substances + alcohol and an eating disorder. All of these things have changed my relationship with doctors.⁣ ⁣ I saw them a lot. Post ED recovery, working on amenorrhea, hormonal imbalances and autoimmune flares, but I didn’t want fixes for my symptoms, I wanted healing (and inclusive healing! no—I wasn’t planning to stop being vegan).⁣ ⁣ Living an “alternative” lifestyle, with a mum that taught me the value in holistic healing + my commitment to veganism, I used to find doctors visits to be a mostly unenjoyable experience. I’ve been a @parsleyhealth member for a while and all I can say is, it’s a completely new experience working with doctors with a mutual appreciation for a holistic approach.⁣ ⁣ I love that I didn’t have to ask my doctor not to disclose my weight during my first check-up. I was asked whether I wanted to know, given my ED history. I’m not questioned about my choice to eat vegan, I’m supported by doctors who actually know what that means.⁣ ⁣ Currently feeling very grateful, supported and excited about healing. That is all 😌

But even if you’re not flying/injured/perpetually cold, IR sauna is great post workout for optimizing recovery too.⁣ ⁣ Infrared saunas emit a light wavelength that causes your body temp to rise. It’s sweaty spaghetti, but nothing like stepping into a steam sauna (like, you can sit comfortably for half an hour). You can find one near you on @mindbody--some NYC faves are @higherdose + @clean.market .⁣ ⁣ P.S. To get the most out of your IR sauna experience • drink lots of H2O • dry brush your body beforehand to encourage cell regeneration + circulation • consider chlorella (remember that superfood mint choc chia pudding I shared?). Also, take off alllll your jewelry and leave the phone outside. Do as I say not as I do because this was an after shot just for you, ‘gram fam. ⁣ ⁣ Have you tried infrared sauna before? I have a few friends that love it so much they have their own saunas at home 😗⁣ ⁣ #user_3 x #mindbody #mindbodypartner
user_3;user_3182.jpg;If you give a mouse a cookie... oh wait, these mice are cookies 🐭🍪⁣ ⁣ These cookie critters are a remake of my hedgehog cookies!

user_3;user_3183.jpg;Between #Veganuary and ⁣ #DryJanuary, I’m really feeling this month 😏✨⁣ ⁣ I mean, this is the month where being a #sober #vegan bean is the least weird.⁣ ⁣ But really, I’m here to support you if you’re making a lifestyle change this month, or trying something new.⁣ ⁣ You can find all my recipes on the blog + the sobriety series from last year!⁣ ⁣ Are you trying either? 👇🏽⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #vegan #sober⁣
user_3;user_3184.jpg;Veganuary Tip 🍜🇯🇵 Recreate your fave cultural dishes—like vegan + gluten free zaru soba!⁣ ⁣ It’s a classic Japanese dish I grew up with, cold buckwheat noodles + dipping sauce but did you know that traditionally it’s 𝐧𝐨𝐭 vegan or gluten free?⁣ ⁣ Most buckwheat soba is made with a small amount of wheat flour (even tho buckwheat itself IS gluten free) and the dipping sauce is made with soy sauce and fish stock, but I got you with this recipe!!!⁣ ⁣ P.S. My mum always used to twirl them into these noodle nests (idk what to call them!) to keep them from turning into one big noodle mess.⁣ ⁣ Recipe link in bio or head to → https://user_3blog.com/2020/01/13/vegan-zaru-soba/⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #vegan #glutenfree #zarusoba ⁣
user_3;user_3185.jpg;What’s in my shower 👇🏽🌿✨⁣⁣ ⁣ Everything is always #vegan, #crueltyfree & #nontoxic but I recently re-stocked faves from @thedetoxmarket and thought my shower shelf was looking exxxtra fresh so perfect time to share.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I follow the same guidelines when purchasing body products that I do with skincare and makeup. Most of us put much less emphasis on body products, when the scalp is one of the most absorbent parts of the body and... most of our skin is the skin on our bod!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Some of these products can be a little higher in price (#smallbiz brands going against the grain and sourcing responsibly) but bottom line—less ingredients, ingredients you recognize and even basics like straight up coconut oil are incredible swaps. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I’m sharing in more detail on my stories & also wanted to shout out @acurebeauty, another great affordable clean brand (I just ran out so it’s missing from the shot).⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ #user_3 #vegan
user_3;user_3186.jpg;Matcha cashew butter toast ✨🌿 would you try it?⁣ ⁣ I had to recreate this toast I had while in Amsterdam and it’s insanely easy to make.

user_3;user_3187.jpg;Veganuary Tip 🌿 Anyone doing #veganuary this year should supplement B-12 & here’s a giveaway! 👇🏽 ⁣ B-12 is an essential vitamin for major bodily processes and supports things like our blood cells, metabolism and nervous system. It can be derived from bacteria found in soil, but as soil quality has degraded over time, it is more difficult now for herbivores. It is possible through food, but safest to supplement for your health, my friends! ⁣ ⁣ I’m excited to bring you this giveaway in partnership with @globalhealingcenter to give one winner the same vegan B-12 I’ve been using for years (their vitamins + supplements are all-natural, vegan and GMO-free).⁣ ⁣ To enter:⁣ ① Like this photo⁣ ② Follow @globalhealingcenter & @user_3 ③ Tag a veggie friend in the comments below!⁣ Winner will be DM’ed in 1 week, tagging yourself, businesses or Kylie Jenner do not count as entries.⁣ Open worldwide! 🌎 ⁣ P.S. Did you know that it’s not only herbivores that may need a B-12 boost? Yup--that’s a myth! Meat eaters can also be at risk of deficiency.⁣ ⁣ #user_3 x #globalhealingcenter #giveaway⁣
user_3;user_3188.jpg;First recipe of 2020 had to be cookies ofc 🍪 but not just any cookie—Flourless “Nutella” Chocolate Hazelnut Cookies. ⁣ Crunchy hazelnuts plus vegan chocolate makes the richest, melt in your mouth ferrero rocher vibe... except it’s healthy and made with no refined sugars, or added oils! ⁣ Recipe link in bio or head to → https://user_3blog.com/2020/01/09/flourless-choc-hazelnut-cookies/⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #vegan #glutenfree #paleo #refinedsugarfree #oilfree #nutella
user_3;user_3189.jpg;S U R P R I S E ! (swipe 👉🏼)⁣ ⁣ After years of long distance, I finally managed to surprise Mo in Amsterdam. Swipe to see the video! Since we don’t live in the same country, it’s no exaggeration when I say every moment we have together is special (no really, like going to get groceries).⁣ ⁣ I only spent 4ish days in #Amsterdam but thanks to @united’s direct flight from Newark and exclusive access to the @timeshifter app for MileagePlus members, I received a personalized jet lag plan and was able to get the most out of every single day. Usually, I allocate a day or two to be sluggish and adjust to a new time zone, but if you’re anything like me and like to be out and about on day one, this is a game changer.⁣ ⁣ United MileagePlus members get a free trial with the app and other perks like miles that never expire and the option to donate to charities using miles. You can also carbon offset your flights directly through United!⁣ ⁣ Thank you United for making #MyUnitedJourney and this surprise a success.⁣ ⁣ #ad #user_3
user_3;user_3190.jpg;A fancy lil’ vegan waffle I had on my last day in Shanghai.⁣ I mean...look at the design, and that superfood colour!!! ✨ ⁣ I love visiting each year and trying the new vegan options and this year did not disappoint between @house_press new flagship (a glitzy modern interior + traditional Chinese medicine inspired menu) & vegan sushi that fooled my omnivore family. ⁣ I updated my vegan Shanghai guide #linkinbio with new spots 🇨🇳 and it makes me SO happy to hear it has been helpful for those visiting! ⁣ #user_3 #shanghai #vegan
user_3;user_3191.jpg;Just wrapped flight number 8 as of late, so let’s talk about carbon emissions & responsible travel ✈️⁣ ⁣ There’s no getting around the fact that flying = inevitable CO2 emissions, so I carbon offset every single flight.⁣ This is something I actually learned in high school in Shanghai and you can do this directly through most major airlines (I use @united ecoskies program) or climatecare.org to calculate + donate appropriately.⁣ ⁣ This is one of those “do your best” scenarios because flying is usually unavoidable, but aside from flying it’s important to look at your everyday emissions too. I don’t drive a car, I’m a New York Subway public transportation girl & I’m vegan. All these things are relevant because they make my #carbonfootprint significantly smaller.⁣ ⁣ Of course, what you do and use when you travel matters too but that’s another story. I’ve got plenty of YouTube videos and posts sharing what I pack/sustainable products I use.⁣ ⁣ You SHOULD travel and see the beauty that is mama earth 🌎 but you SHOULD also do so responsibly and mindfully.  #user_3 #responsibletravel
user_3;user_3192.jpg;My heart hurts 🔥 Between #australiafires coverage and reckless action taken back home, I feel SICK watching the news. I’ve gone back and forth about how I can contribute because⁣ ⁣ • 14.4 million acres of land has been lost⁣ • Half a billion animals have been burnt alive and 8,000 koalas have died so far⁣ • Fires the size of Manhattan are burning⁣ • 1,500 homes have been lost, including the home of my childhood⁣ friend • The air quality will have an effect on the health of the Australian people and trickle down effects including melting glaciers in New Zealand⁣ ⁣ Maybe you’ve felt helpless, as I have, so we’re going to do the what we did with the Amazonian fires as it’s the best I can think to do (swipe to see infographic explaining just how big these fires are compared to those).⁣ ⁣ The other day @mchx88 sent me a DM & pointed out that of all 113K human beans here donated as much as $10, it would be over a million dollars raised. I will donate on behalf of “🙏🏼” comments as not everyone who wishes to donate is in a position to but please know that the cost of a single cup of coffee ☕️ is a meaningful contribution as is $5, $10, sharing posts for awareness or simply your healing energy sent down under.⁣ ⁣ See my stories for more & send support to @WIRESWILDLIFERESCUE / @CFAVIC / @NSWRFS / @REDCROSSAU⁣ ⁣ You don’t have to love the animals, or live in Australia to care. We all share the same home. 🙏🏼🌎
user_3;user_3193.jpg;In case you’re wondering what the heck #veganuary is...⁣ 〰️⁣ It’s a month long pledge or challenge (in January) to try out a vegan/plant based diet.⁣ 〰️⁣ My dad actually participated a few years ago (you can find an old old YouTube video too) and as a result, his blood pressure problems improved so much he was able to stop taking medication.⁣ 〰️⁣ I’d describe him now as a flexitarian—largely vegan when possible, but the *one month* was enough time for him to see, feel, experience the impact.⁣ 〰️⁣ Whether it’s about YOU, the 🌎 or the 🐰🐮🐷🐶, veganuary is a rad time to try eating more plants & less meat. The best part is that there are so many resources available, via @weareveganuary and of course all the other vegan people + publications are here to support it.⁣ 〰️⁣ This month I’ll be sprinkling in veganuary tips & tricks all month long and if you’re doing the damn thing I’m sending you a big virtual hug!!!⁣ ⁣ #user_3 #vegan #bali⁣

user_3;user_3195.jpg;New year, new decade, new energy ⚡️✨ ⁣ ⁣ I don’t believe that growth waits for any given momentous day or time—we are growing every moment, shaped by all that we consume and all that surrounds us—but there’s something about the start of a year that feels so free and fluid.⁣ It’s trust that everything that happens this year/this decade, even things that don’t go according to plan, are part of the plan.⁣ ⁣ P.S. I swear these pink moments find me everywhere I go 😉

user_3;user_3197.jpg;I went through old photos to make a decade highlights post but found this instead 👉🏽⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ Not gonna lie—I felt a deep sadness that I have very few pictures of myself sober, doing normal teenager things (these are a handful that I feel least embarrassed by) but these photos also show me how much I’ve grown. This started before 2010 and I’m 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐥 growing.⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ It was during this decade that I fell off the deep end with anorexia, alcohol, drugs, depression, self harm & nearly dropping out of school (that post was sadly not a joke). ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ It was during this decade that I became ED recovered, restored my period, got sober (5 years!), became vegan & self employed doing what fulfills me.⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣ Last pic is me during college when I started treatment for my ED. That photo makes me very happy 🙂⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ Without lows there are no highs.⁣⁣ Keep going & keep growing ✨🌿⁣⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ #user_3
user_3;user_3198.jpg;Be honest—have you ever thought that nontoxic/clean beauty = not effective?⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ I know I did and years ago that might’ve been true, but I mean look at these nails!!! I’ve gotta hand it to 2019 👋🏽 clean beauty has only gotten better and better ✨⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Once I decided that living nontoxic was important to me, everything from my haircare, toothpaste, bathroom cleaner, skincare, makeup, shampoo, body lotion etc. has gotten a makeover.⁣⁣ Actually, a lot of that has been going back to basics, like plant oils instead of body lotion and homemade ACV concoctions instead of cleaners. ⁣⁣ I’m passionate about this from my head to my toes (or fingertips) because our bodies really do absorb 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 we put on it. And it’s not just about us—what we use has an impact on the earth, animals & also those administering services for us (think about your nail tech or hair stylist)!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Have questions about clean beauty or nontoxic products? Leave them below 👇🏽 ⁣or search “clean beauty” on my site, there are 3-4 diff posts! #linkinbio⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ #user_3⁣⁣
