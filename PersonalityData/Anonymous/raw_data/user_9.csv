user_9;user_935.jpg;☀️Filming a Q&A so drop your Q here👇🏼 On the topic of youtube.. I’ve had a very long break from being consistent with it. Partly because it just became repetitive showing what I eat since I eat the same thing basically daily😂 With the lack of training that meant no workout videos, and then with my skin breaking out last year it became a constant “why does your skin look like that and you look different to years ago” no shit really? I went from being a teenager looking like a 13 year old to turning into an adult🤯🤣 Got a bit over hearing peoples unsolicited advice and comments. 👉🏼 I would love to know what videos are your favourite and why.. mainly the why? Do you enjoy seeing what I eat and for what reason? I love creating videos, and making food look fun and artsy and showing how simple and easy vegan food can be but of course want it to inspire you guys in the right way! (ps workout videos will be back I am now training again). Anddddd this is a whole topic in itself but I will be holding off from doing sponsored videos on my channel for the time being because it annoys people too much. I’ll address this in the Q&A but briefly, I always work with brands I personally love, use and find value in. If I was promoting detox teas and waist trainers etc then I would understand the complaints, the amount of emails I get for things like that which offer $$$.. I decline them all because they don’t provide value or healthfulness! As a viewer you are not obligated to buy from what I promote and for example a video that is sponsored is still providing other content within it. I guess just know it’s always genuine from me and it supports me creating online. In future if I do a spon video I will fill in the gaps between videos to not overdo it👍🏻 Thanks for reading the essay😆

user_9;user_943.jpg;Beautiful Australia😔🙏🏼 It’s hard to digest the devastation and horrors occurring across the country with the bushfires.

user_9;user_945.jpg;Plant-powered🍃🌈 When I first went vegan over 5 years ago, I signed up to a challenge online which helped motivate me to give it a go. It was the resource that pushed me through that month and I never looked back. Going vegan has not only opened my life to a whole new world of compassion and understanding but also cured the constipation (lol💩), bloating, PMS(no more excruciating cramps and vomiting on my period) and fatigue! It was incredible to finally feel healthy and vibrant.  The vegan bundle is for anyone and everyone, you don’t have to be vegan! Whether you are looking to introduce more plants into your diet, trying to go vegan or are vegan. We decided to team up and put together the bundle to make it easy and affordable for you, with everything you need at your fingertips, and these ebooks are yours for a lifetime. If I had this type of resource back when I first went vegan I would be doing backflips.  The Vegan Bundle is over in less than 20 hours. Don’t miss it as you’ll no longer be able to get this opportunity. 60 ebooks for only $50 USD bit.ly/tessbundle  The bundle is perfect and has everything you need to get healthier and feel your best: 👉🏼 1000s of plant based recipes (lots of easy, simple recipes including dietary requirements eg. gluten free, soy free etc) 👉🏼 Meal plans and budget meals 👉🏼 Mindful eating guides 👉🏼 Hormonal and period health 👉🏼 Gut health 👉🏼 Plant based nutrition 👉🏼 Fitness guides and workout plans 👉🏼 Cruelty-free natural beauty and lifestyle info  My biggest tip: Nutrition is key and that’s why a whole-food plant based diet should be the focus, eating a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes etc. A mistake that people make is switching diets and not planning it well, then unfortunately feeling flat as a result. To avoid this, learn about plant-based nutrition so you are aware of the foods you are choosing and planning your meals appropriately (including enough calories). With so many recipes and nutrition information in the bundle you’ll be set for the year🙌🏼 Ps any sale through my link bit.ly/tessbundle goes into the draw to win a NUTRIBULLET BLENDER🎉 Link in bio

user_9;user_956.jpg;The beach never disappoints🌈 and neither does a workout.. trained 3 times over the last few days after almost 3 months off! That’s the longest I have been sedentary in 5 years😅 I’m sick of being a couch potato and also started to notice my body changing.. It’s not a big deal at all as I know I can get fit again in time, will actually be more interesting to see how specific training changes my physique! Getting started though.. boy is it difficult at first. Mentally I’m ready and prepared but physically I have become weak😦😂 So if you are struggling with getting started, just push through, give it a go and take it super easy, work your way up👌🏼 Excited to have started again and can focus on my health, because daily movement is important and it’s much more than just looking good🦋

user_9;user_967.jpg;"Happy World Vegan Day🌱 Firstly, EXCITING NEWS! My new eBook ‘Oh Sweet Vegan’ is releasing on NOVEMBER 7th.. only 7 days to go🙌🏼 I’m beyond excited and will share more info over the next few days. Turn post notifications on so you don’t miss anything.  Today is my veganniversary and marks 5 years being vegan🥳 Who else went vegan on November 1st? Going vegan is one of the best decisions I have made. I’ve aligned with my core values of compassion towards all animals and I felt healthier ever since changing my diet years ago. I couldn’t imagine it any other way🙏🏼 If you are interested in veganism and don’t know where to start; sign up to challenge22.com for a 22 day challenge and watch these documentaries: Dominion, Game Changers, Cowspiracy, What The Health and check out the book ‘How Not To Die’ by Dr Greger!"
user_9;user_968.jpg;💪🏼🌱 This is me back in August after 3 weeks of consistent training and eating mindfully. Prior to this I had barely exercised consistently for months and didn’t focus on nutrition as much. I get a lot of questions about fitness, one common question is do I find it hard getting back into training after a break? For the first week I do when mentally forming that routine again but once my body remembers the feeling of exercising, I love it and get a buzz of motivation! Exercise has such a positive impact in how I feel - I feel happy, have more energy and clarity/clearer thinking! Physically I feel a bit weak at first, so I take it easy, however I do have good muscle memory so I gain back my strength fast. Do I have any physical changes when not exercising? I do, especially when I am very sedentary like at the moment but it’s not a dramatic change and most areas I remain quite the same. I soften out in a few areas like my lower stomach and have lost some muscle mass in my glutes and upper body. It doesn’t bother me because I know that when I do start training again I’ll have something to focus on and also it doesn’t take too long, like you can see in this photo, only a few weeks to get back some definition. I’ll have to take some before photos before I start training again over the coming weeks, it’ll be interesting to see. Overall though, the positive effects on my mental health and physical ability (functionality) from exercising outweighs aesthetics👌🏼 If you have anymore fitness questions drop them below👇🏼

user_9;user_977.jpg;Young Mickey with two eyes 😍🥰🥺 The second photo, such a lil baby. Mickey was actually found wondering the streets as a pup and my nanna took her in to look after her - meant to be❤️ That last photo makes me laugh so much. My nanna and I not ready for the photo and Mickey is like 😳😂 RIP❤️
user_9;user_978.jpg;Rest peacefully now my precious Mickey❤️ You were strong throughout your 16 years here and brought so much joy into my life.  I feel empty and my heart tore into a million pieces as I held you during your final moments watching you fade away. But I know you are no longer in pain anymore. Forever in my heart❤️ love you. ⠀ Mickey was special and soldiered on through the tough times. She lost her first eye in 2013 as another dog scratched it and her second eye in early 2017 as the eye went blind. That never stopped her from living her best life though! Unfortunately with age she had a tumour growth over the last year which got too big and last night, an infection😔  If only dogs lived forever.

user_9;user_986.jpg;"Motivation for exercising & how to find it?🙋🏼‍♀️ It happens to us all, the days (or weeks/months) where you have barely any motivation to exercise. As I’ve recently got back on track with exercising I thought I’d share some tips! ⚡️Figure out your why! Write down a list of reasons you like to exercise! For myself it’s the mental clarity and post-exercise endorphins; exercising makes me happy! I also feel stronger, sharper, function better (improved posture etc). Exercising is so important for our health especially when we live in such a sedentary world! ⚡️Goals! Create a list of goals you want to achieve. Start small & have a goal to keep consistent/stick to your routine. Or it could be to get stronger, faster, learn a new exercise, perfect your form, push ups/pull ups etc! Once you start to accomplish them that’ll make you feel great and more motivated. ⚡️Habits + Prioritising! It’s easy to say “I’ll do it tomorrow” and then that becomes a habit. If you want to get moving, prioritise it! Train earlier in the day or whenever you have the most energy. ⚡️Make it interesting! Spice up your routine with new exercises, try group fitness classes or just get active exploring nature with a walk or run. If it’s interesting you’ll likely stick to it! Write out your weekly workout schedule so that you are prepared and know what to do before you begin. ⚡️Nutrition! Ensure you are eating nutritious meals and keeping hydrated. You don’t want to start your workout only to feel flat and tired 10 mins in! Healthy snacks come in handy too like bliss balls or fruit🍌  You’ll have days where it won’t go to plan and that’s okay, just keep pushing through and before you know it you’ll have a new routine! Hope that’s helpful! If you have any other tips comment them below😊"

user_9;user_988.jpg;COCONUT JACKFRUIT CURRY🥥🌱 Save this post for the recipe! I served it with homemade fluffy naan bread, jasmine rice, coriander and coconut yoghurt!  Curry Recipe: 1 pack of @amazoniaco curry tender jack 3/4 cup canned coconut milk 1 red capsicum, diced 1 cup spinach, diced Salt and pepper to taste 1. Add the jackfruit to a nonstick pan on high heat, cook until it begins to golden. Add in the coconut milk, capsicum, spinach and salt/pepper and combine. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 8 minutes. (If using plain canned jackfruit, drain/rinse well and add 1-2 tsp curry powder to this recipe) The @amazoniaco Tender Jack is an amazing plant-based meat alternative, organically grown, sustainably sourced and no added nasties inside  Naan recipe: 1 packet of active yeast 1/2 cup warm water 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp coconut sugar 1 3/4 cup spelt flour 2 tbsp @purecocobella coconut yoghurt 1. Add the yeast, water and sugar to a bowl and whisk. Set aside for 10 mins until frothy. Stir in the coconut yoghurt. 2. Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and pour in the wet mixture, combine until a large ball forms. Flour a bench and knead for 1 min. Place the dough ball in a clean bowl and cover with a tea towel and set in a warm place for 1 hour. 3. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch to remove air and knead on a floured surface for 1 min, add extra flour if needed. Separate into smaller pieces and roll each piece into a teardrop shape. 4. Heat a pan on medium/high (best cooked with a light oil spray) and add a piece of the dough, cook the first side until bubbles appear, flip and cook for another 2 mins and repeat with remaining dough.  I get my staple ingredients like flour, rice, seasonings, sugar etc from my favourite bulk food store @thesourcezetland👌🏼

user_9;user_9120.jpg;Feeling strong & healthy💪🏼 Training lately has been so much fun, I’m mixing things up by adding in more plyometrics to my circuits. Getting sweaty jumping around💦 I just love the post-workout buzz after✨ ⠀ My workouts kinda change with the seasons, as summer approaches I feel more inclined to move my body & do cardio/conditioning training. I definitely want to focus on body weight strength too (pull ups/push ups). The great thing about fitness for me is listening to my body/mind & doing what makes me feel happy, strong & alive in the moment - definitely a reason why I feel motivated & don’t get bored training.. because it’s never forced + I enjoy it😁 So tell me below, what’s your motivation & reason for training? ⠀ I’ve just uploaded a NEW 10 MIN AT HOME HIIT WORKOUT on my YouTube! It’s equipment free & in real time so you can workout with me plus I added in beginner options. Really hope you enjoy this video, let me know what you think & if you want to see more❤️ #vegan

I’m still not happy with the shot😂🤦🏼‍♀️ But at least I know this recipe is perfecto and I got to eat endless brownies. As you may know I’m trying to make as many recipes as possible allergen friendly so everyone can enjoy🤗 it’s been challenging but that’s what I like about this ebook.

user_9;user_9126.jpg;🌺 Back on my homemade smoothie bowl grind👅👅 After getting back from Bali last week, I was still in holiday mode and ate so lazily (I’m talking packets of chips and lollies/ice cream and takeout food) and haven’t been exercising. It’s not a big deal because I know it‘s only temporary (I must say though that being lazy with food in Bali is so much easier since it’s all cheap and healthy😂) But I thought I’d chat about motivation, as a common question I get asked is “How are you always so motivated to eat healthy and exercise”. My motivation to live a healthy lifestyle is that it makes me feel amazing from the inside out. That’s enough for me to be consistent! I love feeling energised, refreshed, having good digestion, clearer skin and mental clarity that comes from a healthy diet and moving my body! But of course there’s times in life where you fall off routine due to travelling, busyness or stress and that’s okay because for the most part it’s only temporary. I don’t overthink it or feel bad, instead I plan what to do to get back into my routine when ready. In this case it was just grocery shopping, a bit of meal and produce prep and planning out my workout routine for the following week.. and today I get back into it! I’ll also add that when in a consistent routine, yes I do eat sweets or processed foods sometimes as I listen to my body but honestly when eating whole foods my body rarely craves for it. It’s just mainly me taste testing things for my ebook. ★ My big tip for when you have fallen out of routine and don’t feel your current best self - don’t spend your time feeling upset or guilty, instead use that time to make action and put together a plan, even if it’s just small steps or changes! Be proactive and positive😊 ✨ Now for the recipe: Bananas, blackberries, mango, @amazonpower pure acai, blended with @purecocobella💦 and topped with fruits + dry goodies from @thesourcebulkfoods #vegan #motivation #health

user_9;user_9141.jpg;LETʼS GET JUICY🌈🥕🥒🍋🍉 Who else loves cold pressed juices? Juicing does get a bad rep, most commonly seen as a weight-loss fad but itʼs so much more than that when used as a health tool instead of weight-loss tool. I think juicing is perfect to incorporate into your daily lifestyle along with a balanced plant-based diet that has insoluble fibre coming from other foods. Juicing is a great way to consume an abundance of nutrient rich plants that you otherwise couldnʼt eat in 1 meal & to get in veggies that you dislike eating whole, for me thatʼs celery😝 The main benefit of juicing is that it allows your body to absorb the nutrients rapidly as your body doesnʼt need to digest the fibre. - So whatʼs the difference between blending & juicing? Juicing is the process where the liquid is extracted from the fruit or vegetable & youʼre left with a concentrated liquid that contains vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients etc. Whereas with blending youʼre putting the whole fruit or vegetable in the blender & what you put in you get out which is why smoothies are more dense & filling. Also thereʼs only so much produce you can fit into a blender. I think juices & smoothies both have a place in ones diet as do most importantly whole-foods! - What about the sugar? Juicing aside, people often worry that fruit contains too much sugar & itʼs “unhealthy” BUT the sugar in whole-foods is packaged perfectly with nutrients & fibre which regulates & slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. Processed & refined table sugar on the other hand is empty calories, contains no fibre & is not nutrient dense so donʼt confuse the two🙈 Juice does remove the insoluble fibre however soluble fibre remains! But yes juicing just fruits isnʼt ideal in excess & itʼs best to eat fruit with the insoluble fibre intact to avoid a sugar spike & if you have insulin issues. Remember that vegetables should be the star ingredients in your juices⭐️ - Here’s my go-to combo at the moment🌱 Celery, cos lettuce, spinach, beetroot, cucumber, carrot, lemon, ginger & parsley! What’s your favourite? I use the @mod_cold_press juicer

Transfer tofu to a tray and bake for 10-15 minutes at 200°c. ⋆ HEMP DRESSING RECIPE: 1/2 avocado 1/3 cup hemp seeds 2 tbsp tahini 1 lemon juice 3 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 garlic clove 1 cup fresh parsley 1/2 cup fresh coriander Salt and pepper to taste Water to blend if needed Blended ingredients in my @vitamix_aunz or use a food processor until creamy, adjust taste as needed! * The dressing is rich in healthy fats, iron, calcium, fibre, protein, vitamin E & omega 3! ⋆ Ingredients like hemp, miso, tahini, nooch, quinoa are from @thesourcebulkfoods✨ Be sure to tag me if you make it, love seeing your creations💛 #vegan #recipe #bestofvegan

user_9;user_9164.jpg;My happy place, my home town, pure bliss✨💖 There’s something about the Gold Coast like no other place for me. It’s peaceful, people are always smiling & friendly, the beautiful beaches & mountains, time feels so slow, winter doesn’t really exist😂 but most importantly has a place in my heart as I grew up there & my parents are still living there who I miss a lot. Can’t wait to move back in the coming years but I sure as hell need to visit more often until then😌 I have a lil dilemma that has held me back from moving, I guess I’ve figured the solution but it does still make me a lil upset to think about it all. Long story short. I moved to Sydney 7 years ago & lived with my grandparents as I wanted to change my lifestyle as I was moving back & forward between my parents often. I lived with my grandparents up until 18 & since moving out have visited basically every week! There’s also Mickey (their dog) who is my baby💕🐶 she’s 13 yrs old & blind (has no eyes) but is so amazing, happy & smart! So that is what’s holding me back in sydney, my family here! I hate the feeling of choosing between living/seeing my parents often or my grandparents. I know what to do though which is swap, move near my parents & just visit my grandparents once a month instead, but then there’s Mickey.. I can’t leave her otherwise she misses me especially being blind I want to make sure she’s always extra okay, if you know me you know how much I love her🙈 (she can’t live with me cause she loves my grandma a lot too). SO why am I writing all this.. it does sound silly to me🙃 Maybe telling thousands of people what’s going on in my brain, I might feel less iffy about it & well it’s the reason why I haven’t moved.. also wrote too much for it to go to waste lol😅 BUT let’s take this as a reminder to see your family, speak to them often and tell them you love them daily❤️
user_9;user_9165.jpg;"Burrito, nourish bowl & strawberry smoothie🌱🍓🌈👅 If you told me years ago that I would one day be vegan, I would've laughed while shoving Mcdonalds down my throat. I didn't understand much about food, I ate what society is consumed by & never questioned it. I constantly felt sick & accepted it because it's ""normal"". If you know my #vegan story (it's in my story highlights & Q&A videos) waking up & realising why we do anything in life was a huge impact both mentally & physically. Why do we eat the things we do & why do we consume unnecessary violence. One thing that stuck with me when making the connection was how all animals will look into your eyes, you can connect & see someone not something.. they’re conscious beings. I love animals, don’t want to cause any harm to them & what I ate didn't align with my core values. Going vegan opened a whole new world of compassion + I got rid of those unpleasant problems like.. - PMS.. I would get excruciating cramps + vomit when I got my period. In the 3.5 years of being vegan I've had cramps only 3-4 times (during the times I ate really processed). My period is always regular & lighter too! - Cured my severe constipation & bloating💩 Not pooping regularly is zero fun🙅🏼‍♀️😂 - Increased energy! No more feeling sluggish after eating.. No wonder I always felt dead when that's all I was consuming. Eating a diet full of delicious foods makes me feel amazing from the inside out & so happy✨ There's no missing out on all your favourite foods either. Try including more plant based meals into your diet or even try out challenege22.com and I highly recommend reading ‘How Not To Die’ by Dr Greger plus watching ‘1000eyes’🌱 What's benefits have you experienced going vegan?

Thin crunchy potatoes, lettuce, black bean chilli, bell pepper, tomato, lots of avocado, hummus & coriander🌿 Potatoes are a great alternative to store bought tortilla chips for nachos as those are often loaded with unnecessary sodium & oils. Potatoes are also most satisfying & nutritious!

How to make: Preheat oven to 250 degrees celsius. 1. Toss potatoes in herbs/spices & lay out on a lined baking tray. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until golden & crunchy. 2. Place potatoes on a plate & layer on the chili + other ingredients then enjoy😛 Ingredients from @thesourceglebe #vegan
