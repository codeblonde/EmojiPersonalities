user_23;user_232.jpg;Vegan pizza with vegan cheese, delivered ❤️ things have come a long way, friends, can't wait to see what the next few years will offer for the vegan movement. The fact that this even exists means there has been a shift. Don't get me wrong, LONG WAY TO GO STILL. But we've also come a long way since the days I tried vegan soy yogurt for the first time in 2011 and almost barfed. And also the time I threw away vegan mayo cause it was gross. Now I can have delicious, non-gross, meat eater approved vegan pizzas delivered to my door (this is good in some ways, bad in some other ways) 😁 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #feedfeed #pizza #veganpizza #panago

user_23;user_238.jpg;Is veganism too expensive??? 😯 My short answer is NO 🙂 NEW BUDGET VEGAN MEAL PREP VIDEO is out now on my YouTube Channel 🌟 ⁣⠀ ⁣⠀ I've always been confused by this myth since I was always a cheap f*ck! LOL 😯 when I first went vegan, I had just moved to London, UK, one of the most expensive cities in the world. I was paying an arm and a leg for rent, but thankfully VEGAN GROCERIES ARE CHEAP, MY FRIENDS 😀 let me rephrase that: vegan groceries CAN BE cheap. Remember that vegans are still a small minority - in marketing terms, this is a small NICHE MARKET. Also, vegans are more likely to be in a privileged position (not to be confused with veganism BEING a privilege, but that's a different topic), meaning they are more likely to have money to spend 💰💰💰 this means that food that is marked VEGAN can be priced at a higher price point, as there is less to choose from (which is perhaps why a plate of fancy looking vegetables might cost you $20 at a restaurant) 🙄⁣⠀ ⁣⠀ BUT GOOD NEWS - vegan food doesn't have to be marked VEGAN for it to be vegan. Sticking to a predominantly whole foods plant based diet is the KEY to effortlessly saving money 🤑 rice, beans, lentils, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pasta, etc. are readily available in most places and are affordable ❤️⁣⠀ ⁣⠀ Today's meal prep video, I'm using affordable and budget friendly ingredients - money saving & time saving = its a win win 😁 Go to my YouTube Channel for the video and recipes 😍⁣⠀ ⁣⠀ #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #gamechangers #healthy #feedfeed #quarantinerecipes #mealprep #veganmealprep #veganmeals #foodprep #fitness #veganfitness

user_23;user_2321.jpg;"Yesterday, I saw a very powerful film (thanks to many recommendations) that I think everyone should watch. It was @netflix 13th (EDIT, just found out in the comments, this is available on @youtube right now for FREE. ANYONE CAN WATCH, PLEASE SHARE). I’ve known about police brutality & racial injustice to a certain degree, but this film explained so much more and tied things together that I didn’t know about. This film explains that it’s not just about a few police officers or even the police force - it’s about an ENTIRE SYSTEM that is fundamentally designed to incarcerate and incriminate people of colour. It started with slavery and now a different form of slavery exists under the guise of “justice”. It’s truly disturbing but it’s important to watch to understand the root of all of this.⁣ ⁣ Another recommendation is an episode of @netflix Explained - The Racial Wealth Gap (Season 1, Episode 3). This episode explains how slavery and other discriminatory practices have compounded through the years to create a huge racial wealth gap. The median wealth among white households in America is $171,000; among black households, it’s $17,600. This didn’t happen by accident. ⁣ ⁣ Other recommended shows/movies:⁣ 1. When They See Us ⁣ 2. Trial By Media (Episode: 41 Shots) ⁣ 3. Who Killed Malcolm X? (I only just started watching this but this was recommended by many)⁣ 4. Time: The Kalief Browder Story (I remember starting to watch this a few years ago and couldn’t finish because it was disturbing. Will watch again)⁣ ⁣ Please leave more recommendations in the comments ❤️⁣ ⁣ #blacklivesmatter #blm"

user_23;user_2326.jpg;"⁣ ⁣Recently, I watched Trial by Media on Netflix and one episode featured the story of Amadou Diallo, a young unarmed black man that got shot 41 times by police officers in front of his own home. The officers were acquitted. This happened in 1999.⁣ ⁣ Then I was listening to the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell which began with the story of Sandra Bland. She was a young woman who got pulled over for failing to signal while changing lanes. She wasn't as ""friendly"" as the police officer wanted her to be and he arrested her for no reason at all. Coincidentally, she was a vocal advocate for Black Lives Matter & spoke loudly about the injustices and police brutality that happen against black people in America. She was found hanged in her jail cell 3 days later - they say it was suicide. This was in 2015. ⁣ ⁣ This set me off on a spiral of watching video after video of police brutality against black people. Even though I’ve always known this was a problem, I was still astonished at how often this type of shit occurs. And how often police get away with it. ⁣ ⁣ When this story of George Floyd came up, I thought it was just another old story (since YouTube was recommending me similar videos)… How messed up is that? That I just thought it was yet another story of an innocent black man getting killed by the police? And this was probably the worst I've seen. This wasn't “self defense”, this wasn't resisting arrest... This was literally a handcuffed man begging for his life. And a man killing him while the rest of the officers just ignored. ⁣ ⁣ I don't really know what to say, other than for everyone to demand justice. This makes me so upset. I don't know how I could live in a country where I don't feel protected, but threatened, by the people who are supposed to protect me.﻿ No, I’m not white, but I’ve never felt threatened or in danger because of the colour of my skin. ⁣ ⁣ Please leave any resources for education, awareness, support, etc. below in the comments. I hope you are all staying safe & optimistic. ⁣ ⁣ Art by @nikkolas_smith⁣ ⁣ #georgefloyd #justiceforgeorgefloyd #blacklivesmatter #blm"

user_23;user_2332.jpg;Have you ever tried making a Mug Brownie? This is one of the fudgiest and best mug brownies I've made (to be fair, i haven't made one in a while so this study might be flawed but I'll still go with it) 😋 I'm going to attribute this to one major ingredient - TAHINI!!! Seems a bit strange but I'm telling you to try this RIGHT NOW. It is a deliciously moist, soft and fudgy chocolate brownie, ready to eat in just a few minutes and perfectly portioned for you ❤️ recipe is in my latest YouTube video 👌⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #gamechangers #healthy #feedfeed #quarantinerecipes #quarantine #comfortfood #quarantinefood #tahini #sweettooth

user_23;user_2335.jpg;"🌟 RECIPE 🌟 Air Fried Crispy Soy Curls (OR Tofu) 😁⠀ .⠀ The other day I wanted to make one of my recipes from my Everyday Asian Recipes eBook - the Sweet & Sour Tofu recipe. But instead of tofu, I decided that Soy Curls would be SUCH a great option (it becomes a great vegan imitation of the popular Korean dish - Tangsuyuk)!!! 😋 Soy Curls are basically dehydrated pieces of soy ""meat"" that you rehydrate by soaking in water and it can be used in so many different ways as a meat replacement. You can use this breading recipe for extra firm tofu as well, for crispy air fried tofu!❤️⠀ .⠀ .⠀ INGREDIENTS ▼⠀ ▸ 4 cups soy curls, dry⠀ ▸ 1 cup finely ground bread crumbs⠀ ▸ 1/2 cup flour (I used bread flour)⠀ ▸ 2 tbsp nutritional yeast⠀ ▸ 1 tsp each: garlic powder, pepper, salt😁⠀ -⠀ Batter ⠀ ▸ 1/2 cup flour⠀ ▸ 1 cup dairy free milk (or water) ⠀ ⁃⠀ Instructions:⠀ 1️⃣ Place soy curls in a large mixing bowl along with plenty of water to soak for at least 10 minutes. ⠀ 2️⃣ Mix together bread crumbs, flour, nutritional yeast and spices in a medium bowl.⠀ 3️⃣ In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and dairy free milk until smooth batter.⠀ 4️⃣ Take the rehydrated soy curls out, soak in the batter, shake off excess and place in bread crumb mixture to coat.⠀ 5️⃣ Once you've coated all soy curls, place in an air fryer for 12-15 minutes at 370 degrees F until its nice and crispy.⠀ 6️⃣ Serve with sauce of choice! Goes great with the Sweet & Sour Tofu Recipe (substitute for tofu) from my Everyday Asian Recipes eBook!

user_23;user_2347.jpg;"Easy way to reduce meat intake - simply substitute your meals that normally contain meat with plantbased protein options 😁 seems obvious, right? It really doesn't have to be complicated! Meat substitutes, beans, tofu, tempeh, soy curls, etc work amazingly as great substitutes to lower your carbon footprint and help you toward a more plantbased lifestyle 💕 I suggest making sure to substitute adequately instead of just eliminating foods, so you don't just end up with a plate of rice and vegetables (I'd be starving in an hour) 👌 There are literally countless sources of plantbased recipes on the internet. Take advantage! 👍 PS this is my Better Than Takeout Stir Fry recipe featured in my latest YouTube video ""what I ate in a day"" and it's glorious.

user_23;user_2371.jpg;"Tiger King is an entertaining show but there were a few aspects that bothered me in a lot of ways. The way they continuously drew the false equivalency between a roadside zoo to an accredited animal sanctuary that works to end the breeding and private ownership of animals was the main thing that bothered me. And the way that left out KEY information to intentionally make the sanctuary look hypocritical. One key piece of information is that Big Cat Rescue is ACCREDITED by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and has been for years. In order to be accredited, they MUST meet high standards for animal care. I'm not here to say that animal sanctuaries are perfect by any means but there were definitely some very unfair and false narratives pushed by this show that gives the viewer a wrong impression. Watch my latest YouTube video to hear more 🙏 EDIT: BCR also has received a 4 star rating (the highest rating) from Charity Navigator, and if you go to my stories, you can swipe up to see the page that goes through their income statement.

I hope you're all doing okay and practicing social distancing as much as you can 💜 I'm taking advantage of the extra time I have to do things I normally don't give myself time to do... For instance... I just baked these cookies out of almond pulp (the pulp left over from making almond milk, video coming soon...) and I wanted to share the recipe! It's modified from a blog called Berry & Maple because the original recipe was a bit too wet (I think this all depends on how wet your pulp is! Mine was a bit wet so thats probably why) 😊 . . here's the recipe 💕 . Ingredients🔻 🔹 1 cup wet almond pulp 🔹 1 cup shredded coconut 🔹 1/3 cup maple syrup or agave nectar 🔹 1/2 cup vegan friendly chocolate chips 🔹 2-3 tbsp flour (depending on how wet the pulp is) 🔹 2 tbsp peanut or almond butter . Instructions 🔻 1️⃣ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F 2️⃣ Mix all ingredients in a mixing bowl 3️⃣ Grease a baking sheet or cover with parchment paper or a reusable baking liner (you can get them off Amazon - better for the environment!) 4️⃣ Spoon the dough and press into cookie shapes 5️⃣ Bake for approximately 20-30 minutes or until golden 6️⃣ Let cool down for about 10 minutes (this will let them come together more) and devour!💕 . .

user_23;user_23107.jpg;"My frustrated face when I talk about the annoying things about being vegan... Lol I do believe that for good vegan advocacy, it's important to be rational, logical and not let our emotions get in the way but people often forget that vegans are human, too. For those that don't get why vegans are ""preachy"" and maybe even ""angry"", please try and understand our perspective. Think about how emotional and passionately angry you get when you see someone abusing a cat or a dog and ask yourself what the difference is between that and vegans getting passionate and angry about other forms of animal abuse that happen to billions everyday (not to mention the crazy amount of environmental destruction that is caused by animal agriculture too). You might not see it the same way because culturally, we've accepted some animals as being worthy of our love and affection while putting others in a different category, but at the end of the day, suffering is suffering. Us vegans see it the same way. Yet, because what we are advocating for is the end of ALL animal exploitation and this makes people uncomfortable because that means they need to look inward at their own lifestyle choices, vegans are often ridiculed, ostracized and seen as ""preachy"". Vegans are seen as extreme, yet the guy saving a duck from getting hit by a car then going to eat a pig for dinner is seen as a hero. So yes, while I still try my best to meet people where they are, praise even the smallest improvements, and be understanding and kind when promoting veganism, the frustration kicks in sometimes when I think about how hypocritical the world is 😑 Anyway, if you wanna hear me vent about other annoyances of being vegan, go to my latest YouTube video 😅 if you are sensitive to F bombs, you might not like it 😁 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #vegantalks #vegansupportgroup #vegansofinstagram"

Watch it on my YouTube channel now ~ but here's a nice photo of @savegyyc No Eggs Benny so you have something nice to look at before you hear me rant lol😂 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #feedfeed #savegcafe #saveg
user_23;user_23109.jpg;SABICH!!! 😮 I need this back in my life. This is a popular Israeli street food, which consists of a pita stuffed with all kinds of goodness - fried eggplant, veggies, tahini, etc... It also comes with egg but get it without and it's vegan! 😍 Sooo yummy and VERY messy. Probably not best to eat it on a first date situation but hey, I still would 😅😂 Thanks @vibeisrael (#gifted) for introducing me to this deliciousness ❤️ oh and if you wanna make it yourself, the wonderful @anettvelsberg already has a recipe up that you could try!! Now one day, I'll be less lazy and ill make it too... 😏👌 .

user_23;user_23155.jpg;It's LUNAR NEW YEAR this weekend! 🎉 This is one of the biggest celebrations in East Asia and us Koreans like to celebrate by eating a big bowl of Korean rice cake soup aka Tteokguk 😁 this is a savoury broth filled with mostly thinly sliced rice cakes and a few other simple ingredients - the version I made is 100% vegan and sooo delicious. The recipe is available already on my YouTube channel 👍 trust me, you'll want to try this if you love Asian food ❤️ tteokguk has been traditionally consumed in Korea for many many years and it is still a tradition many Koreans live by - eating a bowl of this goodness every new year (I'd eat it any time of year though). Apparently the white rice cakes symbolizes purity and cleanliness and a fresh start for the new year and the coin-like shape of the rice cakes, which resembles Korea's old currency, symbolizes prosperity 😋 so eat your tteokguk, kids 😍 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #koreanfood #tteokguk #떡국 #설날 #newyear #lunarnewyear #koreanrecipe #veganrecipes

user_23;user_23164.jpg;🌟NEW VIDEO 🌟something a little different today... A bit over a month ago, I did a little meditation challenge where I challenged myself to meditate everyday for 20 minutes a day. I've been interested in and dabbling in meditation for a while but I've never done a challenge and I was not used to meditating for 20 minutes at a time 😮⁠ ⁠ For those of you wondering why anyone would choose to meditate (when they're not spiritual or religious), there are many science backed reasons to do so. If you watch the new YouTube video, I listed a few different links in my description box to get more information 👍🏻⁠ ⁠ Long story short, a regular meditation practice is used to improve mindfulness. Mindfulness is the psychological process of purposely bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment without judgment, which one can develop through the practice of meditation and through other training (thanks, Wiki!). Research has shown that mindfulness is one of the key ingredients to happiness! 😁And isn't that what most people want? To be happy? 😊⁠ ⁠ Meditation has been linked to helping with stress, anxiety and even depression and has a giant list of potential benefits when practiced regularly. I see it as an exercise for your mind. We exercise our bodies on a regular basis (or at least we should...) so why should we neglect our mind? 🤷🏻⁠ ⁠ Anyway, go watch the video on my YouTube channel to see how my month went! ♥️⁠ .⁠ .⁠ .⁠ #user_23 #vegan #meditation #meditating #meditate #mindfulness #youtuber #youtube #challenge #veganism ⁠ ⁠

user_23;user_23167.jpg;One of the challenges you get when you go vegan is the endless questioning from family and friends. 'Why'd you go vegan?' 'Why the sudden change?' 'So you can't eat out with us anymore, right?' So many questions! I get how stressful it can get!⁠ .⁠ One tip I can give you is to know your 'WHY.' The clearer your reason is on why you decided to go vegan, the more confident you'll be in answering these questions! It could be you went vegan for health reasons, or (like me) for ethical reasons! Being clear on WHY you are a vegan helps send the message that you are actually serious and that you're not just jumping on a trend. Makes huge sense, right? 😁⁠ .⁠ I posted 3 more tips on my blog for going vegan for the New Year, but you can find even more tips not just from me but from several other vegan influencers by buying the Vegan Bundle!⁠ 😆⁠ .⁠ I've been posting about this since last week, but now that there are only 2 days left to get the deal, I just had to mention this here for anyone who has been thinking of buying but hasn't done so yet.

user_23;user_23179.jpg;Simplicity ❤️ Lots of people think of vegan food or vegan meals as something they'd have a hard time considering eating or something they've never ate before... The fact is that vegan food is just food minus animal products 😂 if you've had avocado on toast, peanut butter and banana sandwich, oatmeal w non dairy milk, chips and guac, fruit, nuts, etc, you've definitely had vegan meals and food before 🤗 if you find it difficult, start with one meal a day - how about breakfast?! 😉 No need to complicate things - take some toast, smash some avo, add some tomato (I also added some tempeh on top) and voila! 👍 Who else loves breakfast? What are your fave plantbased breakfast options? 😀 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #feedfeed #veganmukbang #breakfast #veganbreakfast #thegamechangers
user_23;user_23180.jpg;When Mama Lee's away, Rose will play... In the kitchen 😉 This was my attempt at a Korean inspired vegan christmas feast! Nowhere near my mama's skills but she taught me the beauty of home cooking and working hard to create a large feast! ❤️ It's also thanks to YouTube that sort of forced me to learn how to cook (I didn't really intend on being a cooking channel but the viewers kinda steered me into this direction lmao) 😊 and boy am I glad, cause I've learnt so much! Hope you got to play a little in the kitchen too this year and made some yummy food. I encourage you to have more feasts and spend more precious time with loved ones on other days of the year and not just during this season! ❤️ I hope you had a fantastic holiday and if you didn't, hey, it's pretty much over 😏👏 . . . #user_23 #vegan #vegansofig #veganism #veganeats #veganfoodie #foodie #veganfoodporn #foodporn #whatveganseat #plantbased #plantstrong #vegandiet #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #veganfoodshare #foodgasm #foodshare #feedfeed #plantbased #gamechangers #thegamechangers

user_23;user_23193.jpg;SAUCE QUEEN!! 😜😍 who else loves their food with a lot of sauce?! This is a dish from my vegan cafe @savegyyc using an amazing house made Korean style spicy sauce - this is a recipe brought down from my auntie who used to own a fried chicken shop in Korea.

user_23;user_23194.jpg;"Did you know sweetened red beans are used often in Asian desserts? It's a huge thing in Asia and even though it might sound weird to others, it's absolutely delicious in so many things! 😋One of the treats I remember eating in Korea as a kid was a thing called ""Walnut Snacks"" aka Hodugwaja. It's a type of pastry sold as street food in the winter months - filled with walnuts and red bean paste and shaped like a walnut! 👍It was one of my favourite street foods as a kid and I wanted to recreate the taste (veganize it too) but make it accessible to anyone without having a ""walnut shape waffle maker"" lol. So I decided to make them into mini pancakes stuffed with walnut & sweetened red beans (you can get the red bean stuff in Asian supermarkets or substitute with a filling of your choice like peanut butter or a vegan nutella) 😁This is one of my favourite creations from my Everyday Asian Recipes eBook - get the full recipe for this dessert by clicking the link in my bio to visit my shop ❤️⁠ .⁠ .⁠ .⁠ #user_23 #everydayasianrecipes #clvasian #clv #veganism #vegan #bestofvegan #veganfood #whatveganseat #whatvegansmake #veganrecipe #koreanvegan #asianvegan #vegetarian #goveg #plantbased #gamechangers #plantbasedrecipes #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #vegankorea #vegankorean"
