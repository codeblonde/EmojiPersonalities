user_18;user_180.jpg;"What are you grateful for today?🙏🏽 . . . For me, today I'm mega excited about finally getting to e-meet my entire Summer e-course #foodphotography student group! 🥳🥳🥳 . . . Teaching is my LIFE and being able to share what I love so much with creatives from around the world will always hold a special place in my heart❤️; it's SO exciting to see everyone find their voice and that inner confidence to show up as their unique creative being💥. . . . But that begs the question, how can we avoid imitating the creatives we admire and instead find our own style 💪🏽? And, moreover does having a recogniseable strong, personal #foodphotography style actually matter? 🤔 . . . These are just some of the things I discuss in some depth this week on the #eatcaptureshare podcast (48), so if you've not listened in yet, please do. I'll pop the link in my bio and on stories for an easy swipe up and also post the link below 🥰. . . . IMAGE INFO: #vegan blondie trilogy complete (see previous 2 posts for part 1 and 2). I seldom make something as photogenic as baked goods, so when I do I usually try lots of different camera settings, backdrops and stories to give each photo version a different feel. I call it playtime 🙈. . . . Shot on @canonuk 5D mark iii, 24-70mm lens, 1/25 - F5 - ISO200. Edited with TLP hazy concrete + preset from my COMPLETE Lightroom collection.

user_18;user_181.jpg;WARNING! This is not a post about #vegan blondies.✊🏽 . . . I’m also not going to tell you how messed up things are at the moment because I know you know and more importantly I’m trying to focus on positive ways forward 💪🏽💥. . . . 💓So with that in mind I’d like you to know that NOW is the time to send waves of positive energy into the world cuz DANG the world needs it. Together with beautiful strangers, foodie friends and talented creatives, we’re working on something pretty cool behind the scenes but we need YOU to make it happen.💓 . . . We’re looking for someone to help us put together a 3 minute IGTV video to launch our project next month😅. Please note, this is a not-for-profit creative collective project with a mission to promote positivity, creativity and a strong anti-racist message. Does this sound like something you’d like to support with your knowledge and creative talent? 💥💥💥 . . . If you want to do something and know how to edit videos for IGTV, I’d love to hear from you. We need you 💓. Please DM me for further info. Thank you 🙏🏽. . . . #calledtobecreative #creativityfound #eatcaptureshare #communityovercompetition
user_18;user_182.jpg;Does anyone actually care about what I have to say? Do I have anything unique to offer? 🙈 . . . Is it a smart move to be more vulnerable on instagram and share more personal content?🤔 . . . Is it really that important to have your own unique food photography style🤓? . . . How can I grow on instagram TODAY?😎 . . . These questions may seem random, but they are all CONNECTED and are some of YOUR most frequently asked questions💥.

I shot these blondies 3 different ways for kicks and because the light was just so dreamy and again, why not?! 😆I'll share some of the other shots soon🥰. FYI we all had 1 blondie square with #plantbased hemp yoghurt to balance out the sweetness with some acidity. The tiny bit of cherry compote was solely for photography purposes. The rest was frozen for a rainy day 😋🙃. . . BTW if you don't like your blondies (or brownies) gooey, I don't think things are gonna work out between us💁🏽‍♀️. Just sayin'. 😆 .

user_18;user_183.jpg;When’s the last time you did something that scared you as a creative?🤔 . . . Yesterday I sent 2 cover options for my book on #foodstyling to my mailing list and asked my subscribers to choose their favourite one🥰. Initially I was pretty relaxed about it 😎, but on the day, yesterday I actually almost cried😅. What if the covers tanked and no one liked them after MONTHS!!! of working on them together with my dream team @evoller and @thebrand_stylist . I was SO nervous 😬 . I pressed send anyway, hoping for the best 🤞🏽. . . . Then I actually properly cried 😭as I got about 50 emails 🙈 and over a hundred lovely comments on the book covers from my creative community all filled with thoughtful, considered feedback. Wow, I was blown away🙏🏽. THANK YOU everyone for your support and for caring about this creative project at a time where I wondered if anyone actually still wanted to hear about this book 🙈. At a time where I was doubting myself and unsure if I can pull this whole thing off without the backing of a publisher ☺️. . . . I’ll reveal the winning cover on the blog soon and share more of the ENTIRE creative process, as well as why the cover design took so much time and consideration😅. In the interim I’ll leave you with an older but rather delicious flatlay😘.

user_18;user_185.jpg;"Is your editing letting your photography down? 🙈 . . I see so many talented photographers and #eatcaptureshare challenge participants stumble at the final hurdle and not put the same amount of time and effort into their editing as they would in the food styling or composition. 🧐😘 . . . Like everything, the devil is in the detail; Lightroom can be really overwhelming so stepping into that creative space with focus and intention is everything💪🏽. . . Even is you use filters or presets, knowing HOW to adjust and adapt them to suit your brand is SO important especially if you want to create a recogniseable and sought after style all your own. . .

user_18;user_187.jpg;Do you share what’s in your heart here on instagram?💓 . . Generally I don’t. I focus on offering value and teaching as much as I can about #foodphotography and #foodstyling💪🏽, but I’ve wondered if that’s actually enough and a true and authentic reflection of where I am on my creative path.✨ . . Since the lockdown I’ve noticed that I’ve personally gravitated more towards instagram accounts that go beyond the cute picture and recipe captions and contain more thought provoking content that shows heart, vulnerability, a touch of inspiration and a good dose of bravery⭐️. I feel a call to head in the same direction. . . No worries, this account will continue to focus on the content I’ve shared over the last 6 years (#vegan food photography, #plantbased recipes and creative business and instagram tips), but hopefully with added depth and much more risk taking! ☺️ . . Have you also questioned how you wanna show up here going forward? Does it feel scary to share more of you? . . IMAGE INFO: Speaking of risks, this almond and date syrup cake is the first image I’ve taken in weeks! The cake was SO UNATTRACTIVE, but I wanted to push myself and see if I could make it work. The rose petals were me cheating🙈, but they brought a feminine touch to the shot and just about made it look as delicious as it tasted 😅. Edited with TLP dark green wood Lightroom preset from the ESSENTIAL and COMPLETE collection. Shot on @canonuk 5D mark iii, 50mm lens, 1/100 - F5 - ISO160.
user_18;user_188.jpg;It's been nearly 2 weeks since George Floyd was brutally murdered and the wounds caused from watching those scenes of horror are still there, wide open, with no signs of healing anytime soon. . They hurt so much, NOT because this is the first time I've seen police brutality against a black brother, NOT because I wasn't fully aware of the extent of oppression and racism, NOT because that could have been my brother, my grandfather, my uncle, but because it's the first time I've allowed myself to sit with the grief and upset at a point in time where I (all of us?) was already feeling rather raw. That's been an intense experience. . I know our time of reflection on IG will officially end tomorrow, but to be honest it's going to take a LONG time to get over this, if ever I can. .  I want to show up for you, I want to show up for my business & @iamtabithabrown and @hailethomas have shown me it's possible to mourn AND take up space on IG as powerful, strong, compassionate, creative beings. But, I also know self care is essential right now, so I'm going to take it one step at a time. This may mean days/weeks of quiet, more sporadic posts, or more personal posts like this one. Perhaps I'll plough my energy into a whole other creative project. I don't know yet, I'll let my heart guide me. . . To all of you who have sat in this discomfort with the BIPOC community, who have marched, donated, prayed, had the difficult conversations and started the deep reflection and learning. THANK YOU, I know it's been tough and has taken its toll, has brought up old wounds or made way for brand new ones. But kind of like this image, when you least expect it, the sunshine will break through the clouds, justice will be served, we just gotta keep doing the work to make that happen. And I am hopeful that this time, collectively, we will. .  P.S. I am thinking of arranging a (FREE OBVI!!!!) ZOOM call for those of us in the food space to come together and provide one another with mutual support and a space to chat, outside our family/friend circles because I know there's been some disturbing content even within our much loved food space. This is open everyone. DM me if you’re interested 🙏🏽
user_18;user_189.jpg;Want to hear a beautifully powerful female voice of hope during these times of turmoil and pain? ✨ . . I had the honour of speaking to @palestineonaplate a few weeks ago on the #eatcaptureshare podcast about finding strength during periods of despair, using our creative talents and love of food to support the forgotten and oppressed and how speaking your truth helps spread joy even in the darkest of hours💓. . . When we recorded the episode neither of us had any knowledge of the injustices and police brutality that would once again unfold right in front of our eyes. These injustices by people with power happen ALL THE TIME and @palestineonaplate’s message should ALWAYS be amplified! But airing the episode at THIS pivotal moment felt especially relevant and necessary. 🙏🏽 . . It’s an uplifting and inspiring episode full of examples of how @palestineonaplate is making a difference and how YOU can too!

user_18;user_1810.jpg;I'm a brown immigrant woman and I wouldn't want it any other way! 💪🏽 . . I have always lived in predominantly white cultures, I now work in a field that is dominated by white people and even the hobbies I pursue (hi yoga) mean that I'm ALWAYS a minority.🙋🏽‍♀️ . And though some of my best friends are white women, I have always felt SO lucky to have brown skin💁🏽‍♀️. . Being a POC means I have always had to work harder to achieve the same things my white colleagues get🧐. I’ve never been bitter about it, instead it has simply resulted in an INSANE work ethic, which has meant I have ALWAYS been Valedictorian and hence got a one way ticket into Oxford where I graduated top of my class👩🏽‍🎓. All this to prove to everyone that POC like me ARE WORTHY AND ABLE!!!! It also means I can proudly say that my #eatcaptureshare photography challenge is one of the BEST ones on this platform and my ecourse one of the best you'll ever sign up to because I usually out work everyone in this space. 💥 . . Being a POC means that empathy is my secret weapon💓, my super power, the thing that really makes me who I am here on social media and IRL. I am SO grateful that the pain and suffering I've experienced have allowed me to develop a heart 💕that beats a little bit harder than most other people. It's a gift I am so grateful for. 🙏🏽 . Being a POC in the position I'm in means I feel I can serve my community best, NOT by expressing hollow outrage, but by taking action. In 2017 I was one of the organisers of the Women's March on London, which was a life changing experience, but nearly broke me. I'm in different season of my life now and feel that the best thing I can do is to continue to show other POC that WE CAN CLAIM SPACE, that we are allowed to be successful and darn good at what we do AND more importantly to donate a percentage of my earnings to the causes that matter💵. I have done so all this season, quietly, because I hate the self serving, loud pat on the back fund raising shit that I've seen doing the rounds here. But I wanted the POC community to know, that I see what's going on, I feel your pain and I'm doing all I can to support those of you on the ground. Continue..
user_18;user_1811.jpg;"All I ever wanted was to show how beautiful #plantbased foods are. 💕🌱💓 . . . Not the insane (and surely delicious) sky-scraper high nana ice cream jars, not the too-big-to-hold stop-your-scroll veggie burgers🍔, the fancy (and oh so pretty) vegan cheesecakes 🎂or all the other stuff you can find on the most beautiful #vegan instagram pages. Instead, I always dreamed of showcasing the simple, humble, everyday foods that me and my family really eat☺️. Perhaps these are the foods that you eat on the daily too - uncomplicated stews, flavourful soups, a bowl of fresh fruit, THAT oaty breakfast.😋 . . . I love how there is space for every taste (literally😆) on instagram, but my heart will always beat for the unassuming underdog in real life, and definitely in food. . . . Though I must confess, it's very tempting to do what is popular and what gets most likes💓, I know I wouldn't be honest with myself or you if I did the former, which is cool and inspiring, but just not ‘me’ ☺️. So I'll stick to showing that everyday real, plant-based foods, snacks, meals and (my fav) breakfasts (PLUS the occasional show stopper cake of course ;)) 💪🏽can be super cute💁🏽‍♀️. How does that sound? 💓 . . IMAGE INFO: So excited that all the fresh colourful fruits are coming into season.

user_18;user_1814.jpg;Super easy #vegan pancake recipe using pantry staples, who is in?😋 . . . There are countless food blogs on the internet, but few create content that’s unforgettable, content that is visually stunning as well as insanely inspiring. One of those blogs is @bethkirby ‘s Local Milk Blog. In fact, Beth’s content played a big part in my decision to pursue a career in #foodphotography and I’m therefore SO chuffed that she asked me to create a guest post for her! ☺️ . . . I wanted to keep things easy, uncomplicated and down to earth to reflect the state of the world.

user_18;user_1815.jpg;Are you never quite happy with your photography? Are you your own worst critic? 🧐🙋🏽‍♀️ . . . Though a desire to improve your work and recognise where you still need to grow and evolve is important💪🏽, being kind to yourself is too 🙏🏽. I believe that if we’re too critical of our images, our captions, our cooking skills, OURSELVES, it can cause us to simply repeatedly do what we already know and what feels ‘safe’ but also stop us from trying (and failing at) something new and fun😔. Yet it’s the latter combined with a shift in mindset 🤓that allows us to truly grow.⭐️ . . . That’s why this week on the #eatcaptureshare podcast I mentor @moysglutenfreekitchen and we explore how her mindset is holding her back from speaking her truth on instagram and growing her baking business the way I know she can. 🥰Moy is being incredibly brave and vulnerable in the episode, which I know will help so many of you 💓. . . .

user_18;user_1816.jpg;"When the pandemic started I thought no one would EVER sign up for my ecourse and in fact I wasn’t gonna run it at all. 🙈 . . . Moreover, I had SO many mixed emotions about the idea of selling during a global health emergency. I’ve written about it in my newsletter and talked about it on stories too so I won’t bore you here with all my middle class guilt stuff, but I can now honestly say, launching the ecourse, despite all the turmoil and chaos was, hands down, one of the BEST decisions I’ve ever made 🙏🏽. . . . Going through this crisis as a group of supportive creatives has been a unique and very bonding experience that I wouldn’t want to change for anything✨. It also allowed me to get to know students @brekkie_byclo and @oliver.fox__ , both incredibly driven, hardworking creatives who I KNOW will go far 💪🏽. Their ambition is INSPIRING and their vision and focus crystal clear. Go check them out and follow their journey because I KNOW they’ll provide you with great content now that will continue to evolve as the course progresses because that’s the kind of creatives they are💪🏽⭐️. . . .

user_18;user_1818.jpg;Are you holding back on instagram? Stopping yourself from really sharing the content or message you want, afraid it’ll look like you’re bragging or that people will ‘discover’ that you’re an imposter 🙈? . . . If you think people whose work you love don’t struggle with the above, then I’ve got news for you: They probably do! In fact, most creatives and food photographers I know question their worth and place on this crowded platform ALL.THE.TIME. The thing is, what can we do to push through these limiting beliefs and do what we really want to anyway? 💪🏽 . . . That’s what I explore in my 1-2-1 instagram coaching session with @moysglutenfreekitchen which I recorded so I could share it with you on the #eatcaptureshare podcast this week💕! I know these are your favourite episodes to listen to and I sure hope this one will give you some ideas and inspiration✨. . . . .

They are working their butts off and supporting one another like I’ve never seen💪🏽. It’s been SO inspiring😭💓. . . . So much freakin’ talent and heart in this group I’m blown away and I’d love you to know them and see all the things they are doing because they deserve to be noticed⭐️! . . . @tootingmama just had a break through in her study of light and shadow and it’s allowing her to take her images to the next level, @the.unstoppable.soul is starting to recognise what style she loves and is now honing in on that, @oscardarling ‘s love of food is palpable and I can see hard work and immense progress in her work, week by week. @daisydefretes shared an insanely gorgeous image in our student Facebook group and I CANNOT believe she’s only just started on this journey. And we’re only 3 weeks in! . . . I’ll share more student stories soon because they are ALL uniquely gifted and so passionate, but just wanted to say that now here cuz it felt right in the moment. . . .

user_18;user_1821.jpg;I miss shooting for clients with my team so much. I miss hanging out at @theshalalondon and @london_community_boxing which just made life that extra bit better 🙏🏽✨. I miss the little rituals my son and I had on our way to and from his school and I miss the sense of freedom and the endless possibilities the day could bring ✨. . . . And though I find it important to reminisce about all that’s gone before, I find it more grounding to be in the moment and think about all the things that CAN be now, here, today☺️. . . . I don’t know what the future holds, but I refuse to stop dreaming and planning and creating and crafting my destiny in the best way I can. And that feels good and empowering and hopeful, especially on the days when things just feel blah🥺. . . . What’s helping you through? How are you finding strength to keep going and smiling and, dare I say, thriving💪🏽? I’d love to know 💕💕💕💕. I hope you’re well.

Have you turned to the comfort foods of your childhood, has the act of cooking brought a rhythm and structure to your day or are you stress eating like no one’s business? 🙈 . . .

user_18;user_1823.jpg;You can’t shoot light images, you only do dark and moody!🤔 . . . I remember last year I got an email to that effect. Someone was concerned I couldn’t teach them how to shoot light images as they felt my IG was so dark.🤷🏽‍♀️ . . . I thought this was so interesting because to me once you understand light and shadow work and all its nuances AND have got a solid grasp on editing, ANYTHING is possible 💪🏽✨. . . . For example, this image was shot on a SUPER bright 🌞day, against a cream wall on a light backdrop using light props. Nothing else was used. I then applied my TLP dark green wood preset from my new COMPLETE Lightroom preset pack and that’s it. ✨✨✨ . . To show how a preset can change the mood, tone, feel, colour and temperature of your image I applied a few of my other presets from the COMPLETE pack without changing exposure or white balance or anything. ✨✨✨ . . . I designed the Lightroom pack so that YOU can take your photography whichever way you want you, no need to choose camp dark and moody or light and bright because I believe you can do it all if you want to😘. . To celebrate the launch of my LIGHT and COMPLETE Lightroom preset packs, you can claim 10% off for a limited time only 🏃🏽‍♀️.

user_18;user_1828.jpg;"What I’d describe as ‘simple pleasures’ has changed significantly since the pandemic started. ☺️ . . . Whereas before anything to do with ME, for ME, felt great; now buying a new cookbook (@cheftomhunt), some cupboard staples (@clearspringuk) and fresh fruit and veg (@abelandcole @farmdrop) WITHOUT using the supermarkets or Amazon and going direct to the creators or independent providers (@rye_books) makes me SO happy. Honestly, it feels so good and has shown me it’s possible here in London, all the time and always! 🥳💃🏽 . . . I also changed to @goodenergyuk yesterday and embarrassingly I’ve meant to do this for YEARS🙈, just never found the time. When I signed on the virtual dotted line I wanted to do a little victory dance 💃🏽 💃🏽💃🏽. I kid you not🙈. It’s SUCH a small, simple pleasure, but it feels like a big deal right now. Just minor victories, you know, but they are EVERYTHING when the world is spinning in ways you can’t recognise 😔. . . . . I can’t change what’s going on beyond the walls of my home, but I CAN take baby steps and put my freakin’ privilege to good use 😆. I’m not suggesting ME time is lesser than and am most certainly not looking for a pat on the back😖. I’m just sharing where my heart 💓 and mind are genuinely at right now and what keeps me going and keeps me hopeful. 💪🏽 How about you?

user_18;user_1829.jpg;"Are you a morning bird 🐦 or night owl 🦉? . . .

Even on weekends I allow my internal clock to wake me super early and empower me to step into my day well before anyone in the house has even contemplated opening their eyes. It’s annoying, I know.

IMAGE INFO: Today’s #vegan lunch. I’ve spoken openly with @shisodelicious on the #eatcaptureshare podcast this week about my struggles with sharing overly styled food, abundance, all the things on IG during this rather crazy time. Anything other than real, raw and honest food somehow hurts my soul right now🙈. It doesn’t mean I don’t want to continue to show how darn sexy #plantbased foods are because it’s an important message that needs to get out now more than ever🙏🏽. It just means I’m keeping it simple, without the frills. Thank you for allowing me to share all the brown food 😬. Edited with TLP hazy concrete preset (as yet unreleased). 1/125 - F6.3 - ISO250 . . . . #creativityfound #veganuk #foodandwine #lifeandthyme #whatveganseat #bestofvegan #thatsdarling #f52grams #beautifulcuisines #hautecuisines #eattheworld #huffposttaste #gatheringslikethese #vegansofinstagram #eattherainbow #eatmoreplants #bombesquad #bbcgoodfood #wfpb #healthylifestyle #flatlayforever #foodphotography #foodstyling
user_18;user_1835.jpg;I don’t like getting vulnerable or sharing too much about what’s inside my heart. Do you?🙈 . . . I’m still VERY wary of cctv, tracking devices and oversharing in public because, gosh, who knows where it’ll all end (I know it’s a topic for a whole other day) BUT I do get raw and vulnerable and personal in today’s #eatcaptureshare podcast episode (42) and within that context it felt right 🙏🏽. . . . With my wonderful guest @shisodelicious we talk about how the quarantine has made space for courage, reflection and creativity. We talk about eating for the planet, #plantbased living, #foodphotography during this crisis and so much more. . . . It was a joy speaking to the wise @shisodelicious and I hope you have the time to tune in ✨.

I’m not a frosting kinda girl, but this homemade hazelnut chocolate vegan ganache was a lovely addition. TBH we’ve bucked the trend and barely baked in quarantine at all cuz there’s no flour and too much sweetness sends my head into a spin 🙈, so I’m using what I have got only when the bananas are extra brown and practically begging to be baked😅. (BTW 1/2 of this batch went to a neighbour. I traded it for lemons 😆. Oh and social distancing strictly observed during the trade 😬). . . . I’ve also taken quarantine as an invitation to really focus on fine tuning my food styling and capturing our real food without relying on anything extra, elaborate or fancy. It’s been challenging AF but also such a privilege to push the boat out. CREATIVITY was my word of the year after all, now I just gotta honour it 🙏🏽.

user_18;user_1842.jpg;Tomorrow I launch my #foodphotography online course AND my free #eatcaptureshare challenge. 💓 . . . Neither were on my vision board for Spring 2020 to be honest and it took me a little while to feel ‘right’ about unleashing both into the world☺️. After some soul searching, reflection and the beautiful power of time I now strongly believe both NEED to happen 🙏🏽. In part because YOU asked for them, but also because I know creativity, community and beauty can bring so much joy especially in times like these. Just as singers shouldn’t stop sharing their songs, poets shouldn’t stop sharing their words, we shouldn’t stop sharing our gifts either.💓 . . . BUT for me it’s important we share images of food in a mindful, respectful and appropriate way💪🏽. I hope the manner I’ve designed the course and the challenge allow for us to enjoy creativity in the most inclusive way possible whilst also being sensitive to the situation we find ourselves in. 🤞🏽✨ . . . I’ll let you be the judges of whether I managed ok 🙈. Tomorrow. On the blog. See you there 😘. . . . IMAGE INFO: Shot a few months ago for @bioandmeuk @theguthealthdoctor .

I wake up in the middle of the night and try to find a bigger meaning to it all, to use it as an opportunity to come out of this a better person. Do you ask yourself those questions too? . . . I’m not afraid anymore, at least not for the immediate here and now.

All to keep feeling like I have a purpose and am contributing to the wider good somehow, cuz it fuels me and stops me from going totally mad 🙈💪🏽. How are you spending your time? I’d love to know💓. . . . . P.S. Any quarantine movie recommendations? It’s officially date night in🍿🙏🏽. . . . . #wherewomencreate #veganuk #vegansofinstagram #vegansofig #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #user_18 #lovetrumpshate #darlingweekend #foodandwine #eattheworld #plantbased #poweredbyplants #tcmlivingwell #mindbodygreen #londonvegan #eatyourgreens #darlingweekend #thatsdarling #foodstyling #vegan
user_18;user_1853.jpg;"Anyone else wasting less food? 💪🏽 . . . I’m generally SUPER mindful when it comes to food waste, but since Corona decided to hit UK shores without an invitation (SO RUDE!), I’m in 0 waste overdrive. Can you relate? 🙋🏽‍♀️ . . . The weirdest thing is I’m enjoying the challenge of planning what I cook down to a T 👩🏽‍💻, making the most of left-overs and being creative with random odds and ends ☺️. I’m also cooking less (just what we need), snacking less (cuz it’s just not necessary right now) and freezing waaaay more (sauces, soups and such)💪🏽. . . . I love being frugal 💷 for sure, but I also don’t wanna go into stockpile mode; cooking with care makes me feel like I don’t have to and allows me to stay focused on buying fresh seasonal #plantbased produce 🥬🍐🥦rather than stacking up on long shelf life goods, which I’d love to leave for those members of the community who really need them🙏🏽. . . . That said, there were some lush and indulgent left-over #vegan mini pains au chocolat from a shoot I did for @laboulangere.uk a few weeks ago in our pantry and this morning we each had two😋😋😋, with a hot herbal tea and fresh orange slices. Man it hit the spot! #silverlining #zerowasteliving . . . Got any 0 waste cooking ideas you’d love to share? I’m all ear! 👂 . . . IMAGE INFO: Shot for @laboulangere.uk .

user_18;user_1854.jpg;Today was a good day! ✨✨✨ . . . After self isolating since Friday we went for a quick run in the park today 🏃🏽‍♀️and already the world looks brighter✨. It was pretty empty, which was great 😅 #socialdistancing 🙈. Now I’m prepping for my online class this Saturday💪🏽, arranging virtual playdates for my son 💓and focusing just on the things I can control and impact (such as doing my bit to keep that bl**dy curve down). . . . I’m sure there will be many more rotten days to come, but gotta celebrate the little wins, right? . . . Anything that made you smile today, PLEASE share. I heard the virus doesn’t like happy, chatty people 😘. 💓💓💓💓#silverlining . . . . . #communityfirst #eatcaptureshare #communityovercompetition #thatsdarling #vegan #veganuk #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #veganbreakfast #eattherainbow #creativityfound #hautecuisines #feedfeed #f52grams #bombesquad #bbcgoodfood #canonuk #bestofvegan #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #whatveganseat #foodandwine #lovetrumpshate #plantbased #wfpb #foodphotography #foodstyling
user_18;user_1855.jpg;I won’t allow myself to cry, at least not now when my feisty 10-year-old needs me. 💪🏽 . . . We’re together and that’s all I can ask for and it’s the thing I’m most grateful for, for sure ✨. . . . Though the UK government has been slow to respond it finally feels like they are taking matters more seriously, which is reassuring. . . . Where are you based, what’s your government doing and how on earth are you stopping yourself from refreshing the newspage on your phone every two seconds? Tips welcome 😆! . . . . To be extra safe we’ve kept our son home (he has a mild cough which I’m sure is fine, but I just don’t want to risk anything) and I’m in homeschooling mode whilst I put all things TLP on hold (except for my online course, a possible 1-week IG challenge and a special podcast episode 🤞🏽). Anyone else gone from entrepreneur to full-time teacher? 🙋🏽‍♀️ Boredom fighting ideas welcome. . . . P.S. I’d love us all to stay connected and share as much positivity as possible, who’s with me? ✨ . . . #eatcaptureshare #seekthesimplicity #mompreneur #foodblogger #communityovercompetition Image taken by @joasis_photography
user_18;user_1856.jpg;How are you? 🙏🏽 . . . It’s been one hell of a week, hasn’t it?!? 😅 @lauren.caris and I have put our artificial light workshop on hold, I’ve postponed next week’s 1-2-1 workshops and am currently not setting any new workshop dates either✨. I love to teach, but I love the idea of everyone staying safe even more 💪🏽! . . . I’m not a panic prone kind of person, but I understand that these are nerve-wrecking and uncertain times, especially for those caring for elderly parents, asthmatic children etc.. I’d love to do whatever I can to make life a little better for YOU, especially for those of you in quarantine and those of you struggling with anxiety 🙏🏽. . . . Ideas currently floating in my mind: A 1-week #eatcaptureshare challenge focusing on cooking with cupboard staples, a special EAT CAPTURE SHARE podcast episode where I interview creative community members on what you’re doing to keep morale up or a blog post about immune boasting nutrition (I am a qualified nutritional therapist after all 😅). Anything here hit the spot? . . . Please let me know how you’re done and how I can help 🙏🏽. . . #vegan #communityovercompetition #whatveganseat #foodphotography #foodstyling #lifeandthyme #vegan #veganuk #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #creativityfound #bestofvegan #eattherainbow #feedfeedvegan #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #flatlayforever #whatveganseat #hautecuisines #foodandwine #poweredbyplants #feedfeed #plantbased #gatheringslikethese #lovetrumpshate #gloobyfood

user_18;user_1859.jpg;Yesterday I took my son ice skating for the very first time in his life❄️. He could barely contain himself, he was SO excited!💓 . . . Over the course of two hours I watched him fall, gosh, it must have been around 50 times! If not more! But every time he stood up, dusted himself off and continued, with a big smile on his face 😁. . . . At the end of the evening with his trousers soaking wet from the icy tumbles, he was swinging between complete exhaustion and utter bliss, stating that it had been the best thing he’d ever done 💪🏽. . . . As I move between working more for clients than I’ve ever worked before (see bts on stories) 📸 and preparing to meet with @thebrand_stylist tomorrow to plan the layout of my #foodphotography book, I feel like my son: TOTALLY exhausted but SO SO SO excited cuz this project is hands down one of the best things I’ve EVER done. 🙏🏽 #calledtobecreative . . . . #foodstyling #creativityfound #whatveganseat #foodandwine #flatlayforever #eatyourgreens #bestofvegan #vegan #veganuk #poweredbyplants #mindbodygreen #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #letscookvegan #plantbased #feedfeedvegan #gatheringslikethese #lovetrumpshate #bbcgoodfood #easyvegan #wfpb #foodandwine #bombesquad
user_18;user_1860.jpg;Sometimes someone else gets what you’ve dreamed of for so long - the 10K followers on IG, the prestigious award, the thriving photography business, the book deal. . . . The question is what do you do when your dreams aren’t quite within reach yet? When it’s just not coming together the way you hoped for?🤔 . . . Do you cry like a puppy dog🐶, throw in the towel and decide that it wasn’t to be OR do you cry like a puppy dog (LOADS), feel super sorry for yourself, then dust yourself off, pick yourself up and work even harder as you aim for your goals? 💪🏽 . . . I wholeheartedly believe that a hint of tenacity and a s**tload of hard work go a long way. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, that doesn’t mean it’s fair or that everything will be ok, but it does mean you’ll never have to wonder ‘what if’. It also means that when you get to where you wanna go, it will all have been worth it. 😘 . . . IMAGE INFO: I had a lovely 1-2-1 student, Nas join me in the studio today and it was wonderful seeing her work through her styling struggles and doubts and uncertainties. Adored how she kept a close eye on her destination allowing her to arrive exactly where she wanted to ✨. We jointly created this scene trying to capture a hint of Spring. Then we ate it all 🙈! . . . P.S. If you’d love to study #foodphotography and #foodstyling with me and chat about achieving your goals, I’m hosting a 2-day workshop in London with the fabulous @lauren.caris April 18th and 19th.

user_18;user_1865.jpg;#ad Cooking from scratch is pure love 💕 💕💕, wouldn’t you agree? . . . I have teamed up with @epica.uk again to bring you a deliciously #vegan pasta dough recipe that’s perfect for Valentine’s Day (or any day for that matter😘). Whether you’re cooking for the people you love or simply treating yourself, I can’t think of a better recipe to celebrate all the things we ❤️. . . . Apart from being egg-free and completely vegan, what makes this pasta recipe extra special is the addition of @epica.uk ‘s super delicious red pepper tapenade, giving the pasta dough a beautiful colour and incredible depth of flavour. @epica.uk ‘s red pepper tapenade is so versatile it also serves as the perfect pasta sauce to complete this pasta dish in no time. 💪🏽 . . . . Moreover, @epica.uk red pepper tapenade tastes incredible, which is why it‘s won the prestigious GREAT TASTE AWARD. I adore the fact that @epica.uk makes #plantbased eating accessible and easy for everyone to enjoy, whilst still keeping their commitment to high quality ingredients. #TLPandEpica . . . You can find @epica.uk in the refrigeration aisle in Sainsbury and the recipe for this homemade pasta dough recipe on the blog right now!

user_18;user_1866.jpg;"I love going back to my ‘roots’, the very reason I started The Little Plantation in the first place ✨. . . .

user_18;user_1867.jpg;I finished writing my book and handed in my manuscript yesterday 😭😭😭😭😭😭💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽. . . . It’s the book I started writing in January 2019, the #foodphotography book I’m writing for YOU, the one I’ve been talking about for SO long, the one that got rejected a 1000 times. 💕 . . . I bumped into fellow creative, local friend, the lovely @bexseal this morning (she’s an INCREDIBLE food writer, please check her out) and we started chatting about how writing a book is kinda like a VERY long labour 🙈. Honestly ☺️. . . . Thing is, I’m still far from done. My fab structural editor @andthrive will come back with LOTS of suggested changes I’m sure 😅 before the manuscript is off again on Friday to the super sweet line editor @taraosullivan1 who’ll check for typos and such ☺️. . . . But today as I go into a meeting to discuss the book cover and design💃🏽, I can’t help but smile. Almost, almost there. P.S. Want to help choose the cover?

user_18;user_1869.jpg;Where do you find inspiration? ✨🌱 . . . In this busy world of endless internet scrolling, how can you stay focused and inspired to create the food images you really want and feel uniquely yours✨? How can you keep the creative juices flowing without letting the well run dry? 🤓🤔 . . . It’s a question I get asked all the time, but as a teacher it is not my job to show you what the ‘answer’ is, instead it’s my obligation to empower you to find the answers all for yourself 😘. . . . With that in mind I invited participants of the #eatcaptureshare challenge to study masterful artists’ work all this week, with today’s focus being Vermeer. His understanding and play with light and shadow is legendary and the fountain of endless inspiration for so many visual artists💪🏽. Have you taken inspiration from his work? ✨✨ . . . IMAGE INFO: Together with my super lovely 1-2-1 #foodphotography and #foodstyling student @lizamlf I created and took this image, inspired by his work, a few weeks ago. 🖤🖤🖤I used the TLP dark green wood preset for Lightroom to pull the look together, and hope you like it.

user_18;user_1870.jpg;Bored of seeing the same food photos on instagram? 🤔. . . White marble, dark wood or - wait for it - neutral coloured vinyl. If you look around the @instagram #foodphotography scene you’d think that’s all that’s ‘allowed’. Rules exist only to be broken, I say 😜. At least in my #foodstyling books 😆! . . . And with that motto in mind, today for the #eatcaptureshare challenge, we draw inspiration from one of the Masters, Joan Miró, who played boldly with primary colours and black lines. He was endlessly influenced by nature, his art was/is playful and full of imagination. I felt this challenge would empower everyone to truly explore colour theory in all its forms and judging by the entries so far I think I may have been on to something 💁🏽‍♀️💛💙❤️. . . . It has been SO moving to see today’s submissions flood in. Incredible EVERYONE - thank you for letting your creativity run riot 😭. My husband got so excited after seeing all your images he even submitted an entry - he couldn’t help himself - and my son wants to submit an entry too via my @eatcaptureshare_ ig stories so watch this space💓. . . . The challenge opened up an interesting discussion here at home with my feisty 9-year-old saying he can’t wait to see what everyone does for theme 9, Frida Kahlo. He’s hoping monkeys on shoulders will be involved 😆. . . . Thank you again everyone for making the start of week three so spectacular. Very touched 🙏🏽. . . . P.S. Not sure what I’m talking about, check the recent #ecsw20 entries 💙💛❤️. . . .

Not only is there a delicious brand NEW #vegan winter warming recipe of roasted cauliflower salad on the blog (SO good!😋😋😋), but I can also FINALLY reveal that I have teamed with @epica.uk 💓 for the first half of 2020 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽. Over the coming months I’ll be creating seasonal #plantbased recipes using their insanely delicious vegan red pepper tapenade and sharing it with you on the blog. 🥰 . . . It’s an honour to be teaming up with a beautiful brand on a longer term basis especially because I LOVE that they’ve created a vegan product that’s accessible to all and current available at Sainsbury’s!😋😋😋 . . . @epica.uk red pepper tapenade is packed full of flavour, versatile and easy to use giving skeptic carnivores the chance to try a vegan product that’s delicious, high quality yet anything but intimidating 😋😋😋. It’s in line with why I started The Little Plantation all those years ago, to show that eating vegan once a day, twice a week or all the time IS possible 🙏🏽. #TLPandEpica . . .

Moreover I’m sharing the insanely delicious recipe right here on instagram! . . . @tateandlylesugars ’s Agave Plant Syrup is a vegan alternative to honey and so versatile- it can be used for baking or breakfast recipes just like the one I’m sharing today. You can find the HOW TO recipe process outlined in my stories today. Will you stop by there and say hi? 🥰💓#tateandlylesugars . . . Vegan bacon avocado toast recipe . INGREDIENTS: 65g coconut flakes 1tbs tamari or soya sauce 2tsp liquid smoke 2tbs Tate and Lyle's agave syrup 1/4 tsp smoked paprika 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp olive oil Pinch of coarsely round pepper (optional) . TO SERVE toasted and sliced sourdough bread  ripe avocado (1/2 an avocado per slice of bread) salt and pepper to taste (optional) salad cress (optional)  a drizzle of olive oil to taste (optional)  Instructions: pre-heat the oven to 150C.  Mix the coconut flakes, tamari sauce, liquid smoke, Tate and Lyle's agave syrup, smoked paprika, salt, olive oil and pepper in a bowl until evenly combined. Spread out evenly on a non-stick baking paper and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Check in every 5 minutes as every oven is different and you don't want the bacon to go too toasty ;). Whilst the vegan bacon is in the oven, toast you bread and open, de-stone, peel and slice the avocado.Assemble the toast to your liking.  NOTE! There should be enough bacon for about 8 slices of toast! If you're flying solo or only have a few mouths to feed, store the left over bacon in an airtight container and use within 3 days. ."

CREATIVITY - Will feature heavily in this season’s #eatcaptureshare food photography challenge 🎉🎉🎉 with some new themes (SOOOOO excited to share them) and a brand new format for the LIVE announcement of the winners. You can register via the link in my bio or stories.🥳✨ . . . CREATIVITY - After years of teaching food photography and styling, it’s time I teach food photography in a way I have NEVER taught before and offer a brand new workshop format ✨. BURSTING to tell you more about it. I am also in the middle of planning a brand new workshop abroad ✈️. More soon...🤫 . . . CREATIVITY - Will be the driving force behind the content I’ll share on my instagram grid in 2020. I don’t want to play it safe or follow a formula I know works😊 cuz I’ll show up better for YOU if I’m more experimental and creative☺️. No worries, still lots of flatlays and focus on simple everyday #vegan food, but with more room to evolve. . . CREATIVITY - actually forms a HUGE part of my food photography book due out this year!!!! Much more than I’d intended initially. It’s meant things have had to be ditched or re-written, but man, does it feel right! . . . IMAGE INFO: Shot last month when the incredibly talented creative & photographer @violaminerva stopped by for lunch. This is our actual real #plantbased meal, nothing cooked specifically for IG. Though we did let our CREATIVITY roam freely in the styling 🙈. As though she knew how meticulously I plan EVERYTHING, Viola kindly gifted me her 2020 diary🥰. @violaminerva designed it and it’s STUNNING. You can get your copy on her blog. I couldn’t help photograph Viola. Isn’t she gorgeous and so magnetic? . . . . . #user_18 #creativityfound #lovetrumpshate #veganuk
user_18;user_1891.jpg;STRUCTURE - That was my word for 2019! 🙈 . . . I wanted to be more intentional in how I STRUCTURE my day to avoid that mindless scroll. I wanted to STRUCTURE my life so that I could built in time to focus on my goals, including write my 📸book, looking after my health (which was at an all time low 🥺at the start of 2019) and spending time with family and friends whilst being wholeheartedly present.💓 . . . As we approach the end of 2019 I can honestly say that the word served me SO well! 💓💓💓 Time to look after my body and fitness is built into the structure of my day and is none negotiable! And after a rocky first half of 2019 🤒😴🤧I can now clearly see how building health into the STRUCTURE of my day has been what’s made EVERYTHING else possible. 💪🏽 . . . This has meant that I’ve been stronger physically and mentally and able to show up with more energy and joy for my #eatcaptureshare podcast listers as well as my food photography students this season 💓 and hopefully been a better mama, wife and friend too🤞🏽. . . . STRUCTURE in my day has allowed me to create more content than ever before for #foodphotography clients in 2019 with focus and attention to detail. This has felt so grounding and empowering 🙏🏽. . . . I feel it’s SO cool 😎 that I’m seeing out the year working intensely with my STRUCTURAL editor on the #foodstyling and #foodphotography book, the one I’ve been writing for YOU for 12 months now ☺️🙈!!! With the best STRUCTURAL editor on my A-team (@andthrive I’m looking at you!) I now have a set deadline which is LITERALLY around the corner 🏃🏽‍♀️😅 and I cannot wait to hand over the manuscript to the line editor. So bring on 2020! I’m ready for ya! . . . Did you have a word for 2019? If so will you share it with me? ✨💓✨ . . . . IMAGE INFO: 📸 by @joasis_photography 😘.

user_18;user_1895.jpg;#AD Who else has started their Christmas baking a tad early 🙋🏽‍♀️🙊? . . . Sorry, I can't help it, I LOVE Christmas 🎄and as baking forms such a huge part of our Christmas tradition, I'm super excited to be bringing you the recipe for these easy and mega fluffy vegan gingerbread muffins with vegan 'melted snow' cream cheese frosting.⛄️ . . . I made the recipe for day 7 of @BrevilleUK’s #12bakesofChristmas by using my brand new Breville HeatSoft™ hand mixer, which allowed me to save time in the kitchen and create these muffins in 30 minutes flat without any major planning ahead! How? Breville's HeatSoft™technology means you can bring ingredients like vegan butter and almond milk straight from the fridge without needing it to reach room temperature. So cool and just what I need as a busy mama! . . . I shared some more details about the Breville HeatSoft™hand mixer over on stories today where you can also find the link to my thorough blog review of the mixer. In the interim, I'll leave you with the vegan gingerbread muffin recipe below in the comment section.

user_18;user_18101.jpg;Do we really HAVE to document everything on instagram? 🤔 . . . I so WANT to share every creative move, but I notice that when I pick up the phone to share a BTS story of a shoot, I’m removing myself from the depth of the creative process and as I’m in this weird phase of rebelling against all things digital I don’t wanna 🤪. . . . Then I think - gosh that’s so pretentious and prima donna-like, just get over yourself woman! But then the moment’s passed and sharing it feels like I’m playing catch up. Ughhh so complicated 🤯. #firstworldproblems . . . . Can we create, inspire and bring our community of fellow food photographers joy without being tied to our phone 24/7? Are we still successfully content creators in this digital age even if our IG feeds are inactive and we don’t show and share our work?🤷🏽‍♀️ . . . Current mood.

When I look around I don’t see very many people of colour or women who look and sound like me doing what I do, though I know they are out there ✨✨✨. . . .

Quietly, calmly without fanfare or big announcements, but instead with a sh*tload of determination and strong work ethic.🔥 . . .

user_18;user_18107.jpg;This is a shot I took at the very first group food photography workshop I EVER taught. . . . And though I have met a lot of students over the years and all are dear to me, some leave a particularly profound impression. @nutritious.living Caroline 🥰is one of those people who I was especially fond of from the start💓. . . . . Despite meeting what now feels like years ago, we stayed in touch. She helped me find a web designer to transfer my food blog into the thriving creative business hub it is today and I gave her advice about embarking on the journey of qualifying as a nutritional therapist, seeing that I completed the course she was eager to sign up to. . . . No one deserves a terminal cancer diagnosis, but it feels extra sh*tty if it happens to someone as cool, heart felt, giving, friendly, beautiful and schermazing as Caroline. . . .

user_18;user_18114.jpg;Subtle or bold? What type of #foodstyling do you prefer? 🤔 . . . Today I had the rather lovely @sarah_neuner_food_photography in the studio allowing me to teach her all I know about #foodphotography. 🙏🏽 Sarah took the lead, styling this shot and I helped her tweak it into the understated, soft, subtle look she was eager to create. ✨✨✨ . . . I used some of the food styling techniques I outline in depth in the food photography book I’m writing for YOU, so that - no matter where you are in the world 🌍 - you can learn all the tips and tricks I know from 5 years + behind the camera.💪🏽📸 . . . . . Teaching Sarah the methods from my book was an utter joy and reaffirmed to me that I just need to work a little bit harder to get the book into YOUR hands asap 🏃🏽‍♀️😅😘. . . .

I wanted to re-brand both The Little Plantation blog and the Eat Capture Share podcast (and book!) and tie them together as they form an intricate part of me, my business and my work. . . . In order to make it happen I looked at the foods I ALWAYS seem to turn to when in season, checked out the foods that ALWAYS feature on my IG feed (figs, kale, watercress, pomegranate, apples and beets in case you were wondering) and asked @scriptandvine to create a brand look that felt feminine, bold, elegant, organic and heartfelt 💓💓💓💓. . . .

user_18;user_18122.jpg;DOES THE PERSON BEHIND THE GRID MATTER? 🤔 . . . I mean yes of course they do, but do their likes, captions, personality traits, eating habits and views of the world REALLY impact whether you follow them or not? Honestly?🤓 . . . I strongly believe that the human beings behind the pretty pictures will matter more and more to us social media users as we continue to be inundated with content and struggle to decide if and when to press the FOLLOW button✨✨✨✨. In other words, having people feel a connection to the person behind the grid AKA YOU is essential if impact and audience growth is what you’re after💪🏽. . . . I REALLY dislike having my picture taken, Youtube is a TOTAL no go and sharing too much about my personal life on instagram feels kinda 🥴🙈, yet I also wanted to ensure the food photography tips, ideas and inspiration I want to share with my audience wasn’t going to get lost just cuz I get all nervous when someone sticks a camera in my face ☺️. . . . That’s how the idea of the #eatcaptureshare podcast was born - a place where I can be authentically me whilst talking about all the things YOU care about - food, photography, creativity, the works. 💓💓💓 . . . On that note, season 3 of the podcast airs Monday 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽and I am sooooo excited to share the new episodes with you all #communityovercompetition #2moredays #calledtobecreative . . . . .

user_18;user_18123.jpg;Do you feel self conscious about how you write instagram captions? (Or how others perceive you and your captions)☺️? . . . I did initially FOR SURE, but being worried about how I came across depleted me of SO much energy, I thought it best to just be 100% myself and get on with it 😆😅. . . . Oddly, once I said exactly how I felt and spoke openly about what was in my heart, I enjoyed instagram much more and gained way more traction too. 🥰🥰🥰 . . . . Consequently, when I started the #eatcaptureshare podcast I decided from the outset to be wholeheartedly me, no scripts or set agendas🙃. I say what I feel and edit as little as I can. It means that at times the podcast is quite raw and vulnerable and other times it’s all a bit silly 🤪🙈. . . . Season 3 launches on Monday💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽.

user_18;user_18125.jpg;Do you feel like no one actually really notices you or your work on instagram? 😔 . . . . When I started on instagram, I felt like no one saw how hard I tried and how much energy I poured into my recipes and my photography 😭. Consequently I swore that once I had a platform - no matter how big or small - I’d do my utmost to make the people in my audience feel seen and heard and like they mattered (because you do!). ✨✨✨ . . . Some of you never comment on my images or send me DMs ☺️others are super vocal and chatty🥰, either way I am grateful for you all and I try my best to provide content that I hope will bring you joy and give you a sense that you matter to me. . . . All this played a huge role in my decision to choose ’I SEE YOU’ by @sumeramusic as my theme song for the #eatcaptureshare podcast - the song is 100% dedicated to you 💓.

I don’t usually share the 🥴 🤦🏽‍♀️😕shots but thought I would today, in case you think everyone else on instagram nails all their shots INSTANTLY except of course you 😘.

So I decided to follow my heart, leave my 9-5 and dedicate every waking hour to #foodphotography ✨✨✨. . . . ⭐️It’s also why I’m teaching here LIVE tomorrow at 7pm BST to answer any questions you might have in the best way I can 🙏🏼. Thing is, I’d love to help you get unstuck and give you the confidence to take your food photos to the place I know you can take them💪🏼💓💓💓. Will I see you there? 🤞🏼 . . . . ⭐️Though I’ve been teaching LIVE classes for more than 2 years now I still feel physically sick 🥴two seconds before I go LIVE. Mainly cuz technology is SO unpredictable which makes me mega nervous😅, but knowing the LIVE tutorials bring you joy makes them fun in a weird kinda way.🥳 . . . .

IGs black and white filter did the rest, no further tinkering needed. . . . I thought long and hard about posting this image cuz☺️, well it feels self indulgent and - being black and white- such a break from my ‘normal’ feed😅. But, I don’t want to overthink my IG feed too much and need to stop hiding behind the camera especially as one of the few brown women occupying the food photography space👩🏽.

user_18;user_18135.jpg;Food photography workshops are a waste of money! Surely it’s not worth it! 🧐 . . . It’s true that most #foodstyling workshops and courses are an investment, 🤓 BUT MY life changes MASSIVELY when I invested in myself and my learning - much quicker than had I not - which is why I feel so passionate about teaching YOU all I know. ✨🙏🏼✨ . . . Attending workshops gave me the confidence to make #foodphotography my full-time gig and the know-how to take on paying clients.💪🏼 . . . I now employ two lovely people part-time to help me do what I do and feel so fortunate that many past students have made huge leaps towards their goals in the same way I have. . . . . Therefore today on stories I am sharing how two former food photography students of mine are making it happen for themselves in the world of food and photography ✨✨✨✨. . . .

user_18;user_18136.jpg;Epic fail 👎🏼 or epic win👍🏼? 🤔 . . . The line between the two can be SO thin. Here’s what I mean... . . . ⭐️Playing it safe, doing what I know and what resonates with my lovely audience 💓can feel like a win. 🥇 . ⭐️Those instagram likes are SOOOOO desirable🥰, yet following a ‘formula’, even if it brings me ig hearts can feel like I’m losing too - I loose my sense of adventure, playfulness, experimentation and creative growth. 🥺 . . . ⭐️Doing something outside my comfort zone is scary 😅and if the shot doesn’t come out 100% the way I want it to, it feels like a fail😫. . ⭐️Yet on the other side of that is learning, problem solving and permission to try more new things.✨💪🏼✨ . . . ⭐️All of this to say I don’t know if I love or hate this shot🤔. Fried food is something I’ve always been afraid to photograph 😅- though I SO enjoyed eating these fried zucchini fritters/ bhajis trust you me😋- and shooting on THAT backdrop was hard, but I LOVE that I pushed the boat out and that I’m stretching myself. So there you have it #eatcaptureshare. ☺️ . . . . IMAGE INFO: ⭐️Recipe from @healthy_ish red lentil zucchini fritters. Actual lunch we eat this weekend gone. ⭐️Used my preset for Lightroom TLP dark green wood. ⭐️All the plates are there cuz I tried so many different styling options, till I settled on the oval platter.

user_18;user_18143.jpg;THIS IS MASSIVE!!! 🥳🥳🥳 . . . . Actually it IS, but not in the way you might think 🙊. All I wanna say is THANK YOU for supporting me and The Little Plantation by being here, pressing heart ❤️, commenting, sharing my images, podcast and ig photography challenge. 🙏🏼 . . . I feel sometimes I’m so freakin’ caught up in launching my courses, announcing a new podcast episode or sharing some food styling tip that I can’t even make space to say those two important words.☺️ . . . Thing is without YOU taking an interest in my simple everyday #plantbased food and #foodphotography none of this would ever have been. As I was answering the WHAT DO YOU DO FOR WORK? question after yoga today, it just dawned on me 🥰. Dang, so grateful 😘✨✨✨ . . . So yeah thank you so much 🙏🏼.

user_18;user_18146.jpg;ARE YOU TEAM LIGHT & BRIGHT or DARK & MOODY?🌚🌞 . . . Often students come to me and say they don’t know which direction to go 🤪. Have you faced this stylistic dilemma too? 😅 . . . If you feel a REALLY strong calling for one over the other, I’d say, follow your heart and go for it 💓💪🏼. But I also believe you don’t HAVE to choose, you can do both! (And often if you’re at the start of your food photography journey it’s good to explore, experiment and not box yourself in 😘✨✨✨). . . . Will having dark AND light shots in your feed mess up the ‘consistency’ of your grid? 🧐 . . . NO! 😜It’s my view that through good and consistent EDITING you can pull LOTS of different styles together and still create a cohesive IG feed 🥳🥳🥳🥳. . . . It’s why I’ll be sharing lots of FREE editing, #foodstyling and food photography tips during my Autumn food photography challenge. Doors close TOMORROW and won’t re-open until 2020 so you better be quick! 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏿‍♀️#eatcaptureshare . . . . You can find a super quick and ease swipe up option in my stories, bio and IG highlight called IG challenge taking to straight to my blog for LOTS more information.

user_18;user_18149.jpg;CAN YOU COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE ...🤔🤓: . . . A great cookbook has/is/contains...💓🤓😋🤔 . . . I just returned from a camping trip to find an advanced copy of WHOLEFOOD COOKING EVERYDAY by @amychaplin on my doorstep 💃🏽and despite only having a few staple ingredients in the house I could STILL create this delicious, nourishing, seasonal, #plantbased meal of summer tomato and basil pasta with an easy pine nut sauce from the SAUCES section of the book. 🥳🥳🥳. . . Only took 10 minutes, flat 💪🏼..What’s more I got to take a quick snap as it was served - no #foodstyling required - before it all disappeared into our tummies 🙈📸😋. . . . . For me a great cookbook offers simple, delicious, healthy, plant forward, seasonal and quick recipes that are forgiving, adventurous and adjustable to what I’ve got in the house, season by season. . . . Stunning photography helps too 😘. And you’ll be glad to hear that THIS book ticks alllll the boxes. I’ll be sure to share some glimpses on stories if you’re curious 😘. . . .

user_18;user_18155.jpg;Do you know about the 80/20 instagram ’rule’?🧐🙈🤷🏽‍♀️ . . . I try and post 80% what I think you’ll love 💗 and 20% what gets me excited and stops me getting bored of my own photos☺️. . . . Thing is, I aim 🤞🏼to provide valuable content that ensures you get what you came for 😘, whilst also pushing myself creatively, experimenting, avoiding getting stuck in a rut and finding new ways of making better content.✨✨✨ #creativityfound . . . At the moment I’m being most experimental on stories, but I really want to be more playful on the grid too. To be honest I’ve always been a bit more cautious here 🙈but if I just do what’s always ‘worked’ on IG, how can I evolve and provide you with more, better and prettier content 🙃? . . . I’m away from my London studio( if you wanna know where in the world I am just head over to stories 😘), so won’t be posting so much on the grid, BUT when I do I’ll try and post more videos💪🏼. . . .

user_18;user_18160.jpg;What EMOJI best describes this BACKDROP? #worldemojiday . Perhaps 🤪, this 🌈 or what do you think? . . I couldn’t sleep last night, thinking about wild,crazy, outrageous patterns! 🙈 Right, outing myself as the food photography nerd that I am, but it’s true! 🤓 . . . When I feel creatively stuck, it’s like I can’t breathe 🌬until a new idea takes hold. It sounds extreme but I can’t explain it any other way. Does that make sense?☺️ . . . That idea then becomes an obsession until I breathe life into it. Like this shot, with crazy patterns. I saw it alllll night in a dream, so I googled FABRICS LONDON, went to Soho today after yoga and voila 🎩. Only problem, I want more patterned fabrics now 😆! . . . .

user_18;user_18161.jpg;Has your #foodphotography taste changed though instagram ? 🙋🏽‍♀️ . . . Mine has SO much! I used to LOVE that ‘dreamy’ look and often shot at F1.8 when I first started blogging 🙈. But now images like this one (shot at F3.2) just don’t seem like ‘me’ anymore at all. (I tend to shoot waaayyy higher)☺️. . . . I mean think about it, the idea of using harsh light in #foodstyling was unheard of just a few years back and now we’re all loving it (me included 🥰😅) thanks to the trend taking hold right here on this platform. . . . And artificial light 📸was looked down upon and considered ‘wrong’, whereas now it’s all the rage and all over my IG feed!!!☀️☀️☀️ . . . @instagram has shaped my view of food photography so much over the years (hello flatlay 😘), more than even traditional food magazines. And I love this platform for that - the inspiration, the democratisation of food art, the trend setting, the lot. . . So even though all the algorithm stuff can drive me crazy sometimes 🤪 I don’t want to forget how instagram has allowed me to do what I love, to keep evolving creatively and to continue to inspired. Just wanted to share that today 💚😘💚. . . . How has this platform influenced your creativity? . . . . . . . #poweredbyplants #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #vegan #vegansofig #creativityfound #vegansofinstagram #eattherainbow #communityfirst #communityovercompetition #whatveganseat #thatsdarling #kinfolktable #lovetrumpshate #user_18 #foodandwine #wherewomencreate #healthyliving #f52grams #bestofvegan #theartofslowliving #hautecuisines #plantbased
user_18;user_18162.jpg;1, 2 or 3? Which one do you prefer?🤓 . . . I love how different backdrops and different colours impact our food images, don’t you? I also think it’s very telling what our colour preferences say about us 😘. In fact I always invite my food photography students to note down how images make them feel to help them determine what colour combinations they are most drawn too and to help them identify their styling preferences 💓💓💓💓. . . . I intend to complete my COLOUR THEORY chapter of the book I’m writing on #foodstyling and #foodphotography this week and thought I’d share these shots with you to give you a glimpse of what awaits 🙈. Hope that’s cool with you ☺️. . . . P.S. Recipe adapted from @heidijswanson cucumber salad from her cookbook Near & Far, made and reworked 1000x and still a summer favourite 🤤. . . .

user_18;user_18163.jpg;Are your IG posts tanking? 😭 Are your IG likes down and your IG story views decreasing?🙋🏽‍♀️ . . . There was a MAJOR IG glitch approx. two weeks ago affecting numerous accounts in the UK and Europe. A few weeks earlier the US and Australia was affected too! . . . What did this look like - people were unable to comment, being greeted with an error message saying that their comment was blocked to protect the community 🤷🏽‍♀️🧐🤨. Some people were unable to log in all together🙁, to view or post on stories or even see people’s grid😔. Did this happen to you?🙋🏽‍♀️ . . . The question is, why was this happening? Though I don’t have any insider information 😎, since the glitch IG has rolled out a host of new features - our profiles look different, fonts have changed and there are new IG story functions too. So my guess is, as they were updating the app, wires got crossed, causing the IG glitches so many of us experienced. . . . Thing is, either things aren’t back to normal yet (aka there are still some mini glitches here and there that need to be ironed out🤞🏼) OR the algorithms were changed dramatically too, affecting post and stories’ organic reach😒. Either way, when I asked about this on my stories SO many of you noted a marked decrease in post ❤️s, and many - like me - noted a decrease in IG stories reach and views that went over and beyond anything you’d ever experienced.🤓 . . . I wish I had a solution, but I don’t other than to offer reassurance that you’re not alone 💪🏼😘 and the advice to keep sharing what you love💓💓💓. I promise I’ll do the same even if no one sees my stories 😆🥰🥰🥰🥰. Have you got any tips or advice on managing this sudden downturn? I’d love to hear it ❤️❤️❤️❤️. . . . . . P.S.

user_18;user_18167.jpg;How do you stay inspired and how do you keep pushing forward and counter stagnation as a creative? ✨🤔✨ . . . I know #foodstyling and #foodphotography workshops aren’t the answer to every creative stumbling block, but I do know that a collective energy centring on pushing boundaries and making delicious food look beautiful goes a heck of a long way! 💪🏼It’s for this reason it was such a joy to teach the SUMMER’S BOUNTY workshop with @silvia_salvialimone last month. . . . . Not only did I have an incredible co-teacher, but I also got to hang out with a lovely group of food lovers from places near and far. Thank you @ethivegan , Dovile, @emmottelainea and @thetinyitalian for allowing us to teach you all we know 🙏🏼. . . . . This workshop could not have happened without our cool, ground-breaking, generous and awesome partners @aysehabibekucuk @jarrkombucha @nomliving @fivedotbotanics @golden_balls_goodness @the_tribe_way . Thank you for working with us. We are so grateful that you have allowed our brands to align with yours and put a huge smile on our attendees’ faces 🙏🏼. . . . P.S.

user_18;user_18169.jpg;Show us your editing process! 😅 . . . I don’t find editing all that exciting to be honest 🙈 and I’m ALWAYS worried you’ll get bored of yet another BTS of me editing. BUT apparently, according to well.... YOU, it doesn’t get old, which is why I’m sharing a bit of my Lightroom editing process on stories today.😘 . . . I used a shot from the workshop I just taught alongside @silvia_salvialimone to share my editing process, with all the final edits going live on the blog this coming Monday! Can’t wait to show you what we made💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 . . . In the interim I leave you with this shot here as a sneak peek, a shot I took as we were setting up in the garden and an action shot which didn’t quite make the cut☺️. The final shot you’ll see when you swipe left was taken by our student @emmottelainea. Isn’t it awesome? So proud, my heart is full 💓💓💓💓. . . . .

user_18;user_18170.jpg;I don’t have an agent or publisher but I’m still writing my book and sharing the process with YOU💓. . . . It’s by far one of the most vulnerable things I have EVER done 😅because the truth is I could fall flat on my face and not get chosen😭. Worst still there would be no place for me to hide the failure and disappointment from you🙈. . . . So why the hell am I doing this?!? In part I’m selfish and want to share my journey with you so that you continue to hold me accountable🙈. You knowing about the book before it’s even written keeps me on my toes and ensures I don’t stop until I hold the book in my hands ☺️. . . . But I’m also sharing the BTS FOR YOU. Because this book is for YOU. It’s all the things you ask me about #foodstyling, #foodphotography, editing, colour theory, the works. How can you NOT be a part of the process ✨? . . . I’m sharing every difficult step along the way because I want to dispel the myth that creating something that matters is easy or linear, that it’s not cast in self doubt, fear and - let’s be honest - moments of chaos and madness! 🤪 . . . I’m sharing all the stumbling blocks so YOU take your own difficult steps to completing the creative work that YOU were meant to bring into the world. . . . That’s whys I’m sharing the process, the ups and downs, the whole 9 yards. . . . . Now all I need is the courage to actually send my second proposal out into the world 📤. One email at a time 😬. Wish me luck #starttodayjournal #creativityfound #calledtobecreative . . . . . . P.S.

user_18;user_18171.jpg;How much ‘should’ we share on instagram? How much of ourselves should be visible on our grid? 💁🏽‍♀️When’s it too much? And does it actually matter?🤔 . . . I think about this kinda stuff A LOT, in part because instagram plays such a pivotal role in my creative business as well as that of my students. (I often think about what makes ‘business sense’ and what should I consequently advise my students to do). . . . In part because instagram acts a lot like a mirror, reflecting back trends and the current zeitgeist. (What is the accepted cultural approach TODAY versus your own personal feel-good zone when it comes to sharing). . . . There’s no doubt in my mind that sharing our vulnerabilities is more acceptable than EVER before, which I LOVE 💕. We’re also living during a time where private and personal boundaries are more blurred, where we’re sharing more details of our lives than EVER before, which in turn I’m less comfortable with I must confess😅. . . . And it’s here that I get stuck 🙈- I value privacy SO much, yet sharing more facets of one’s life undoubtedly builds connection to one’s audience, personal brand and the relatability factor. Not sharing enough could be seen as a business ‘mistake’ in the current social media dominated climate, which makes me feel a little anxious. Yet sharing more personal facets of one’s life even if it doesn’t feel ‘right’ can be counterproductive and - dare I say it - completely inauthentic too. . . . Is this conflict something you struggle with? I’m currently in a real phase of overthinking the whole ‘personal brand’ thing🤪. I’d love your thoughts on the matter. ☺️ . . . . . . #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #user_18 #lovetrumpshate #whatveganseat #bestofvegan #vegan #veganuk #veganbreakfast #healthyliving #healthylifestyle #thatsdarling #darlingweekend #flatlayforever #hautecuisines #foodphotography #foodstyling #mycreativebiz #calledtobecreative #creativityfound #onthetableproject #eattherainbow #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram
user_18;user_18172.jpg;Instagram is the visual artists’ quarters of the 21st century! 👩🏽‍🎨 . . . A place where we share our work, get inspired and more importantly inspire others ✨✨✨. We network, lift each other up and occasionally despair 🤪 cuz DANG so and so’s work is smokin’ hot 🔥at the mo and so and so is growing an audience like no one’s business 😆! . . . Much as I love this online community of makers and out-of-the-box thinkers, I do also love meeting irl, taking virtual connections to a deeper level and immersing myself wholeheartedly in the creative process. . . . It’s why I’m opening my home and studio up to a small group of creatives this weekend 💓💓💓💓💓. . . . Together with @silvia_salvialimone I’ll be teaching my little heart out, sharing all I know with food lovers and photography students from across Europe 💕💕💕. . . . Preparations are in full swing and I aim to show as much as I can on stories today throughout to Sunday. Would love to see you there 😘. . . . . . . P.S.

user_18;user_18180.jpg;"Why are we so obsessed about instagram? 🤔 . . . Sure there’s the idea that we can become the next viral instagram sensation, make lots of money and live happily ever after. For those looking for a quick fix that may indeed be the pull😆. . . . . But I think there are other, more powerful and interesting forces at play. For one it’s a platform that celebrates creativity, something that was - up until this social media age - deeply undervalued and, dare I say it, suppressed. (As in: I can’t possibly leave my well paid law career to become a floral designer?!?) . . . For two, it nurtures community, a sense of connection and even belonging; you find ‘your’ people much in the same way you (finally) found your people that first day you declared your major in college and looked around to all the other social work students to find they were as obsessed about social justice as you were! 🤓 . . . But finally and perhaps more importantly it’s the chance to be seen for who you are when no one is watching, what you do when no boundaries are put in place and the potential you have when YOU are allowed to express your vision, hopes and dreams in the the way you want to. No rules imposed ⭐️. . . . . So on that note, please know that there is no need to do what someone else is doing 💪🏼. No need to try to blend in or hide behind the safe choice. We want you in all your weird and wonderful uniqueness. ⭐️ Now go, create and share your work. As always excited to see what you come up with. #eatcaptureshare . . . . . P.S. Dedicated to all my schermazing Eat, Capture, Share challenge participants 😘 and past students including super lovely @magdaszmej @magsszmej with whom I created this scene. . . . . . #vegan #veganuk #veganbreakfast #foodphotography #foodstyling #creativityfound #whatveganseat #vegansofibstagram #bestofvegan #poweredbyplants #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #thatsdarling #flatlayforever #feedfeedvegan #eattheworld #gatheringslikethese #morningslikethese #foodandwine #eattheworld #breakfastideas #plantbased #user_18 #livetrumpshate #communityovercompetition #communityfirst #calledtobecreative"

user_18;user_18183.jpg;This photo doesn’t quite work for me 😕, but I posted it anyway (NOT to fish for compliments but)🙃... . . . ...cuz I was in a rush 🏃🏽‍♀️and couldn’t put my wrongs right but kinda love the process of trying, failing and learning from it.🙈 . . ...cuz I know where I went wrong and how to put it right next time🤓💪🏼. . . . ...cuz it was what I actually ate (it’s a vegan roasted beet and yoghurt salad) 😋😋😋for lunch today and I want to keep it real here 😎. . . . ... cuz I shot this for my LIGHT & SHADOW chapter of my #foodphotography book proposal just now and kinda like the imperfection of it. . . . ...Cuz I can’t wait to share some ideas behind natural styling and how to save a food image when all seems lost at the #foodstyling workshop and with my online students this month and am wondering whether to address natural styling principles in this Sunday’s LIVE mini food photography tutorial here on IG as well. Would that be of interest 🙈? . . . P.S. My ❤️ button works again 😅. Just took 24 hours (see yesterday’s post). . . . . #poweredbyplants #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #vegan #veganuk #bbcgoodfood #user_18 #lovetrumpshate #creativityfound #wabisabi #postitfortheaesthetic #feedfeed #whatveganseat #bestofvegan #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #plantbased #eattherainbow #eattheworld #bombesquad #flatlayforever #kinfolktable #bbcgoodfood #f52grams #healthylifestyle #letscookvegan
user_18;user_18184.jpg;What does it take to ‘succeed’ on instagram now? 🤔 . . . The truth is the platform is SO different to what it was even 2 years ago 😳. But today’s #eatcaptureshare podcast guest @silvia_salvialimone has some clear and tangible ideas on what it REALLY takes to make your mark on the foodie instagram scene at this very moment✨💪🏼⭐️. . . . Mega talented food photography, stylist and vegan baker Silvia also shares her thoughts on THE current food trends and on how to find inspiration beyond the grid 💓.

user_18;user_18186.jpg;Too many food accounts on instagram are looking the same? 😳Agree or disagree 🤔? . . . I am fascinated by our quest to be unique and by our desire to develop our own style. How can we actually achieve that✨? 💡 . I’m fascinated too by creative inspiration - where can we access it outside this platform? 🤓 . I’m fascinated by the creative urge to keep pushing forward and take risks that break away from the crowd pleasers (brownies, pies, doughnuts, breakfast bowls, I’m looking at you!) and instead make way for real evolution 💪🏼. . Most of all I am fascinated by the task of teaching all of the above to my students ✨✨✨. THAT’S what it’s about for me, that’s what gets me excited 🙈. . AND I cannot wait to teach alongside my foodie bestie @silvia_salvialimone with whom I shot and styled this image today. 💓 . We’re working hard at putting the final touches to our June 30th London #foodstyling workshop together and today was our brain-storming day to get everything right for our students later this month ⭐️. I am ecstatic that we share the same vision and always push each other creatively. Now waiting to share that energy with you 😘 💓💓💓💓. .

user_18;user_18187.jpg;#ad How do you feel about influencers promoting products on social media? 🤔 . . I feel very strongly that I can only put my name behind a product or concept I love💓, that I would gladly spend my own money on buying even if I wasn't being paid to tell you about it. It's my commitment to you! . . I also know that there are very few products I feel that way about, which is why I keep promoted posts to a minimum here in this space. Hence if you see a product or movement or idea promoted by me, you KNOW I'm super excited about it.💪🏼 . . And indeed I'm super excited about #Carapelli organic #extravirginoliveoil (@carapellifirenze). It tastes incredible and took this seasonal, organic #vegan family evening meal to the next level! . . #Carapelli is one of the world's leading organic extra virgin olive oil companies that focus on promoting #organicoliveoil and want to inspire home cooks like YOU ✨to explore and prepare more organic dinners. It's why they started the #mycarapellicraft movement, to get you excited about crafting gorgeous and delicious organic meals in the comfort of your own home. . . You can see my journey to putting this Spring evening meal together over in stories today, and I so hope it gets you fired up about sourcing organic products in your neighbourhood. Or follow the hashtag #centuriesofmastery for more organic inspired, stunning dinner ideas and visuals. #CarapellisGuideTo #carapellioliveoil #carapelliuk . . . . #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #poweredbyplants #user_18 #f52grams #gatheringslikethese #plantbased #whatveganseat #vegansofig #foodandwine #foodphotography #foodstyling #eattherainbow #veganuk #bestofvegan #eattheworld #vegansofinstagram
user_18;user_18188.jpg;‘You’re not good enough!’ . . . ‘There’s no market for your food photography book.’ . . . ‘No.’ . . . Rejections like these, and especially that last word, NO, have been said to me so many times in the last 5 years of my food blogging and food photography journey that I don’t think I can even keep count.🤓 . . . I can’t pretend as if it doesn’t hurt me when there’re disappointments and setbacks, but I CAN say that they’ve never ever stopped me from staying on course and keeping my eye on my goal.🤩 . . . I say all this because when you see me holding that @blogosphere_magazine Food Influencer of the Year Award (STILL mildly shocked actually 😳) toothy grin and all, you’re seeing a highlight reel, not the messy beginning of my journey or the many rejections that I have experienced along the way. #realtalk . . So if you’re in a BLAH 😔 season of your life and it feels like everyone on social is achieving what your heart 💓 so desperately wants, please know that place where you’re at, we’re all there. We all feel that way on days that kinda suck. . . . But please focus on that fire 🔥 in your belly, that’s the one to nourish cuz it’s the thing that will propel you forward so that YOU hold YOUR trophy when the time is just right💪🏽. . . . P.S. An extra special THANK YOU to my extraordinarily cool #eatcaptureshare community for voting for me, to @lachicabites for being an awesome friend yesterday and to @aliceaudley and @blogosphere_magazine for putting on such an INCREDIBLE event last night.

user_18;user_18189.jpg;When you look at this shot, do you see light or darkness?✨🌑 . . . Out of the 4 shots (of these mini vegan bundt cakes with hibiscus glaze 🤪) shared, which one speaks to you the most, which one makes you smile? ☺️ Perhaps none 😆. The differences are subtle but there (for a better viewpoint check out stories 😘). . . . They were all edited in EXACTLY the same way (though I promise to share an unedited version on stories today), the only difference is how I played with the light. That’s all.✨ . . . My last 1-2-1 food photography student for May, who will be joining me in the studio tomorrow, wants to explore playing with light, and I cannot wait to deep dive into my favourite topic through LOTS of hands on practice with her💪🏽. . . . . Playing with light and shadow will also be one of the chapters in my #foodphotography and #foodstyling book 💓💓💓💓. Just working with @scriptandvine (thank you so much @mariawiggeart for the recommendation) on some design elements for my book proposal and then hoping to sit down with the awesome graphic designer @madebymrmillas for a crash course on indesign to fine tune the proposal. . Then she’ll be sent out into the world to do her thing, get rejected, you know, the works. Feeling nervous/excited as well as hopeful that 1 person will fall in love with her though 💪🏽😅. . . . . Anyone else obsessed with light and shadow or am I the one food photography geek in da house 🙋🏽‍♀️? 🤷🏽‍♀️ . . . . P.S. If you wanna come and talk light and shadow work till the cows come home and fine tune your Lightroom editing feel free to join my ecourse or June 1-day workshop with the incredible @silvia_salvialimone. They are my last two courses before a loonnggg teaching break 💆🏽‍♀️to focus on (finally) finishing the book 📚. . . . . . #vegan #beautifulcuisines #mycommontable #lovetrumpshate #veganbaking #user_18 #eatcaptureshare #chasinglight #veganuk #bestofvegan #vegansofig #whatveganseat #flatlayforever #eattheworld #imsomartha #gatheringslikethese #theartofslowliving #thatsdarling #f52grams #verilymoment #foodandwine #plantbased
user_18;user_18190.jpg;How do food bloggers make money on IG? 🤔 . How do food influencers get brands to work with them?🤓 . How do food bloggers ensure they get paid what they’re worth? 💪🏼 . . How do you generate other sources of income beyond brand collabs? . . . . I don’t have a two step process to answer these questions but I DO have a brand new hour long #eatcaptureshare podcast episode (22) lined up for you 💓where my guest, internet sensation @shivesh17 digs deep to tell you EXACTLY how it’s done ✨✨✨. . . . It’s already one of my most downloaded episodes EVER despite only launching yesterday without any promo (until now) 🤩! Why? Because it’s PACKED full of tangible actionable steps 🔥⭐️💥!

user_18;user_18192.jpg;What propels you to post on instagram even when the algorithms seem to conspire against you? 🤔 . . . What gives you the strength to keep going even when no one notices your picture, when your follower number decline or your engagement isn’t what it used to be? ✨✨✨✨ . . . . In short, what’s your why?⭐️ . . . I’ve got 2 🙈! For one I just love creating💓💓💓💓. I ADORE playing with light and shadow, colours and textures - SO fun! Secondly it might sound conceited but I feel my calling is to bring people together who love food, photography and styling just as much as I do and the occasional instagram post tanking is totally worth reaching that goal✨✨✨. . . . I’m hence SO pumped to be hosting a special one day workshop on June 30th with my friend and talented photographer @silvia_salvialimone 💕right here in #London. . . . . We’ll be focusing on shooting and styling #vegan cake and learning the principles of styling and composition focusing on an organic, natural look that looks elegant and effortless. We’ll also delve deep into the art of editing in Lightroom. We’d love to have you ✨💪🏼✨. . . . .

user_18;user_18193.jpg;INSTAGRAM ALGORITHMS ARE AWESOME! Said no one ever! 😆Or did they? 🤨🧐🤓 . . . Well, you may be surprised to learn that last year I stumbled across this guy on twitter who was raving about how awesome the algorithms are and how his blog traffic and business had exploded since they were introduced. WHAT!? I thought - as did a number of perplexed tweeters. HOW? He explained that he used instagram ads and promoted posts and noted that IG algorithms’ ability to target the right audience for his blog was incredible!😏 . . . That different take on the algorithm stuck with me, so much so that when I heard THE social media expert @garyvee ✨REPEATEDLY say that entrepreneurs/business owners/probloggers who don’t use IG ads now, whilst they were still affordable, are making a MASSIVE mistake, I took serious note. Was I playing it small by not going down the paid instagram route?🤔 . . . So for the first time ever this year I played it bigger and invested in instagram ads 😅. I also did a little survey asking YOU about your thoughts and experiences with instagram ads, as well as researching the topic further online and combining all my findings with my personal experience and the results were, well interesting 😎. . . . To make things easier, I wrote everything up on a blog post AND created an #eatcaptureshare podcast episode on the topic too, you know for those of you who prefer to consume content on the go 🏃🏽‍♀️. . . . . Easy swipe up option in stories and bio today as well as the cut and paste option below. Hope it gives you food for thought 💓💓💓💓. . . . . https://user_18.co.uk/blog/are-instagram-ads-worth-it . . . . . . . . #vegan #veganuk #foodphotography #foodblogger #flatlayforever #whatveganseat #communityovercompetition #podcast #beautifulcuisines #lovetrumpshate #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #bestofvegan #f52grams #feedfeedvegan #veganbreakfast #eattherainbow #hautecuisines #foodandwine #thatsdarling #rawvegan #healthyliving #user_18 #gloobyfood #plantbased #poweredbyplants #creativityfound
user_18;user_18194.jpg;CREATIVITY IS CONTAGIOUS! PASS IT ON! ✨✨✨ . . . I love this quote SO much because when I think about it, it’s the principle on which I build The Little Plantation - I feel in my heart that my tiny corner in cyberspace is here to bringing like-minded people together to explore creativity and styling through the medium of food. ✨💓✨💓✨💓✨ . . . I also believe that magic happens when a group of people arrive in a communal space with an open heart and curious mind, eager to explore the art of visual story telling, learning, sharing and exploring, all that food styling has to offer⭐️. That collective energy can bring out so much more in each one of us compared to working on our own. What do you think? 😘 . . . For this reason @silvia_salvialimone and I created a BRAND NEW 1-day June workshop, focusing on teaching you the principles of cake styling, editing and effortless, organic composition. We’d so love to have you💓💓💓💓! . . . You can find the link below, in my bio, my IG highlight called workshop or today over on stories.

user_18;user_18195.jpg;What 1 colour best describes YOU and your instagram? 💙💚🧡❤️💛I’d LOVE to know.💓 . . . On that note, I am speaking with colour expert and brand strategist @bonniejoymarie about colour theory, the colour wheel and how to use both to enhance your instagram and overall brand💪🏼on the #eatcaptureshare podcast this week🎙. She shares soooo many branding tips as well as ideas on how to stay on top of colour trends, how to play with colour on instagram and where to find inspiration ⭐️. . . .

user_18;user_18197.jpg;ANNOUNCEMENT! . . . SO excited to announce that I’m hosting my last in person #foodstyling workshop for this season with foodie bestie @silvia_salvialimone on June 30th right here in #London! . . .

It’s a BRAND NEW workshop format and I’d love to have you.

user_18;user_18198.jpg;Is self publishing pathetic? 😳 . . . This week it’s all about book writing and creativity here at TLP HQ and I’m asking some BIG, bold, but important questions surrounding these two topics as they are SO important to us food bloggers, food photographers influencers and dreamers✨✨✨. . . I mean who doesn’t dream about writing or photographing a book? 🌟💪🏼 . . . As I’m current (painstakingly 😅) going through the book writing process myself, many of you have kindly suggested I explore self publishing. In the #eatcaptureshare podcast this week I explained why this is NOT an option I’m considering at the moment. . . . FULL DISCLOSURE! It is NOT because I think self publishing is pathetic. In fact I think it’s really brave 💪🏼, yet at the same time I do perceive traditional publishing as more ‘respectable.’ Does that make sense? . . . . Interestingly my most favourite cookbook that I purchased this year started out as a self-published book and - as it did SO well - was quickly picked up by one of the coolest publishers in the US😎💥🔥. . . . Hence, I would genuinely LOVE your thoughts on the matter - do you think less of an author if he/she/they self publish? Would YOU ever self publish. Can’t wait to read your thoughts 💓. . . . . P.S. You can find the podcast episode about book writing here https://user_18.co.uk/eat-capture-share-podcast/how-to-start-writing-a-book as well as on stories and my bio for a simple swipe up. . . . . P.P.S.

user_18;user_18199.jpg;Want to know what sets cookbook writers apart from EVERYONE else?!?🤓 . . . . They don’t just SAY they’re gonna write a cookbook, they actually DO it! ✊🏽😎💥 . . . I know that many of you reading these lines would like to turn your vision into a reality or - if nothing else - actually START taking the first steps towards turning your cookbook idea into something real and tangible. . . . If that’s you then come hang with me all week as it’s book writing and creativity week here at TLP HQ #creativityfound! All week I’ll be sharing content on my IG grid, on stories, on the podcast and the blog to help you get started, to discuss the biggest questions/stumbling blocks that may be coming up for you in that process and to provide practical tips to break through them💪🏼. . . . We’re kickstarting the week with a brand new #eatcaptureshare podcast episode entitled HOW TO WRITE A BOOK (part1), where I share 5 steps on getting started, how I have dealt with rejection and more details about what my book is actually about 🙈 PLUS I share some exciting news too. . . . . I’ll pop the link to the podcast below or just head to stories or my bio for a super easy swipe up. . . . . P.S. My writing desk doesn’t look quite as cute cuz sadly writing isn’t always a bed of roses 😆, but I prepped this scene as a THANK YOU to my creative mastermind group (AND TO YOU!) who are keeping me accountable ✨✨✨✨✨. . . . .
