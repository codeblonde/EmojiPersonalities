user_2;user_23.jpg;So guess who turned 22 today? 🥳🤭 It’s pretty crazy to think that I’ve been on this platform since I was 15! What amazes me even more is the fact that so many of you have been on this journey with me since the very beginning (thank you) 🥺 If 22 year old me had told my 15 year old self that I’d be running my own full-time business online/from home, become a published author at 21 years old and basically be living my dream job I would have laughed and said “Pfft I wish” 🤨😅 Over the years I also developed a really healthy relationship with food whilst also discovering my love for fitness (namely, powerlifting) which have been incredible!! It’s really strange how things work out sometimes but I honestly couldn’t be happier and more grateful for the position that I’m in right now. I really hope you all continue to look forward to the content that I release in the future, I’m forever thankful for this wonderful online community that continues to inspire me on the daily 🥰🙌🏼 #22 #birthday

user_2;user_220.jpg;Noodles all day everyday 😍🤤 Was craving a noodle stir-fry so I decided to whip this up! Only took me about 15 minutes too 👌🏼This is one of those recipes where I don’t measure anything but I’ve left the basic recipe below! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ To prepare your hokkien noodles, bring a saucepan of water to the boil, add your noodles in and after a minute gently separate the strands. You’re not trying to cook the noodles so they will still have quite a bit of a bite to them. Drain and set aside. 2️⃣ Fry up your choice of protein until golden and crispy and set aside. For this dish I decided to use a vegan meat that I bought from the Asian grocers. 3️⃣ Heat up your wok or frypan onto high heat and add a splash of oil. Fry up any veggies you like (I kept it simple and only used gailan & broccolini) for 2-3 minutes until semi cooked. 4️⃣Add in your noodles and protein and season with your favourite sauces. I usually use dark soy sauce (for colour), light soy sauce, sweetener (eg. coconut sugar), pepper and sometimes vegan oyster sauce. 5️⃣ Toss around until everything is well coated and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until veggies and noodles are fully cooked through. If the pan dries up then add a splash of water and continue frying. 6️⃣ At the very end add in a handful of green onions and drizzle with toasted sesame oil. Turn off the heat and serve. I topped mine with more green onion and sesame seeds! Fresh chilli would have been good too 🌶 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Everytime I make these dishes it tastes waaay better than take out! Less greasy, I can adjust the flavour and saltiness to my own liking and use my favourite ingredients. Would highly recommend you give this a go. Enjoy 🌱 #ThrivingOnPlants
user_2;user_221.jpg;Who else loves FRUIT?! 😍🙌🏼 It’s by far my favourite snack to have throughout the day 👌🏼 If you’re craving something extra sweet, try including a handful of Israeli Medjool dates for a natural boost of energy.

I’m telling you, you’re not going to believe how damn good the texture and taste is! 👌🏼 Plus, they are gluten-free, oil-free and refined sugar-free 😱 You need to try this asap if you’re after a healthy yet delicious muffin recipe!! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ✨FULL RECIPE✨ [Makes 9-12] ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1️⃣ Preheat your oven to 180°C (conventional and not fan forced!). In a small bowl combine ⅓ cup lemon juice, zest of 2 lemons, ⅔ cup maple syrup (or your fav liquid sweetener. Rice malt syrup will make it less sweet if that’s what you prefer!), ⅔ cup almond milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Whisk well. 2️⃣ In a large bowl, whisk together 1⅔ buckwheat flour, ⅔ cup blanched almond meal, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp sea salt. 3️⃣ Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mix and mix until you end up with a smooth batter.

Happy baking and I hope you love this recipe as much as I do! 🤭

Topped with @thesourcebulkfoods hemp seeds because I literally add it onto every single one of my meals 🤭🥑🌱✨ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 👉 Here’s how I made the tofu + eggplant [This makes about 2 big serves or 3-4 smaller serves] 1️⃣ Cube 450g firm tofu (1 block) and 1 medium eggplant and add into a large bowl. 2️⃣ Season to taste with about 2 tbsp dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp maple syrup, 1 tbsp sesame oil and ground white pepper. I also tossed it in some Asian mushroom stock powder and sesame seeds. 3️⃣ Spread onto a lined baking tray. Bake in a 180*C preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until golden. 4️⃣ As a bonus, here’s an easy peanut sauce recipe you can serve your bowl with. Mix together 1 tbsp natural peanut butter, 2 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp maple syrup, sriracha to taste, 1/2 tbsp @purecocobella natural coconut yogurt and water/mylk to thin it out. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I think this is now my favourite way to cook both tofu & eggplant… 🍆 It’s soo simple yet so delicious!

Place in freezer until slightly set. In the meantime, add 2 tsp ground coffee into the remaining mix and blend. Pour onto vanilla layer until 2/3 of the way full. Return to freezer. 3️⃣For the last layer, add in 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder and blend. Pour on top of coffee layer to fill moulds completely. Set in the freezer overnight. 4️⃣ When ready to serve, remove from moulds and decorate. I used @loving_earth choc (dark, caramel & nutty maple), cacao beans, cacao nibs, crushed pecans and an extra sprinkle of ground coffee! 👌🏼 Allow them to thaw at room temp for 10-15 mins before serving so they’re nice and creamy 🙂 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ They’re the perfect treat to pop out of the freezer whenever you’re craving something sweet! You can also make extra mini versions so you have plenty to snack on throughout the month!! Enjoy 🥰✨ #ThrivingOnPlants

user_2;user_2101.jpg;CREAMY PUMPKIN PASTA 😍🍃 I made the most simple yet delicious pumpkin sauce to go with my pasta & oh myyy am I obsessed 🤤 You gotta try this out for your next pasta night, here’s the recipe: . 1️⃣ Preheat oven to 200*C. Cut up 750g butternut pumpkin/squash into large chunks, 1 large onion into quarters & peel 2 garlic cloves. Place onto a lined baking tray and bake for 40 minutes until golden. 2️⃣ In the meantime, cook one packet of @SanRemoPasta pulse pasta according to packet instructions.

user_2;user_2132.jpg;Big Vegan Breakfast 👌🏼😄 My bf & I were craving something like this on Sunday morning and instead of going out I thought I’d try to whip something up in 30 mins 😂 👉 There’s wholemeal toast, roast potatoes (cut up small to cook quicker), tofu (woulda made scramble but this one was pre-marinated/store bought so I just pan fried it), sautéed baby spinach, pan fried tomato, baked beans & avocado 🥑🍅🍞 Not too shabby considering the fact that I was pretty much using up leftover ingredients 😬 Next time I’ll be making a tofu scramble instead! Some other ideas of what you can include on your plate are sautéed mushrooms, hashbrowns and vegan sausages 🙌🏼 ✨ Who else loves savoury breakfasts?! 😎 . . . #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodshare #veganism #vegansofig #veganfoodideas #foodie #veganfoodinspo #whatveganseat #govegan #crueltyfree #food #foodinspo #healthy #health #healthyrecipe #plantbased #plantpowered #mealinspo #foodshare #plantfoods #user_2

user_2;user_2139.jpg;✨My Zero-Waste Pantry✨ . So as many of you know I’ve been trying to make a bigger effort to try minimise and/or eliminate waste in my home & the easiest place for me to do this is starting off in my kitchen! 🙏🏼 . After going to @zerowastehome’s Sydney talk, I recently decided to invest in some new large jars with the clip on lid, let me say... best decision EVER 🙌🏼 I used to always have missing or mismatching lids/jars which I found was quite a problem for me as I kept having to buy extras! I filled these large jars with some of my absolute staples, including buckwheat flour, wholewheat flour, granola, buckinis, beans, legumes, pasta & quinoa 😍 . As a @thesourcebulkfoods ambassador, I’ve been stocking up on their package-free goods for years now and they make it SO much easier for me to live this lifestyle 🌱♻️🌏 . Every single one of us can do our bit in helping to reduce & eliminate waste, do what is possible in your means and try to be more conscious of what you decide to purchase and support 💚 #zerowaste

user_2;user_2177.jpg;Loaded Veggie & Sausage Spaghetti 😍🍝 Yep, all #vegan! Made using @vegiedelights vegie sausages 👌🏼🌱 ✨To make, simply: Cook pasta > drain before it’s fully cooked (will continue to cook later) & set aside. For the sauce, saute 1 stalk diced celery, 1 diced onion, 1 diced carrot, 1 diced red capsicum, 2 cloves garlic for 4-5 minutes. Add in 2 punnets cherry tomatoes, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 500g tomato passata, 2 cups water & 1/2 tbsp mixed herbs. Simmer for 20 minutes until thickened, add in one packet of sliced @vegiedelights sausages and pasta and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Serve with fresh basil and vegan parmesan! 🤩💛🙌🏼 The sausages add really nice texture to the dish + they’re high in iron & b12, not to mention they tastes amazing! Hope you try this recipe out and love it as much as I do 😄🙏🏼 #sponsored #vegiedelightscollab #meatfreemadeeasy #ittastesgreattobevegiegood

In terms of other things you’ll find in my fridge, there’s tofu, vegan miso paste, juice, home-made chia puddings & different stir-fry sauces and dressings on the side 👌🏼 I’ve showed you my pantry where I store all of my dried goods (nuts & nut butters, seeds, flours, dried fruit) in jars but thought you’d also like this sneakpeek of what you can find in my fridge 😌🙏🏼✨ Seriously though, how amazing do plant-based foods look (and taste)?! 🌱😍

user_2;user_2196.jpg;Sunday brunch at @twosispyrmont ✨💛🌱 What a way to start the day! Is this not one of the cutest cafes ever?! 😍👌🏼 So as some of you may have watched in my stories, they currently don’t have many veg options but they were SO accomodating & easily tweaked their current meals to make it vegan 😳🙌🏼 We ordered: 🌸 Quinoa Goreng with Pan Fried Tofu (my fav dish) 🌸 Green Breaky Bowl with Coconut Dusted Sweet Potato Wedges 🌸 Poached Tofu Bowl (w/ the best dressing, ever) 🌸 Rose & Blue Latte with Bonsoy + they had a range of fresh juices that I wanted to try but @kaiweinbeck & I felt like sipping on something warm that morning 😌🍵💨 ‼️OK SO here’s the exciting part: They’re currently developing some vegan meals to go onto their menu (think waffles, burgers...) & I’m soo excited😍 Will keep you all updated with it but even supporting their current vegan options would be amazing to show them there’s a demand for it 🍃🙏🏼🌟

user_2;user_2198.jpg;Buddha Bowls give me life 😍✨🍚🌱 So your girl is finally back in Sydney and ready to whip up more recipes in the kitchen, WOOO!!! 🎉😎This is the first savoury meal I've made & eaten since getting back and I'm definitely not complaining 👌🏼 This bowl is filled with falafel, tofu, wholewheat tortillas on the side, lettuce, red cabbage, spiralized carrots, spiralized cucumber, peas, corn, @thesourcebulkfoods pepitas + hemp seeds + sesame seeds & a simple yet amazing dressing! 👅 ✅ Let's be real, dressings are key to making your salads and buddha bowls taste amazing! 🗝 ✅ Here's the highly requested recipe for the sauce I made: A spoon of home-made cashew butter (or sub for almond/peanut butter), splash of soy sauce or tamari, dash of coconut sugar, ground black pepper, sesame oil, ground ginger & garlic & water to thin it out! 💦 Adjust creaminess/saltiness/sweetness to your own liking, ENJOY 🙏🏼😘🌟
user_2;user_2199.jpg;"Baked sweet potatoes 😍🍠✨ I always get questions about how I ""bake"" my potato fries and so here it is: ✅ Wash & peel your potatoes, then make sure you thoroughly dry them with a clean cloth/paper towel ✅ Add a drizzle of oil if desired, I find that only sweet potatoes may need some because they don't crisp up as easily as regular potatoes ✅ Add in a few tsp of your favourite herbs/spices! I love adding in mixed herbs, garlic powder, onion powder & smoked paprika to mine ✅ My secret is that I pop it into my AIRFRYER for 45-50 minutes at 180*C until golden & crispy! An airfryer essentially ""fries"" your food minus the oil + with little mess & effort! I'd say it's definitely worth investing in one 👌🏼 If you don't have one then simply place on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper & make sure they're separate/not touching each other too much. Bake on one side for 25 mins at 180*C, flip & bake for another 20 mins! ✨ ✅ I always serve mine with a good heaping of greens & a dollop of guac or sour cream + @thesourcebulkfoods hemp seeds for a dose of good fats 😙 ❇️ Enjoy!! It's really simple and just takes a little bit of patience 🤓 While they're baking it gives you time to make your salad + prep other things anyway so it works out great in my opinion 😎✌🏼 #vegan #potatoarelife #iliveandbreathepotatoes"
