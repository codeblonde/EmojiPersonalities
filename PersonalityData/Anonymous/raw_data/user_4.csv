user_4;user_429.jpg;morning thoughts🦋 we live in a suppressive culture. On every level our culture teaches us from birth to death to suppress what we feel to the greater good. To suppress our opinions in case they cause trouble. To suppress our emotions to keep things nice and often even to suppress our abilities so as not to stick out from the crowd. We’re simply taught to suppress. I am happy my parents always taught me to allow all my feelings & feel the emotions. But the older I got the more I forgot about these... I started to suppress my feelings, as it’s common in our culture & society. Meditation really helps me to release my emotions. I notice tension in my body & try to let these go. It naturally lead to the emotional energy that caused me to tighten up, to suddenly express my feelings. Today’s meditation was intense. I allowed my feelings to flow - my tears were rolling down my cheeks & I am feeling better now. ❤️🦋 this beautiful bra is from @aloyoga love their new color drop !! #meditation #morning

user_4;user_431.jpg;Yes there is fear. Yes there is isolation. Yes there is panic buying. Yes there is sickness. Yes there is even death. But, They say that in Wuhan after so many years of noise You can hear the birds again. They say that after just a few weeks of quiet The sky is no longer thick with fumes But blue and grey and clear. They say that in the streets of Assisi People are singing to each other across the empty squares, keeping their windows open so that those who are alone may hear the sounds of family around them. They say that a hotel in the West of Ireland Is offering free meals and delivery to the housebound. Today a young woman I know is busy spreading fliers with her number through the neighbourhood So that the elders may have someone to call on. Today Churches, Synagogues, Mosques and Temples are preparing to welcome and shelter the homeless, the sick, the weary All over the world people are slowing down and reflecting All over the world people are looking at their neighbours in a new way All over the world people are waking up to a new reality To how big we really are. To how little control we really have. To what really matters. To Love. So we pray and we remember that Yes there is fear. But there does not have to be hate. Yes there is isolation. But there does not have to be loneliness. Yes there is panic buying. But there does not have to be meanness. Yes there is sickness. But there does not have to be disease of the soul Yes there is even death. But there can always be a rebirth of love. Wake to the choices you make as to how to live now. Today, breathe. Listen, behind the factory noises of your panic The birds are singing again The sky is clearing, Spring is coming, And we are always encompassed by Love. Open the windows of your soul And though you may not be able to touch across the empty square, Sing.❤️#lockdown by #richardhendrick

user_4;user_464.jpg;perspectives 🦋 If you are only thinking about problems and sorrows, that’s exactly what are you going to attract in your life. If you change your perspective and start thinking about solutions and opportunities, you are sending vibrations to attract an abundance of them. Instead of complaining that you are late and the traffic is so bad, be happy you made it safely sitting in a vehicle with heating/ac. Nothing is going to change if you aren’t willing to change yourself. Things aren’t going to change on their own, you have to take ownership of them. Be confident about yourself and take that leap of faith. Be a little proactive rather than being victimized by your situation. Things will automatically start shaping up in a favorable way when you start acting on them. Now, you decide — if you want to act or be acted upon. 🤍🤍🤍 Talking about this and a lot more about a healthy mindset in my ebook! 🦋🦋🦋 My fave creators and I compiled a bundle of 60 (!!) super interesting ebooks all about being and living a vegan/plant-based, fit and sustainable lifestyle. 📚 And the best part about it is that it’s only 50$!!
