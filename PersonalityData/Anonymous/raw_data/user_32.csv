user_32;user_324.jpg;I made a pledge to myself at the beginning of this year 💫 To only do things that spark joy and that I’m truly passionate about. To only spend time with people who bring joy and positivity into my life. To focus on myself and my wellbeing before anyone else’s. It’s been a crazy 6 months, but I’m happier than ever in this moment. It’s amazing what a few months can do 🌻 This is a reminder to take time for yourself today, and every day!

user_32;user_325.jpg;repost from @madfit.ig 🤍  My heart is heavy. I have found it very hard to put any of this into words over the past few days. I know that I am privileged because of the colour of my skin and I will never truly understand the injustices that many people in this world will/have faced. - - Staying silent in times of injustice is privilege. Please use your voice. It is up to us to stand up for justice and equality today and every day. Change must happen now. - - I see you, I hear you, I mourn with you, & I will fight for you. 💔 Ways you can help: https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/  #blacklivesmatter #blacklivesmatter #blacklivesmatter

user_32;user_3213.jpg;repost from my fitness page @madfit.ig 💫  I know it can be hard to stay positive during such uncertain times, but it’s important that we stick together and do what we can to lift our spirits up 💫  Here are a few things that have been helping me stay positive & sane: 👉🏼 ROUTINE: Staying in a routine as much as possible has helped me stay focused and productive... and therefore happier! 👉🏼 FACETIMING FRIENDS/FAMILY: We are social beings! It’s hard (especially if you live alone) to be isolated for long periods of time. Pick up the phone and chat with a friend/family member! Or even do an activity together like cook or workout! 👉🏼 MOVING MY BODY: Taking time each day to move your body (even if its only for a few minutes a day) will totally change your mental state! 👉🏼EXTRA SELF CARE: Make it a priority to de-stress! Use this extra time to give yourself a little extra lovin’! Face masks, bubble baths, reading a book, yoga are all great ways to take your mind off things! 👉🏼GRATITUDE: Reminding myself or writing sown what I’m grateful for each day puts things into perspective! I hope you all are doing ok ❤️ We will make it through this together!

user_32;user_3233.jpg;I’ve avoided talking about this because it’s not something I feel ready to share. I’m not sure I will ever feel ready. Dealing with personal obstacles in life is one thing, but having to share and be open with an audience is a whole other ball game. I do feel as though I should grant you an explanation, as you’ve shared many amazing memories with us and have been apart of our lives. But, this is still so fresh and deeply personal... it’s very, very hard. As some of you may have heard, Kyle and I have decided to no longer continue our romantic relationship - but instead focus on building a better friendship and staying focused on our passions and our work together. We have SO much love and respect for each other... this was not an easy decision. But, I believe we will learn, grow, and become stronger people from this. What does this mean? Nothing is really changing, besides what happens in our personal lives. We are still (even more so) focused on building a community and our work. We will still be taking on big and very exciting adventures together. The past few months have been some of the hardest times to navigate in my life. Break ups (no matter what the circumstances) fucking suck. Understandably, I’ve been hesitant to share anything as we are still trying to process and understand things ourselves. Times are still very hard, confusing, sad, frustrating... listening to your heart can be fucking difficult. I am incredibly thankful for the amazing human that Kyle is. I am excited to continue this journey together, take on new ventures in life together, and start building an even more meaningful relationship with him. He means so much to me. I’m not sure what the future holds. But, if it’s meant to be, it will be. I need to take this time to grow and love myself more as a person. I don’t expect anyone to understand. Everyone moves through situations in life differently. Thank you for all the kind words of support, and also respecting our privacy during this tough time. Onwards and upwards 💫 I’ll be back soon 🤍

user_32;user_3250.jpg;✨REPOST from my fitness page @madfit.ig ✨ Healthy eating is a key component when it comes to achieving sustainable fitness and health goals 🔑 Unfortunately, many struggle with finding the #motivation to eat healthy all the time. Here’s a few of my tips: 👉🏼 It’s not a DIET, it’s a LIFESTYLE change. Instead of jumping on a 30-day fad diet (that usually includes intense caloric restriction, etc), make changes to your pre- existing diet that will help you build a healthy relationship with food & your body LONG TERM while simultaneously reaching your goals. 👉🏼 Eat TASTY food! There’s no need to limit yourself to boring, tasteless combos of food just to be “healthy”. Find healthy meals that you ENJOY eating (this way you will want to include them regularly). If you’re looking for #healthyfoodinspo check out my personal account @user_32 here and on YouTube (I also have 2 cookbooks)! 👉🏼 BABY STEPS! Start by taking things one step at a time. Reduce the processed foods, try eating 1 healthy/#plantbased meal per day, swap sugary drinks for water, etc. 👉🏼 HOW DO YOU FEEL? Notice how you feel... lighter, happier, more energized? Appreciate that and make a mental note! This will inspire you to choose healthier foods more often! The more good food you eat, the more good food you crave and vice versa! Hope these tips help! If you have any more... leave them below 👇🏼 . . . #healthyeatingmotivation #healthyeatingideas #madfit #eathealthystayfit #user_32 #eatgoodfeelgood #healthyeating #workout #fitness #fitnessmotivation #oatmealbowl #homeworkout #healthgoals #fitnessgoals #healthyinspiration #girlswithcurls #sportsbra

user_32;user_3264.jpg;HOUSEPLANTS: DO YOU HAVE ANY? 👇🏼 Over the past 4 or so months I’ve developed a deep passion for plants 🌿 (if you haven’t noticed already). I love the sense of grounding and connection to nature they bring inside my home 🏡 I truly believe that plants help us heal in many ways. They improve air quality, increase creativity - just looking at my plants brings me feelings of happiness and peace. They give me a bigger sense of purpose and help me to be more mindful and present in my day to day life. Watching them grow and thrive reminds me of the beauty of nature and makes me feel like a proud plant mom 😍🌿 I could go on and on, but I’ll save you the novel 😂 I’m editing a HOUSEPLANT TOUR video for my YouTube channel today so stay tuned!

user_32;user_3273.jpg;“what made her strong was despite the million things that hurt her, she spoke of nothing. Nothing but happiness”- J.A ✨ I came across this quote today and it was something that really resonated with me. Despite the hardships we move through in life, the only thing that truly matters is happiness. What you put out into the world you will receive back. I consider myself to be a strong woman. Not because of what I’ve been through but because of my positive, abundant outlook, and the lessons I’ve learned and continue to learn in life. Everything always comes back to gratitude 🙏🏼 There is always something to be grateful for.

user_32;user_3279.jpg;“I am not a product of my circumstance, of my environment, or of my childhood. I am a product of the decisions I have made, the company that I keep, and the purpose that I pursue.” 💫 I love this quote. It’s a great reminder that YOU are in control. Your past, your circumstances, and your environment does not define you. Choose to surround yourself with people who inspire you, and push you to be a better human. Remember that you are in control of the decisions you make for yourself. Choose to pursue things that spark joy, bring value and purpose into your life ✨ If you want to make a change in your life, you have the power to do so! So, what are you waiting for? 💡

I didn’t always have the confidence to create and post content online. But, the best way to gain confidence is to do something that scares you! Having a great support system around you is important too (@kylemfraser 😘). It’s been about 4 years now, we are just under 10k away from hitting 1 MILLION subscribers on MadFit, and I couldn’t be more excited 🥳 So, if you’re in need of that little push to do something... this is your sign! JUST DO IT 🙌🏼
user_32;user_3282.jpg;This bowl brings me back to our Cape Town days ✨🇿🇦 Coconut yogurt and fresh fruit was a huge staple meal for us while we were living there! This bowl is a great way to start the day! A great energy source and super satiating! I added some hemp seeds on top for some extra protein (and because they’re delicious 😋). Hope you guys are having a great start to your weekend! 💛
user_32;user_3283.jpg;when life gets hectic and you feel overwhelmed, take a moment to focus on the people and things you are most grateful for 💫🙏🏼 3 THINGS I AM GRATEFUL FOR TODAY ARE: 1. My family and friends 👫 I don’t always see them as often as I should, but when I do I am reminded of just how special these people are in my life. 2. The beautiful country I live in! 🇨🇦 I’ve travelled lots, and I never seemed to appreciate my home as much. I’m grateful to live in such a safe & beautiful place. 3. My health & my body ✨ It is in no way perfect, and we are still on this ever changing journey together, but I’m grateful to be in good health and to be able to move my body every day. Something we can easily take for granted. YOUR TURN 👇🏼👇🏼 What are you grateful for today? These photos were taken on a beach day spent with friends ❤️ one of the ways to really fill up my cup! 🌊

user_32;user_3285.jpg;What’s something you’ve always dreamt of doing, but haven’t yet? 💫 Thinking about the future and everything we would like to accomplish can sometimes be daunting. To me, the future holds endless possibilities. Anything I dream of, I know I can achieve. Always believe something wonderful is about to happen in your life. Have a mindset of abundance and positivity when thinking about the future. The only thing that will stop you from fulfilling your dreams is you! 💡 💭 Haven’t taken or posted a selfie in a long time 🤪... just wanted to share some of my thoughts with you 💛 Have a beautiful day today!

user_32;user_3287.jpg;a gal and her plants 🍃✨ they truly bring a lot of joy into my life. Learning how to take care of them, watching them push out new growth, and the fact that I haven’t managed to kill any yet is somehow very fulfilling 😅 Having something to tend to and take care of, other than myself gives me a sense of purpose. It’s apart of my “self care” routine. They remind me to slow down and focus on the basics. Drink water, get some sunshine... we’re basically just house plants with more complicated emotions 🍃🌞
user_32;user_3288.jpg;FALAFEL BOWL 🥙 ✨ for the recipe, check out my NEW YouTube video (link in bio)! I share what I eat in a day + some easy healthy recipes for MEAL PREP! 👏🏼 Let’s quickly touch on the idea of “meal prep” for a second. When eating a healthy, whole food focused, plant-based diet it’s important that we are PREPARED! Making healthy eating CONVENIENT is key 🔑 most of us live very busy lives and don’t have much time when it comes to preparing meals. It’s easy to grab some frozen/boxed/processed meals at the store, and although it may save us on time it’s usually more EXPENSIVE and not as healthy for us! My idea of meal prepping is making some of my favourite healthy recipes that keep well in the fridge or freezer and work in multiple dishes (think soups/stews, falafels/bean patties, etc). 👉🏼My latest YouTube video is PACKED with more meal prep tips and 5 different healthy recipes you can make to keep you on track & prepared! What’s your FAV recipe to make ahead of time?? 👇🏼👇🏼
user_32;user_3289.jpg;Spending time outdoors makes me happiest ✨🍃 WHY YOU SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME OUTSIDE: 👉🏼MENTAL HEALTH- It’s been proven that spending more time outdoors can improve things like anxiety, depression, stress levels, etc. 👉🏼 ADDS VARIETY TO YOUR EXERCISE ROUTINE- Hiking, walking, cycling, yoga, sports, are all amazing forms of exercise outdoors! It’s always great to add variety to your workouts and get fresh air & sunshine while doing so! 👉🏼 RECHARGE YOUR BATTERY- Spending time in nature is so revitalizing! Your environment is so important for overall health. Most of us spend majority of our time inside, either at a desk or staring at a screen. It can be draining! Get outside and recharge ⚡️ What’s your favourite way to spend time outside? 😍👇🏼
user_32;user_3290.jpg;Reminiscing on Hawaii days 🌊🌞 most definitely my favourite place I have ever lived! But, so happy to be enjoying Canadian summer!! Canadian summer is the best. Can’t wait to be back in my bikini by the water 😍 Happy Canada Day long weekend to all my Canadians out there 🇨🇦 ❤️ proud to be Canadian and blessed to live in this beautiful country! 🙏🏼

user_32;user_3292.jpg;HAPPY SUMMER SOLSTICE 🌞💫 Summer is my absolute favourite season. Sunshine, warmth - everything in nature is in full effect! Including watermelons 😍🍉 Very excited for all of the watermelon I’ll be eating this summer season! ✨HOW TO TELL IF A WATERMELON IS RIPE/SWEET: 👉🏼 FIRMNESS - Feel to see if the watermelon is firm (especially on either end). If it has some give... no good! 👉🏼 YELLOW SPOT - Check for a dark yellow spot on the melon! This spot means the melon was in the field ripening for a while, and will be more sweet 😍 👉🏼WEIGHT - Does your melon feel heavy for its size? That’s a good sign! This means it’s dense, sweet, and full of water! 👉🏼SOUND - Tap/spank your watermelon 😏 Does it sound dull? Or more like a deep hollow sound? Dull sounding melons tend to be under/overripe! Make sure to check for these things next time you’re picking up a watermelon😍 Also, try it with a squeeze of lime juice! Best combo ever!
user_32;user_3293.jpg;plants, moving my body, and love 🌿✨ I fill my days up with doing things I’m most passionate about. Manifesting the things I want. Executing steps toward my dreams.

user_32;user_3294.jpg;Smoky Sweet Potato Tempeh Tacos 🌮 😍 Recipe is in my latest YouTube video: Maddie Lymburner! These tacos would be perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! I prepped some roasted, diced sweet potato the night before which made making these tacos insanely quick and easy! They were the perfect post workout meal after leg day 🤤 A huge part of staying consistent with eating healthy for me is being organized and prepared! Simple things like prepping cooked sweet potato, or making extra granola for the next few days really saves a lot of time and makes making meals super convenient! 👏🏼
user_32;user_3295.jpg;How to get started living a healthier lifestyle? ✨ You could follow list of new stipulations to follow to “be healthy”... but for most, trying to make a ton of changes to your lifestyle overnight is overwhelming! Then this leads us into the viscous circle of not living up to our “standards”, being disappointed in ourselves, going back to our old ways, and starting from square one 🙅🏼‍♀️ My 3 biggest tips for you: • BABY STEPS: don’t feel you need to change your entire lifestyle overnight. • SET MINI GOALS: Set yourself a goal for the week! Maybe that’s drinking enough water everyday, getting in 30 mins of exercise every day, including 1 plant based meal everyday, etc. And CELEBRATE those accomplished goals! • TUNE INTO YOUR BODY: ask yourself “how am I feeling today?” What do I need right now?” Listening to your body is so important when it comes to overall health and well-being! Listen to your body, and HONOURING what you need in the moment is key ✨ Do you have any other tips that helped you start a healthier lifestyle? Anything you are struggling with right now?

user_32;user_3298.jpg;Eating plant based doesn’t need to be complicated or extravagant 🍃 this meal took me only a few minutes to throw together.

user_32;user_32100.jpg;how to be happier right NOW 💫: • embrace yourself - for everything you are, everything you’ve become, and everything you will be. • create & meet goals -work toward something, get passionate, and work hard. • find inspiration- surround yourself with people who inspire you, teach you new things, and bring you up. • celebrate everything - both the big and the small. • forget the destination - enjoy your journey and appreciate the highs and lows that come with it.

The waffle recipe is from my ebook “What I Eat for Life” and I topped it off with fresh berries, coconut whipped cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup! Are you a waffle or pancake person? 🤔🥞 I will always choose waffles!
user_32;user_32103.jpg;how to have a productive day? 🌞 here’s my basic morning routine: 1. Take time for myself first thing in the morning ✨ aka: shower, stretch, drink water, make tea, play with Jack, and take care of my plants 🍃 2. Make a healthy & delicious breakfast ✨ usually this delicious smoothie (recipe in last post or latest youtube video) or some oatmeal! 3. Create a “to-do” list for the day ✨ being your own boss means staying extra organized and extra accountable for your work! I’m a huge list person and it really helps me stay on track 🙌🏼 What does your morning routine for a productive day look like? These basic 3 steps are so important to my routine, especially making time for myself in the morning 🙏🏼 Happy Monday friends! Have a great week 🙌🏼

user_32;user_32106.jpg;Swipe to see all the cuteness 😍  We’ve taken the past couple weeks to re-group, get re-inspired, and settle into our new home 🌿🌞 which is why I’ve been a little quiet! BUT ☝🏼 I’ve just posted a brand NEW VLOG on my youtube channel updating y’all about what’s been going on + I share a couple recipes 😋 I think it’s important to take a step back once in a while to re-evaluate, rest, and re-group. I feel much more inspired, creative, and motivated 🙌🏼 So many things coming your way in the next couple months...I can hardly wait 🤪🤩 much love ❤️❤️❤️
user_32;user_32107.jpg;Officially a new mum to 7 plant babies 🌿🍃 plants bring me so much joy and happiness! Surrounding myself with them in my new space is a dream come true ✨ A Saturday well spent! Do you have any plant friends in your house? Any newbie tips for me? 🤪
user_32;user_32108.jpg;EASY HEALTHY BREAKFAST 🥣 You guys know I absolutely love oats #alwaysoats They’re quick, filling, delicious, and incredibly healthy for you too! Since being back home in Canada, I’ve had a bowl of oats every day! Getting back into a routine and back to healthy homemade meals 🌱👏🏼 Plant based food doesn’t need to be complicated or difficult to make! Try this for breakfast: • 3/4 cup quick cook steel cut oats (or rolled oats) • 1 1/2 cups water • pinch of salt • 1 tsp ground chia seeds (for those healthy omega-3’s)! • 1 tbsp toasted coconut, pumpkin & sunflower seeds • 1 -1.5 cups mixed berries (I warmed my frozen berries) • 1/2 a banana • Splash of coconut milk (or whatever plant milk you enjoy most)!
user_32;user_32109.jpg;Officially moved into our new home 🏡 🇨🇦 We’re super excited to have a new space and to be back living with the best cat in the world: Jack 🦁 This will be my first home I live in longer than 6 months in over 4 years 😬 Feels good to be home! Moving vlog coming at you tomorrow so stay tuned ❤️
user_32;user_32110.jpg;already missing our island adventures 💫 Still adjusting to being back home in Canada. It’s lightly snowed a few times, and I’ve barely seen the sun peak through the grey skies 🌞 It’s been real nice to spend time with family and fur babies, catching up and relaxing! 😴 Also, thank you all for the lovely well wishes after the latest vlog in the Kyle & Maddie channel! I’m feeling much better now (finally) after that nasty cold 🙏🏼 Updates and videos to come soon ❤️ much love!
user_32;user_32111.jpg;I can’t believe 6 months of travel has come and gone 💫 we are back home, safe and sound, and ready to take on the next chapter in life! Travelling these past 3 years has been the greatest experience of my life. Putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, meeting new people, sharing new experiences... it all allows you to grow and change as a person. I’ve learned so much about myself over these past few years ✨ I am so incredibly blessed to have done the things I’ve done and seen the places I’ve seen in my life. Thank you for always supporting me and joining me on my journey 🙏🏼 I’ll be sharing a little life update soon on what’s going on now that we’re back in Canada 🇨🇦 but for now, I’m trying to get over this nasty cold I got the last few days in Hawaii 🤒 New video from our last day in Kauai will be up on the Kyle and Maddie vlog channel soon 💛
user_32;user_32112.jpg;It’s so hard to encapsulate the beauty of this place in just a few photos ✨💫 Just posted my LAST VLOG (😭) here in Hawaii! Where has the time gone?! Lots of beautiful views like this, plus I share an easy & quick pasta recipe 🌱 Link is in my story! Where is the most beautiful place on earth you’ve been? 🌎 Taking notes for my new bucket list 😏
user_32;user_32113.jpg;My favourite spot to watch sunset 🌅 (swipe) “Sunsets are proof that no matter what happens, each day can end beautifully” 💫 To be honest, this day wasn’t my best. Super intense period pain, lots of tears, cancelled adventures, etc, etc. But, I chose not to allow a bad few hours ruin my entire day. Threw on a baggy t-shirt, and went to watch this epic sunset with the person who makes me smile the most @kylemfraser ❤️ Don’t let bad moments define a bad day. You have the power to turn anything into something positive 🙏🏼 Have a wonderful day today! ✨
user_32;user_32114.jpg;pure magic 💫 each time I come here I am reminded of just how amazing nature truly is 🍃 We took a spontaneous adventure hiking down to this waterfall, my shoes were full of mud, I was covered in mud, but being the only people around was so worth it 🙏🏼 just us, some chickens, and this amazing waterfall 😍  Get outside today, explore a place you’ve never been, take time to really appreciate the nature around you. This earth is so incredibly beautiful. We take it for granted sometimes. Where are you exploring today?
user_32;user_32115.jpg;PRE + POST WORKOUT MEALS 🌱It’s important to nourish your body both before and after your workout! Good nutrition will help you perform better, and help your body recover faster. Before my workouts I like to eat something light, easy to digest, and something that will give me an extra boost of energy. After my workouts I choose something a little heavier and more protein rich. I also make sure to include a scoop of @vivolife protein post workout 💪🏼 Here’s 2 EASY and SIMPLE recipes: PRE WORKOUT: 1/2 cup quick oats 2 tbsp ground sunflower + sesame seeds 1 handful of raisins 1/2 tsp cinnamon 3/4 cup almond milk 1/2 tsp vanilla Toppings: 1 fresh banana Almond butter POST WORKOUT: 1/4 block of extra firm tofu 1/4 cup of marinade (I use coco aminos) 1/2 cup dry white rice 1/2 cup steamed broccoli 1/4 avocado To see the full vlog, check the link in my story 💛
user_32;user_32116.jpg;always grateful 🙏🏼 cherishing every moment spent on the beach and adventuring around this beautiful island 🌊 life’s a dream 💫
user_32;user_32117.jpg;Sometimes the simplest of meals are the best ✨ eating shouldn’t be complicated, or difficult. I whipped this up on a whim in about 5 minutes yesterday and now it’s going to be my breakfast for the next week 😅 The RECIPE will be in my upcoming YouTube video and I’ll also post the recipe here! So make sure you stay tuned 💛
user_32;user_32118.jpg;MORNING MAGIC 💫 I love mornings. It’s my “me time” of the day. Waking up to a new day, preparing my body for a busy day ahead. One of my morning rituals lately has been having a MAGIC latte from @vivolife ! I’m not a coffee drinker, but I love the ritual of having a warm, comforting drink to start the day off with ☕️ I love golden milk (or turmeric lattes), it’s been a go to of mine for a long while! This magic latte also has the addition of Lion’s Mane mushroom 🍄 which is great for the brain and fighting inflammation in the body 💛 What’s your go-to morning drink? ☕️ You can use code: MADDIE10 to receive a discount on any @vivolife products! 🙌🏼 Check my story for details!
user_32;user_32119.jpg;So grateful for this life with you 💫
user_32;user_32120.jpg;Buy local, and support farmers whenever possible! 🌱 Here in Hawaii, we get 95% of all our produce at the markets from local farmers. Not only is it supporting the local community, but it’s actually much cheaper and most of the time much better quality than anything you can find in a shop 🙌🏼 Why buy an avocado shipped all the way from Mexico, when you can buy an avocado grown on the island by a local farmer? 👏🏼 This is something I’d like to continue to do as much as possible back at home. Although we might not be able to get as much variety year round in Canada, we will have to buy whatever is in season locally. Do you have any type of market near you? Do you go? Why or why not?
user_32;user_32121.jpg;most of my days consist of wearing bikinis, and frolicking barefoot around this magical island 💫🧚‍♀️ knowing that my time here is limited, makes me intensely grateful for each day spent here. Which sparked another thought :💭 Our time here on this earth is limited, it could end any day. Why don’t I feel this much gratitude every day? It’s easy to get caught up in the game of life. Going to work, doing errands, taking the kids to soccer practice, going to this appointment, making the deadline for that assignment, etc. When we are in our normal “routines” and in stressful situations, it can be hard to stay grateful and in this mindset. It’s important to take time to slow down and appreciate life. It doesn’t last forever. This is why I speak of practicing gratitude so much. Taking a simple 10 minutes each day to slow down and express gratitude (for anything) will change your entire mentality 💫 Appreciate the small things, get outside, tell your loved ones they are loved. Time is limited! What are you grateful for today?
user_32;user_32122.jpg;POTATO NACHOS 🥔😍 I had been craving these for a while now and finally made them the other night! To see how I made em’ check out my latest vlog I’ve just uploaded 🤗 Swap the corn chips for baked slices of potatoes! Much more filling, and a healthier/wholesome option 🙌🏼 top it with your fav goodies and dig in! Have you tried potato nachos yet? 🤤
user_32;user_32123.jpg;after an afternoon of riding waves 🌊 💫 salty, sandy, tired, and extremely grateful.  Something I’ve been really working on lately is acceptance. Accepting of things I cannot change, and not allowing those things prevent me from “being”. I am the type of person that loves structure and plans, and if something isn’t going according to plan it causes me stress. I’ve become SO much better over the years. I can more easily go with the flow/roll with the punches. This goes for certain circumstances, but also embracing things I cannot change within myself.  When something arises, I remind myself that it is out of my control in this moment. I can either stress, or brush it off and say “f**k it”. TRUST in timing and trust in yourself. Let the cookie crumble the way it wants, and sort out the pieces as you go. Everything will always work out in due time. Just a lil reminder 💡
user_32;user_32124.jpg;it’s farmer’s market day 🌞 I get so excited to shop at the farmer’s markets! I hate shopping for clothes, but could spend hours (and lots of money) at a market or in a grocery store 🤷🏼‍♀️ who’s with me? 😂 We are stocking up on our fav local, tropical fruits! What’s your fav exotic/tropical fruit? Mine is either Hawaiian papayas or longans right now 🤤
user_32;user_32125.jpg;What keeps you motivated to keep going everyday? 💫 To keep pushing toward achieving your goals? Or simply just to get out of bed? We all have spouts of feeling unmotivated, days where we just want to stay in bed all day. It’s important to honour those times and allow ourselves to slow down. But there’s also a time to push ourselves and get past these feelings. For me, gratitude is so key. Thinking about how lucky I am to live a life full of love, abundance, a life without fear 💛 Realizing that everyday is an opportunity to grow, create, and learn. I am grateful! Other things I like to do to motivate myself is: listen to music, listen to people who inspire me, and get OUT in nature 🌊🌞 detaching myself from social media and grounding myself in nature always puts me in a better mood! What are your tips? I’d love to read them 🙏🏼
user_32;user_32126.jpg;The most perfect bunch of ice cream bananas 🍌 just a reminder of how incredible nature truly is! We are spoiled over here with all the different types of bananas.

user_32;user_32127.jpg;🤙🏼 just high on life over here. This is one of my favourite spots to just come, hangout, and watch the waves.

user_32;user_32128.jpg;Hawaii has to be one of my favourite (if not my absolute favourite) places we’ve lived ⛰💫 The aloha vibes, kind & welcoming community, the BEST quality produce (volcanic soil 🙏🏼), clean air, amazing beaches... the list goes on! Yesterday Kyle and I went to an open house that we found on our drive 🏠 Just to manifest a little more. This property was gorgeous & had all the fruit trees you could imagine! Mature coconut trees, mango tree, lemon, lime, orange, pomegranate, tons of papaya and banana trees, and even an avocado tree 🌱 We vlogged it on the Kyle & Maddie channel! Make sure you’re subscribed to see more of our daily adventures ❤️ Is there a place in the world that would be your DREAM place to own a home?? 👇🏼
user_32;user_32129.jpg;Grateful for the amount of time I’ve got to spend in a bikini this winter 💫🌊 I haven’t experienced a real Canadian winter in 3 years now! We’ve been chasing the summer 🌞 I only miss the winter wonderland around the holidays! A hot Christmas just isn’t the same! Which do you prefer? Summer or winter? 👇🏼

user_32;user_32131.jpg;Feeling so blessed with the abundance of fresh, nutrient rich fruits and veggies here on the island ✨🌺 with a farmer’s market nearly everyday of the week, it makes it virtually impossible for us not to be stocked up the freshest and the best foods 🙏🏼🌱 Ps. new video JUST went live! A rainy day in Hawaii. The farmer’s market, what I ate, & an easy COOKIE recipe 😜🍪
user_32;user_32132.jpg;Eternally grateful for the beauty life brings ✨🌎 Even on the worst of days, we can always find something to be grateful for 🙏🏼 Expressing gratitude has changed my life in so many ways. 👉🏼I am a more positive person 👉🏼I appreciate the small things more deeply 👉🏼I can easily alter my state of mind from somewhere negative to somewhere more positive 👉🏼 I attract more positivity into my life To some, this might sound like total BS. But I promise, if you take it seriously and truly express your gratitude for everything your life has to offer... things start to change!List 3 things you are truly grateful for down below 👇🏼💫
user_32;user_32133.jpg;The best part of my day: deciding what delicious goodies to put in my oatmeal 😻 Lately the combo has been steel cut oats with blueberries, and passion fruit coconut yogurt or lots of almond butter. Yum 🌱 #alwaysoats
user_32;user_32134.jpg;5.5 years of love ❤️🌱and I fall more in love with you everyday. New video is up! What we ate and did in HAWAII 😍🌴
user_32;user_32135.jpg;The hashbrown omelettes have made a comeback 😍Crispy hashbrown stuffed with tofu scramble, mushrooms, greens, salsa, and topped with avocado (then covered in ketchup after the picture was taken) 😅 definitely one of my fav savoury dishes to make! The recipe for these are on my YouTube channel: Maddie Lymburner 🥑
user_32;user_32136.jpg;On our evening walk/run the other night I was chatting with Kyle about how I need to work on managing my stress, and being okay with just being in the moment and not thinking about x,y,z. We were walking past this field down a super quiet road, and this beautiful horse just quickly trotted up to the fence and just stared right at me with her wide eyes. I stopped mid sentence and said “oh my goodness hellooooo” and walked up to the fence. My mood had instantly changed. It’s almost as if she knew. She was there to remind me to just take a breather and focus my energy elsewhere. Animals are always living in the moment, always seeking happiness and love. Even if she just wanted me to feed her some fresh grass😂.... she instantly made my night. Anytime I would stop feeding her and walk further down to find more grass, she would follow and make noises as if she were saying “where are you going?!” Such a sweet, gentle, giant. A moment I’ll never forget.
user_32;user_32137.jpg;Kyle and I always seem to find waffles where ever we are 😍 it’s our fav brunch date food! Kyle has even talked about opening our own Waffle House one day just because we love them so much 😂 do you have a fav brunch/breakfast food?
user_32;user_32138.jpg;a very happy girl in her element: a series 🌊💫 4 mile long beach, warm ocean water, and a beautiful view. What more could a girl ask for? Feeling jet lagged af right now after a full day of travel. An ocean swim and a grocery shop is in order 😍 to see a sneak preview of where we are, check my IG story!
user_32;user_32139.jpg;salty hair, sun kissed skin, ocean air, staring at the palm trees 🌴✨all my worries seem to disappear. I feel grounded, connected to nature 🌎 I can’t stress enough how important it is to ground yourself daily. Barefoot on the earth (if there’s not snow on the ground 😅) , fresh air, just get outside without distractions. About to leave for the airport!Cairns, you’ve been better then I could have ever imagined 💫 I’ll be back! On to the next adventure 🌞
user_32;user_32140.jpg;Relax, and trust the timing of everything 💫 Everything you want is coming. Let the universe guide the way. This is something that resonates with me so much. It doesn’t feel long ago that I felt so completely LOST in life. Right after high school I was a complete mess. I had no idea where my life was headed or what I was meant to be doing in life. But, I trusted my gut and decided to be open to where life would take me. I met the love of my life, started to open my eyes through travelling the world, and began the journey of becoming financially independent through doing what I love (and what I now know is what i was MEANT to do) and helping others 🌱🌎 There is so much I could say, it’s hard to put it into words. 💡 So here’s a reminder if you’re feeling a little stuck in life. Stay passionate, driven, and laser focused on what you WANT. Trust the timing of the universe. It will happen when you’re ready for it to happen. But always, always follow your heart! 💛
user_32;user_32141.jpg;I’ve been eating a bowl like this every single day lately 🌱 I call them “mish mash bowls” because it’s usually just compiled of what we have in the fridge. But the main ingredients stay the same: • salad greens • roasted sweet potatoes in cinnamon • cucumber • avocado • tofu or beans/lentils • beetroot sauerkraut • raw cashew chilli cheese • tahini (and lots of it) I could honestly eat bowls like this every day of my life and never get sick of it 😍🙌🏼
user_32;user_32142.jpg;After spending 1 week here, this place already feels like home ✨🌴 Cairns is added to the top of the list of places I could see myself living long term. I’ve only ever felt this way about 2 other places in the world I’ve visited... can you guess where? 🌎💫 The calmness, the beauty, the quality of food/air/water... this place is pretty perfect! I could definitely see myself with a house up in the rainforest somewhere 🤩 Is there another place in the world that you would live?
user_32;user_32143.jpg;back at it again with another oat bowl ✨ #alwaysoats I’m back to eating cooked oatmeal, and this time I’ve switched it up to STEEL CUT oats! I’m a huge fan of all oatmeal (as you know 😏), but I’ve been enjoying steel cut oats over rolled oats lately. WHY? I feel more satisfied for a longer period of time and I don’t get a “sleepy” feeling after eating them like I was getting with rolled oats! Although rolled oats are still a whole grain, steel cut oats are the “least processed” form of oats available. They take a little longer to cook, but the chewy, and nutty flavour is so worth it 😍  I’ll always switch it up with my choice of oats, but thought I’d share this tidbit of info with you guys in case any of you have been getting this feeling with oats! For 30+ OAT recipes, check out my cookbook “ Always Oats” (link in bio)🙌🏼 Each recipe has the versatility to change up the type of oat depending on what you’re feeling 😍
user_32;user_32144.jpg;never ending empty beaches lined with palm trees 🌴 This is my kind of place ✨ we’ve been soaking up every minute here in Cairns! Getting out in nature as much as possible has been a priority 🌊 Just a few minutes in nature, a few deep breaths of fresh air, can totally change my mood 💫 Today we’re off the rainforest!! Stay tuned for the vlog! ❤️
user_32;user_32145.jpg;I eat food to nourish my body 🍃 I workout to strengthen my body & mind ✨ I make taking care of myself a priority. We only have one body, it’s important to treat it with the upmost love and kindness 💛 I always say to focus on how you FEEL. Do you feel happy? healthy? nourished? strong? The way you feel INSIDE will reflect on the OUTSIDE 💫 we hold too much value in our outer appearances when our INNER feelings are what make us feel whole. How do you FEEL today?👇🏼 And what are you doing today to take care of yourself? 🙏🏼
user_32;user_32146.jpg;Soaking up the beauty that is Queensland 🇦🇺 ✨ breathing in the salty air, toes in the sand, and sun on the skin. • Aus really feels like home to me. I spent 7 months in SA in 2016, broke af, trying to smash out as many YouTube videos as possible. 2 years later, I’m doing YouTube full time and I’m back exploring another beautiful part of this country ❤️ Australia will always have a piece of my heart! Not to mention all the amazing VEGAN options here 🌱 we spent the first 24 hours going to all the food shops reminiscing on all the different food options we used to eat 2 years ago 😂 to see the vlog from our first day and a GROCERY HAUL, check out my latest video! We are filming a taste test video today of all the amazing goodies we’ve yet to try 🤤 Maddie Lymburner on YouTube!
user_32;user_32147.jpg;One of my FAV salad bowls ever🌱 • red rice • leafy greens • sliced beets & cabbage • spiralized carrots & cucumber • roasted pumpkin & broccoli • marinated tempeh • cashews • gluten free garlic toast The POWER HOUSE bowl! So full of nourishment and deliciousness! I used to think pumpkin, beets, and tempeh were really gross before I went vegan 🙊 (I was a suuuuper picky eater). Never in a million years would I have this salad bowl and enjoy it! Now, I can’t get enough! Trying these foods in new ways, and changing my pallet through eating healthier foods has made me LOVE these items! Is there a food that you have learned to love?? 🤔👇🏼
user_32;user_32148.jpg;What most of my days here in Bali have looked like 🌴✨ • Hair up in a bun in the top of my head • Minimal clothing • Some kind of delicious bowl full of oats, fruits, and some @vivolife protein • No makeup • Lots of sunshine! It’s been the life to live this past month! We’ve watched our final Bali sunset, and we are headed to the airport tomorrow ✈️ 🌎 Can you guess where? 😏 New vlog coming tomorrow with all the deets + lots of vegan food (ofc 💁🏼‍♀️) Subscribe to my YouTube channel: Maddie Lymburner so you don’t miss it! 🙌🏼
user_32;user_32149.jpg;I don’t think I’ve eaten out as much as I have this past week or so 😅 but the vegan food here is SO good, and so fresh!! 🌱 Ubud & Canggu are so amazing for vegan food! As convenient and as tasty it is to eat out everyday.. I am so incredibly excited to start cooking and preparing my own meals at home again 😍 Would you rather eat out everyday, and NEVER cook at home? Or cook at home everyday and NEVER eat out? 🤔 I’m curious to see what y’all will choose 😂 can you guess my answer? 👉🏼 Pictured here is jackfruit tacos with tempeh veggie rolls & a carrot, orange, turmeric juice 😍 @theshadyshack
user_32;user_32150.jpg;Take a few minutes to get out into nature today 🌴✨ My mood instantly improves when I: detach from the online world, step outside, breathe fresh air, and ground myself 🍃 I think it’s easy to stay distracted nowadays. We are constantly stimulating ourselves. Most of the time it’s digital stimulation/distraction, and we can easily forget about what’s happening in the “real world”. Just 5-10 minutes is all it takes to detach, and recharge. So, if you haven’t already... this is your reminder to do so ❤️
user_32;user_32151.jpg;This magical creation has definitely got me inspired to eat more chia pudding 😍🦋 • chia seeds soaked in fresh coco milk • banana •papaya • blue spirulina • topped with kiwi and mango balls So simple, yet so delicious (and filling too!) Perfect for these super hot days here in Bali 😋
user_32;user_32152.jpg;We had an amazing day yesterday eating all the best vegan food Canggu has to offer 😋 new vlog on my channel just dropped on my channel! Eating out at every meal here in Bali 🌴 I’ve had many requests to compile a list of all the best vegan places we’ve gone to eat while we’ve been here in Bali, and I’ll be posting that list here on Instagram after our Bali adventures are over (stay tuned) ❤️ one place that we definitely loved was @givecafe ! A not for profit restaurant that donates to different charities to help the people, planet, and animals 🙏🏼🌱 tag some of your fav restaurants in Bali below! We want to try them all 😏🤤
user_32;user_32153.jpg;drinking some liquid sunshine after another beautiful day here in Bali 🌞🍊(orange, carrot, & turmeric). It’s been so, so hot here the past few days and all I’ve been craving is ice cold juices, fruits, and salads 😍 light, fresh, and hydrating! It’s amazing how our bodies adapt to different climates, and crave different things 💦 what’s your fav drink to have on a super hot day? 🥤
user_32;user_32154.jpg;Reminder💡: You cannot control how others perceive your energy. Anything, is filtered through a lens of what that individual is going through at the moment. It has nothing to do with you. Just keep doing you 💫🌞 Canggu sunsets are absolutely devine. Feeling so blessed and soaking it all in! ⭐️ Ps. I just uploaded a new vlog where we explore a bit of Canggu and also answer some of the MOST asked questions we get about TRAVEL! • how do we afford it? • budget travel tips? • how to find places to stay? & much more! Check the link in my story ☺️
user_32;user_32155.jpg;I feel at home when I am closer to nature 🍃I think we can learn so much from it. Nothing is rushed, everything happens for a reason and in due time. Nature teaches us patience, and it also teaches us just how powerful this planet truly is 🌎🙏🏼 My favourite place to immerse myself in nature is either in the mountains or near a body of water ⛰🌊 what’s yours? ✨ Ps. I have a new vlog coming tomorrow! Exploring a bit of Canggu and also answering some of the most asked TRAVEL related questions we get! Lots of good info and tips coming at ya soon! 💫
user_32;user_32156.jpg;valentine’s day brunch with the bubs was a success 😍🌱(we honestly forgot it was valentine’s day, went out to eat and then we were like oh yaaaa... well this is our date I guess 💁🏼‍♀️) V-day is just another beautiful day on this amazing planet 🌎 Vegan French toast, waffles, nachos, and a scoop of coconut ice cream 🤤 @iamveganbabe is doing vegan food RIGHT here in Canggu 👏🏼
user_32;user_32157.jpg;“learn to let vulnerability inspire you and not frighten you. What makes you vulnerable is what makes you human and I think that is a pretty damn beautiful thing”✨ A reminder we all need sometimes. This is something I am truly working on within myself right now. Embracing ME, how I look, how I feel, and not fearing the judgment of others. Not letting the feeing of vulnerability HINDER me, but rather INSPIRE me to share and be more genuine. Embrace your insecurities, show them to the world... it won’t be as scary as you think! Stay tuned for tomorrow’s video 🧡
user_32;user_32158.jpg;A full day of eating and exploring in Bali 💫🌴🥥 new vlog is now live on my YouTube channel: Maddie Lymburner! We visited the Monkey Forrest here in Ubud and we got to hang out with some of my fav creatures in their natural habitat 🐒 it’s crazy how human-like they are! I could have monkeys crawl over me all day. Have you ever seen monkeys up close and personal? 😻
user_32;user_32159.jpg;feeling like the açai queen myself with this beautiful bowl 😻🌸 the perfect post workout meal after a super sweaty gym sesh! Complete with a fresh coconut 🥥... I could get used to this life 🤷🏼‍♀️🌴
user_32;user_32160.jpg;one of my favourite bowls from @sayuri_healing_food 🍃💫 So fresh, so clean, so delicious! Plus, the tempeh here in Bali is on another level 😍 Have you tried tempeh before? The tempeh back at home just doesn’t compare. It’s so fresh here! 🙏🏼
user_32;user_32161.jpg;green juice on white sheets...dangerous 😏🌱Feeling like royalty here with affordable fresh pressed juices and coconut water just down the road! Really starting to feel at home here in Bali 🌞 🍃Green Juice Ingredients: • parsley • mint • celery • cucumber • apple • ginger • lime
user_32;user_32162.jpg;HEALTHY MORNING ROUTINE 🌞 I just uploaded the full version of this video on my YouTube channel (Maddie Lymburner) 💫 Having a routine in the AM that sets you up for a productive day while also doing the best you can for your body and mind is so important 🙏🏼 Here’s some tips: • use natural hygiene products • drink water before anything! Hydrating the Body first thing is so important • take time to BREATHE and STRETCH in the morning! Be present with yourself and take care of your body. • DON’T look at your phone or computer right away. Take time for YOU in the AM... the online world can wait. What are some healthy habits you include in your morning routine?☺️
user_32;user_32163.jpg;One of my go-to meals here in Bali 🌸 it’s too hot for cooked oatmeal, so cold oats it is! • rolled oats (approx. 1 cup) • 3/4 scoop of @vivolife vanilla protein • almond milk (enough to cover) • sliced apple banana • chopped pittaya So simple, but so satisfying! I’m not one to put protein powder in cooked oatmeal, but cold oats... OU girl 💁🏼‍♀️ it’s SO tasty and so creamy! Would highly recommend trying it out, especially with @vivolife because it’s the best tasting protein out there 😏 (new customers can save $ by using my code MADDIE10... otherwise you can support your girl by going through my link in my YouTube videos) 💗
user_32;user_32164.jpg;trust the process, let go of resistance, and enjoy the journey 💫 you’ll end up in places you never dreamed you could. Really feeling a mass amount of gratitude for this life. Sometimes it’s so overwhelming and I struggle to put it into words. Practicing gratitude, and being laser focused on my passions has changed my life in so many ways. If you need a sign to DO something for you today, this is it. Start that project, take the plunge, book that ticket... whatever it is. If it’s your passion and you feel it in your bones that this is what/where you’re supposed to do/be... then do it! Life’s too short to hesitate🙏🏼
user_32;user_32165.jpg;I’m normally a cooked food kind of gal, but I could get used to this gourmet raw vegan stuff 🤤🥬 the nacho plate has been our fav from @alchemybali so far! New video featuring this epic spread will be up soon (as soon as it uploads #balilife) it’s a really good one, so make sure you’re subscribed on YouTube and have got your notifications on ❤️ Are you a raw food or cooked food kind of person? 🤔
user_32;user_32166.jpg;Beautiful pink sunsets in Cape Town are something I will never forget 🌅⛰ if there is a place in the world that is calling your name, make a point to go there at least once in your life 🌎 This world is so beautiful and we must explore it and witness the beauty it holds while we can 💫 Where is one place in the world that you are DYING to go to? And why? ✈️
user_32;user_32167.jpg;Most definitely one of the best açai bowls I’ve ever had 💫😍 the homemade whipped cream was so creamy, i had to double check that it was vegan 🌱😅 Bali is definitely a vegan heaven! So many options here and the fresh produce is just incredible!
user_32;user_32168.jpg;Exactly what I needed after 24 hours of sitting on a plane & no sleep✈️🌴 (hence the massive bags under my eyes 😂) This was taken probably 15 minutes after we arrived here in Bali. I threw down my suitcase, jumped into my bikini, and immediately dived into the pool. Sipping on a fresh coconut that we were greeted with by our host 🥥❤️ This place is paradise, and I feel so unbelievably grateful to be here 🙏🏼 Bring on all the vegan foooooood 😍
user_32;user_32169.jpg;Cape Town: You are truly an amazing place 💫⛰ thank you for all the unforgettable memories! Cape Town was on the top of my bucket list for a few years now. I had a weird calling to go there. After spending 3 months, leaving felt like we were leaving home 🏡 Cape Town is a place we will visit again, and again and we can’t wait to come back 💛 We made it to Bali about 24 hours ago! So happy to be here. New video coming in the morning as the upload speed is sloooow here 🌴🥥😅
user_32;user_32170.jpg;1 chai latte with soy milk, please ☕️🌱 I definitely prefer soy (soya?? which one is it) in my lattes 🤤 but almond milk is a close second... coconut milk is pretty good too 🤷🏼‍♀️ So many dang dairy free options to choose from! Ps. I just uploaded a NEW video on my channel! What I eat PRE & POST workout with some HIGH PROTEIN meals 💪🏼 we be makin’ those GAINS my friends! So much so that these jeans are almost too small for the booty now 👏🏼 #progress
user_32;user_32171.jpg;Cherishing these last few days in this magical place 💫⛰ Cape Town has stolen a piece of my heart forever 🔐💛 This was taken on Chapman’s Peak Drive, one of the most beautiful roads I have ever been on. My mind was truly blown 🤯 It’s shown in my latest video on my channel... if ya haven’t seen it check it out! 🐧🍩
user_32;user_32172.jpg;DROOL 🤤 These were honestly some of the best vegan donuts we’ve ever had 🍩 Which one would you choose?? The Oreo and the lemon poppyseed were my fav 😍 Huge shoutout to @rumsys.noose here in Cape Town 🙌🏼🌱 who says ya can’t have it all and be vegan too? 🤷🏼‍♀️
user_32;user_32173.jpg;Just trying to blend in with my new friends 🐧❤️ today was absolutely a dream! We were the only people on a beach full of penguins 💫 I had never seen a penguin in real life before until today. Being able to completely immerse ourselves in their habitat was so, so cool. And yes, there are penguins in South Africa 🇿🇦They migrated from the Antarctic! Ps. I never realized how CUTE penguins are. They way they waddle, shake their tails, and swim super fast under water 😩😩❤️ I can’t.
user_32;user_32174.jpg;apple cinnamon oat granola bowl 🥣🍎 • rolled oats cooked in half almond milk, half water • fruit and nut granola • sliced fresh apples • spoonful of crunchy PB • drizzle of coconut yogurt & after this photo I added some more almond milk and this combo was AMAZING 😍 tasted like freaking apple crisp!!! This is why I love oatmeal so much. There are soooo many ways you can dress it up and change the flavours. I swear I eat more than just oatmeal... but I eat oats everyday 🤷🏼‍♀️🌱
user_32;user_32175.jpg;the perfect place to sit and just “be” 💫🌊 be present in the moment, be away from constant distractions, be grateful... just be! This is a quote I came across today in an article I was reading: “when you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself” ✨ it really struck me & I wanted to share. Hope you all are having an amazing day, and your bellies are full of delicious vegan food 💛 preset by the lovely: @joliejanine
user_32;user_32176.jpg;if ya need me, you can find me here 🌞🌊 (or behind my computer... usually behind my computer 💻😂). Being by the ocean, out in nature is one of my favourite places to be. I think it is so important that we take some time everyday to spend a few minutes outside! Most of us are stuck inside, at a desk, sitting down, breathing stagnant air. We need to get outside, get some sunshine (if you can), and breathe some fresh air! It instantly changes me mood and helps my mental health so much 🙌🏼
user_32;user_32177.jpg;peaches and cream oatmeal 🧡 the stone fruit here is on another level! So sweet and so juicy 🍑 Plus the best coconut yogurt in the world... this combo never disappoints 🤤 I think I am going to have to start making my own coconut yogurt after we leave, because nothing else I have ever bought compares to this stuff! Very few ingredients (no sugar) and so thick (almost like a Greek yogurt texture) 😍 I’ve also been loving making creamier oats like this by giving my rolled oats a few pulses in the nutribullet! So good! Do you like your oatmeal like porridge or thicker like rolled oats? 🥣
user_32;user_32178.jpg;We met just over 5 years ago. I worked as a cashier in a small health food shop and Kyle had just moved into town. He was a regular customer at the store. My coworkers would call me to the cash when they saw him shopping, just so I could “check him out” 😏 because they knew I thought he was super dreamy. I was way too shy to ever say a word to him, and would always get super flustered at the register when scanning his groceries. LITTLE DID I KNOW... he thought I was cute too 😉 He figured out the days I worked, and would always do his shopping then. One day he waited for all the customers in the store to leave so he would have as much time as possible to talk to me at the cash. He asked me out, we went on a date, and he told me over dinner (while I was eating chicken 😩) that he hadn’t eaten meat in two weeks and all about the “power of plant foods”. First date went exceptionally well 💫 We hung out some more, and long story short... here we are. We went vegan together, travelled together, started YouTube... and now we have the privilege of helping others see the light, just as we did 5 years ago ✨ I love our story. I love how committed we are. Not just to each other, but also to helping people live a healthier & happier lifestyle 🌱 it’s a dream come true 💫
user_32;user_32179.jpg;Beauty is everywhere you look ✨especially here in Cape Town 😏 Taking more time out of my day to be present. Purely living in the moment. I’ve become more appreciative of the NOW and my surroundings. Also, we reached 300k on YouTube yesterday 😮😭🎉So incredibly grateful for the community of wonderful people who choose to support me online. My heart just keeps growing, and growing ❤️ This still feels like the very beginning!
user_32;user_32180.jpg;no place I’d rather be 💫🌊 Life is short. Take time today to truly appreciate the people in your life that you love. Tell them you love them, do a fun activity together, give thanks for the joy they’ve brought you, or simply just “be” together 💛 friends, family, loved ones, (even your fur babies 🐾) it’s so important. And if no one has told you today... I LOVE YOU, you are beautiful ❤️ Ps. New video is going live on my channel soon! What I eat + calories,macro/micro nutrients 😬
user_32;user_32181.jpg;oatmeal for 2 👫💛 I seriously could not live without my oatmeal! 🥣 Oats: 👉🏼 Are a whole grain that humans started to eat thousands of years ago. 👉🏼 Are rich in carbohydrates & fibre (more importantly the soluble fibre beta-glucan) 👉🏼 Soluble fibre helps to lower LDL & total cholesterol levels, blood sugar stabilization, and increases your feeling of fullness! 👉🏼 Are loaded with vitamins, minerals, & antioxidants. Topped with my fav fruit, sometimes nut butter or coco yogurt... it’s the perfect meal! 😻 I even made a cookbook full of all my favourite oat-y recipes 😏 #alwaysoats
user_32;user_32182.jpg;you are my person 💫💛 It’s only rained a few times since we’ve been in Cape Town, including during this shoot 🌦 it made for some amazing photos though. Thank you @patrickpannenbergweddings for capturing so many beautiful moments! There are many more to come 😻
user_32;user_32183.jpg;who else loves a good smoothie bowl? 🙋🏼‍♀️✨ bananas & pittaya topped with kiwi, peaches, coconut, buckwheat, & passionfruit 😻 the perfect post workout meal after a gym sesh on a hot day 🌞
user_32;user_32184.jpg;I am in charge of how I feel, and today I am choosing happiness ✨💫 Always seek positivity. Life is truly amazing when you choose to spread love & kindness. Positivity will always win 💛
user_32;user_32185.jpg;another 10 MIN MEAL 💫 canned vegetable soup, with added extra kidney beans (1/2 can), steamed kale, topped with avocado, steamed tender stem broccoli & sliced ciabatta on the side. Incredibly filling, high in protein, and so delicious 😜 I love making my meals from scratch, but realistically there are many days where I just need a quick & on the go meal. Canned veggie soup (or meal prepped soup) is a saviour for us. Add extra beans, eat it with potatoes, rice, or quinoa. It’s so versatile, healthy, and most importantly QUICK! ⚡️So important to have an arsenal of quick, but healthy meals in your repertoire so you don’t feel stuck (and then end up eating crappy foods that don’t make you feel your best)!
user_32;user_32186.jpg;another year come and gone 💫 2018, you were one heck of a ride. Definitely one of the most life changing years of my life thus far. I am so ready for what 2019 has to bring my way ✨ it’s going to be a huge year, I can already see it. Take some time today to reflect on how much has changed this past year, how much you’ve grown as a person, use that fire to catapult you into 2019 with the most positive outlook. What is one thing you learned in 2018? And one thing you are going to work on in 2019? 2018: I learned the value of patience & a heck of a lot about myself. 2019: my motto will be “don’t think, just DO” 🌟
user_32;user_32187.jpg;and the oatmeal, fruit, coconut yogurt obsession continues 😻 Pineapple, peaches, mango, strawberries, coco yogurt, topped with a squeeze of fresh passion fruit 🙏🏼 today we got 36 passion fruits for 10$... that would cost us over 70$ at home. We are happy campers over here! Summer in South Africa is treating us well 🔥
user_32;user_32188.jpg;when he says “let’s go get milkshakes for breakfast” ... you know he’s a keeper 😜 today I had a milkshake, a burger, and fries for breakfast. Am I upset about it? Absolutely NOT 😍 Most days I eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast, but some days I eat burgers and milkshakes 💁🏼‍♀️ All about that healthy balance my friends!
user_32;user_32189.jpg;Feeling so grateful this holiday season 🙌🏼 for this beautiful life, my family, old friends, new friends I’ve met this year, and of course this amazing community of humans here online that are here showing love and support every day ❤️ I hope you all are having an awesome holiday spending time with loved ones and eating all the delicious vegan food 😍 Christmas in the warm weather didn’t really feel like Christmas to this Canadian girl 😜 Do you spend Christmas in the sunshine 🌞 or in the snow?❄️
user_32;user_32190.jpg;Christmas Eve veggie pizza 🍕🌱 A quick 10 min meal! Many people struggle with quick and easy meal ideas on a plant based diet. I love to cook and come up with new and exciting recipes, but most of the time I’m super busy and need something quick! This is just a ready made vegan pizza base that cooks in 10 mins, and then I chopped up some mushrooms, red bell pepper, kale, and topped it with some avocado 🥑 (yes I put avo on my pizza AND my pasta... don’t @ me 💁🏼‍♀️). We used to have a tradition where we would order Chinese takeout every Christmas Eve... do you have any Christmas Eve traditions??
user_32;user_32191.jpg;Farmer’s Market day is my favourite day of the week 🥕🍌🥦 the local produce is always so fresh and tastes so much better than anything you can buy in the stores! It’s also totally waste free (yay for no unnecessary plastic ♻️) Do you have a farmer’s market near you? So important to support them if you do 🙌🏼❤️
user_32;user_32192.jpg;we are more than ready to take on 2019 💫 so thankful I have a partner that is constantly motivated, willing to learn new skills, and on the same page as me about reaching our goals. Big things are coming this year and we’re so excited ❤️ do you have a goal for 2019?? 👇🏼
user_32;user_32193.jpg;Watermelon bikini & eating a banana on the beach🍌🍉 how much more vegan can I get 😂 Watermelon or banana? You can only pick one for the rest of your life 👇🏼 I think I would pick bananas only because I use bananas in so many things! Ps. A new video is up! What @kylemfraser and I eat in a day + our epic vegan date night!! ❤️ ALSO, I am doing a HOLIDAY SALE on my ebooks! Get them 50% off now until Dec. 27th 🎁LINK IN MY BIO!
user_32;user_32194.jpg;sunsets here are just magical 💫🌞 Travelling has opened my eyes in so many different ways. I am so much more appreciative of this planet and the beauty it holds. How it’s able to house all of us humans in so many diverse ecosystems. But also how different, yet so similar each place is. We are all brothers and sisters 👫 and we all call this planet home 🌎 I am so grateful to experience this life and share it with so many wonderful individuals! ❤️ Where have you travelled to in your life? And what has it taught you? 👇🏼 Very interested to know!
user_32;user_32195.jpg;I choose to eat in abundance ✨🌞 that is the pure beauty of a plant-based diet 🌱 not only do I eat in abundance, but I’m eating an abundance of mineral and nutrient rich foods that nourish the body. Plant foods are naturally higher in fibre and lower in caloric density, meaning we must eat more volume of food to meet our caloric needs. To succeed on this lifestyle and make this way of eating sustainable for yourself, you must eat in abundance... you must fulfill your caloric needs. Stay away from the fad diets and focus on what nature has provided us with! Whole plant foods: fruits, veg, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. Eat a variety & eat enough 🙌🏼🌱 Create a lifestyle of abundance for yourself ❤️
user_32;user_32196.jpg;I’m digging the barefoot mountain lifestyle 🌞⛰ Yesterday we went up Table Mountain, one of the 7 natural wonders of the world 🌎✨ absolutely breathtaking! Being in spots like this really grounding for me. It puts things into perspective and makes me see the bigger picture (literally)😅 The vlog from yesterday just went live on my channel!

user_32;user_32197.jpg;When you make your oatmeal bowls look like smoothie bowls 😻✨ after I took this photo I dumped a mountain of coconut yogurt on it (of course 🤷🏼‍♀️). Two foods I couldn’t live without are oats and fruit! What are yours? 👇🏼 Ps. Those hairy arms are @kylemfraser ‘s 😉 he loves oat and fruit just as much as I do ❤️ #alwaysoats
user_32;user_32198.jpg;windy sunset adventures ✨⛰ if you’re ever having a “bad day” or a day where you’re just not feeling so good, there’s 2 things that will ALWAYS change my mood around. One: getting out in NATURE ⛰🌞🌊 even if it’s just a quick stroll. Nature is so grounding. Breathing in fresh air, listening to the sounds of the waves or the trees blowing in the wind. I’m instantly in a better mood when I’m in the forest, hiking a mountain, or by the ocean ❤️ Two: SWEATING 💦 Some days I can feel like total crap, and after a quick 10-20 min sweat sesh (like an at home workout from my MadFit YT channel 😏) I will feel COMPLETELY different. Getting the lymphatic system pumping and those endorphins going instantly changes the way I’m feeling 💫 is there anything you do to improve your mood or how you’re feeling on “bad days”? 👇🏼
