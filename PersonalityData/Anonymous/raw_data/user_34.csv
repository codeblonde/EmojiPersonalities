Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, remove the pot from heat and add in the raw cashews. Allow the cashews to soak until softened, about 20-30 minutes. Drain the cashews.⁣ 2. Add all of the ingredients for the orange creamsicles into a high speed blender and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.⁣ 3. Evenly distribute the mixture into 10 popsicle molds. Tap the popsicle molds onto the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles. Place the popsicles into the freezer and allow them to set until solid, ideally overnight.⁣ 4. To remove the popsicles from the mold, submerge the mold into a bowl of warm (not hot) water for about 30-40 seconds (longer if necessary depending on the warmth of the water). Gently wiggle the popsicles out of the mold to prevent them from cracking.⁣ Enjoy!⁣ ⁣ #user_34 #orangecreamsicle #summerecipes #veganorangecreamsicle #cashewcream #veganrecipes #popsicles

user_34;user_345.jpg;Before we return to posting our regular content, we wanted to share what we will be doing and changing moving forward not only in our business but also in our daily lives. ⁣This past week has really opened our eyes to how much more we could and should be doing with our positions and platforms through Sweet Simple Vegan and Conscious Chris. ⁣ We are disappointed that it took us this long to show up, put in the work, uplift the Black community and actively fight for a change, and moving forward we are committed being better allies and to being anti-racist. ⁣ ⁣ (The images used are from two Black creators that you should definitely check out - The first is from graphic designer @_stormae. The second image and quote are from author @lalahdelia and her book “Vibrate Higher Daily: Live Your Power”) ⁣ ⁣ 1. Each month we will be donating a portion of our income from our ad revenue and sponsored content to organizations supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, BIPOC and other environmental and social causes that we resonate with. This month we will be donating to @blackresiliencefund. ⁣ 2. We will continue to highlight and support BIPOC content creators and businesses on our platform. We are still brainstorming how we can do this most effectively for these individuals and brands, so if you have any ideas you would like to share, feel free to send us a direct message here on Instagram, we would love your input. ⁣ 3. All brand partnerships moving forward will be more thoroughly vetted to ensure they are in line with our sentiments. We admit that we were not as in depth about this in the past as we should have been and moving forward this will be improved.⁣ 4. Most importantly, we will continue to do the work— we will continue to educate ourselves, have conversations, speak up when we see or hear something that is wrong, and actively work to fight against racism and social injustice. ⁣ ⁣ We know that change needs to happen but we also know that it will not happen overnight, so we will always do our best and we will continue to show up. Although we are just 2 people, we know that our actions and changes can make a difference, and yours will too.⁣ ⁣ Best,⁣ Jasmine & Chris
user_34;user_346.jpg;We will not be posting our regularly scheduled content this week in order to #amplifymelanatedvoices. ⁣ ⁣ It is important that we stand as allies and instead use our platforms to share, amplify, and support the voices and experiences of BIPOC.⁣ ⁣ We will continue to share resources on our Instagram pages as well as continue to educate ourselves on the matter.⁣ ⁣ @jessicawilson.msrd and @blackandembodied are hosting the #amplifymelanatedvoices movement if you'd like to join in and amplify the voices of BIPOC. ⁣ ⁣ Here is a list of black content creators that you can support right now: ⁣ - @moemotivate⁣ - @Iamtabithabrown⁣ - @genesisbutler_⁣ - @sweetpotatosoul⁣ - @whatsgoodberto⁣ - @badassvegan⁣ - @the_blackveganchick⁣ - @torre.washington⁣ - @withcarrington⁣ - @theplantbasedmd⁣ - @officialgreymusic⁣ - @shinewithplants⁣ - @kindred.vegan.souls⁣ - @queenofgreen⁣ - @charlie_fyffe ⁣ ⁣ Please feel free to comment more content creators and business that we can support down below! ❤️⁣ ⁣ We also put together an email with this list of these content creators to support, links to additional resources and information + ways that you can take action at https://bit.ly/SSV-BLM-Resources (can be accessed via the link in my bio).

user_34;user_347.jpg;We all have voices, so let’s use them to speak up for what is right— your silence is louder than you think.⁣ ⁣ #blacklivesmatter⁣ ⁣ It’s been hard for me to gather my thoughts and figure out what is the “right” thing to say, but it’s so much more important for me to say something than to say nothing at all. If I don’t say or do everything perfectly, I will learn and do better for the next time. ⁣ ⁣ What has been happening is NOT new and is NOT okay. WE NEED BE BETTER, WE NEED TO DO BETTER. We need to start learning, listening, sharing and doing our part in fighting against racism. We need to hold our friends and family accountable, we need to have more uncomfortable conversations with others about racism (we also need to learn WHY these conversations may make us uncomfortable) and we need to reflect on our past actions and biases. We need to take the time and put in the effort to educate ourselves and learn how we can make a change and SAVE the lives of others. #GeorgeFloyd, #AhmaudArbery, #BreonnaTaylor, and so many more just this YEAR did not deserve to die.

Add more tahini dressing as needed or desired. Set aside.⁣ 3. Vegetables: Preheat your grill on medium heat for 10 minutes. We didn’t use oil but you can oil it if you’d like. Alternatively you can preheat an oiled grill pan on high. Add the vegetables and cook, turning often, until they are charred to your liking, about 10-20 minutes depending on the grill and vegetables. Some vegetables will cook faster than others depending on their size and variety.⁣ ⁣ (Continued in comments below)⁣ ⁣ https://user_34.com/2020/05/grilled-vegetable-salad-chickpeas-tahini-dressing/⁣ #user_34 #grillrecipe #grilledsalad #grilledvegetables #vegangrillrecipes

user_34;user_3415.jpg;Meet LOUIE 🐶❤️ For those who may have missed it, our family recently grew by 1 🐶 Louie is a 4(ish) year old itty bitty chihuahua mix that we adopted from @agavedogsrescue about 2 weeks ago 💕 Although our relationship with him is still new, I already love him with all of my heart and so do Chris and Berry 😭⁣ ⁣ We don’t know too much about his background, but what we do know is that he was surrendered by his owner in Fresno this past February, and then Agave rescued him from that (kill) shelter in March. He is still shy and still unsure of us at times, but he has grown SO much since we adopted him and is such a love bug. We are so happy to have given him a new chance at life and our goal is to give him the best life ever because he deserves it 😭 ⁣ If you didn’t know, about 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. shelters every year— about 3.3 million dogs and 3.2 million cats. Roughly half of the animals who enter shelters—many of them healthy, young, and adoptable—end up euthanized because there are simply too many animals and not enough worthy adoptive homes 🙁 A lot of these animals don’t get the chance at life because so many people choose to go through breeders/pet stores instead. Why is the life of a pure bred more valuable than a shelter dog? It’s not. When you choose to buy an animal, you also choose not to help the animals already in need and in turn, they will probably lose their life because of the lack of adoptions 💔⁣ ⁣ If you’re looking to bring a new friend into your life, PLEASE adopt instead of going through breeders, pet stores, etc. You will help break the cycle of pet overpopulation, you of course will SAVE a life and you will have a new bff — it’s a win win win in my book 📚 ⁣ ⁣ PS — my “RESCUE is my favorite breed” tee is from @rebl.vegan. They’re a small family owned vegan clothing brand owned by some of my friends in Colorado and you should definitely check them out! 🙏🏼⁣ ⁣ PPS— @theveganview did an episode with @maedayrescue and it’s very helpful if you want to learn more about why you should adopt!

Line an 8×4-inch bread pan with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350°F.⁣ 2. In a large bowl, add in all of the wet ingredients and mix until uniform. Set aside for 5 minutes so that the flaxseed meal can thicken.⁣ 3. Add in all of the dry ingredients except for the walnuts until uniform. Fold in the walnuts until combined.⁣ 4. Transfer the batter into the lined bread pan using a spatula, and then smooth out the top of the batter to make sure that it is equally distributed in the pan.⁣ 5. Take your last banana and slice it vertically. Place the banana halves, cut side up, onto the batter, gently pressing them in.⁣ 6. If you would like, you can lightly sprinkle the banana bread with additional coconut sugar before placing it into the oven. This allows for additional caramelization and makes the bananas even prettier when baked!⁣ 7. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick runs clean.⁣ 8. Remove the banana bread from the oven and allow it to cool for 15 minutes.⁣ 9. Slice the banana bread as desired (we cut ours into 12) and enjoy!⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ are in the comments! ⁣ ⁣ #vegan #user_34 #bananabread #veganrecipe #feedfeed #feedfeedvegan #feedfeedbaking
user_34;user_3420.jpg;#ad | VEGAN FILIPINO BEEF STEAK AKA BISTEK TAGALOG 😛🇵🇭 ⁣ ⁣ Something that my mom and I have been doing lately is having weekly facetime cooking sessions 😍 We plan a recipe then make and eat it together on our call as we would in person— it’s a lot of fun and really makes me feel at home! Since we can’t be together, this is the next best thing 😊⁣ ⁣ I partnered up with @samsunghomeappliances for Mother’s Day this year to put together a special recipe, and I thought what better recipe to share than one of my mom’s favorites, Filipino Beef Steak aka Bistek Tagalog. ⁣ ⁣ Since my mom and I are both vegan, our recipe traditions have shifted a bit in the sense that we no longer eat animal products, but that doesn’t mean that we are no longer able to eat Filipino food! It has been a project of ours to veganize as many recipes as we can, and it has also been such a fun project for the two of us to do together.⁣ ⁣ This was one of the most interesting recipe that we have put together since it was all done digitally but it was also a great way for us to step outside of the box. The full recipe is available on our blog, link will be in my bio! ❤️⁣ ⁣ #samsunghomeappliances #mothersday #veganfilipino #veganbistek #filipinorecipes #user_34 #vegan https://user_34.com/2020/05/vegan-filipino-beef-steak/

user_34;user_3428.jpg;Cooking used to be one of my least favorite activities 🤷🏽‍♀️😬⁣ ⁣ Even boxed cake/brownie mixes stressed me out and I often messed those up 🤣 boxed mac and cheese and ramen though, those were my specialties 🍜 ⁣ After going vegan, I was pretty much left to fend for myself. No one else in my family was vegan or even vegetarian, and my mom was confused on what I could eat. There was A LOT of trial and error to start...and let’s just say a lot of questionable recipes that I won’t be showcasing here on sweet simple vegan haha.⁣ ⁣ Slowly but surely, I started to find my way around the kitchen and cooking soon became something that I was actually excited about. My free time was quickly taken up by searching for new recipes and cooking tips, trying to improve my skills everyday.⁣ ⁣ Stepping outside of my comfort zone, into a completely new territory for me was both invigorating and terrifying. Especially since I wanted to encourage those around me to eat vegan with me! I felt the pressure to make impressive meals but also keep it easy enough for myself to not f up 😅⁣ ⁣ What was once one of the most daunting tasks for me quickly became one of my favorite activities. It is my way to destress, my happy place 🙃⁣ ⁣ Have any of you also struggled with cooking?⁣ #vegan #user_34

user_34;user_3430.jpg;EDIBLE COOKIE DOUGH BITES 😍 Tag a friend you want to make these with! 🙏🏼 they’re easy, vegan, gluten-free and just 5-ingredients! So many of you have been recreating these and I’m so happy to see that you’re enjoying them 😍 The full recipe is below and also on our blog, link in my bio! ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1/4 cup maple syrup, or liquid sweetener of your choice⁣ * 1/4 cup nut or seed butter⁣ * 1 tsp vanilla extract⁣ * 1 tsp water⁣ * Optional: 1/4 tsp salt⁣ * 1 cup oat flour (see notes)⁣ * 1 1/2 tbsp vegan chocolate chips⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. In a large bowl, add the maple syrup, nut or seed butter, vanilla, water and optional salt. Mix until uniform.⁣ 2. Add the oat flour and mix until well combined, then using clean hands, “knead” the dough together to be sure it all mixes through. If the dough seems a bit too wet, you can add additional oat flour, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until it reaches a cookie dough like consistency.⁣ 3. Add in the vegan chocolate chips and mix through with your hands.⁣ 4. Using a 1-tablespoon sized cookie scooper (or a regular tablespoon or even just with your hands), scoop out the dough and roll it into a ball. Continue until you have rolled out all of the dough– we formed 8.⁣ 5. Store in an airtight container for about 5 days, although these are best enjoyed the day of as they will dry out as they sit.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ - If you have rolled oats on hand, you can make your own oat flour. Place 1 cup in a high speed blender and blend until fine.⁣ - The nut or seed butter that is used will effect the flavor of the cookie dough. We like to use cashew butter or peanut butter.⁣ - While we prefer the flavor of maple syrup, you can use any liquid sweetener you have on hand.⁣ - You can also roughly chop your favorite chocolate bar in place of the chips.⁣ - If the nut or seed butter that you are using is salted, keep that in mind before salting the dough. We would add half of the amount of salt to 1/8 teaspoon.⁣ ⁣ #5ingredient #pantryrecipe #cookiedough #vegancookies https://user_34.com/2020/04/edible-cookie-dough/⁣

user_34;user_3434.jpg;PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM “STEAKS” 😍🍄Tender, juicy, and melt-in-your-mouth goood 🔥 This is easy and gluten-free entree is perfect for date nights at home and it can be ready in less than an hour🙏🏼⁣ ⁣ The recipe is below and you can also find the saved step by step tutorial on my story highlights ❤️⁣ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 6 large portobello mushrooms⁣ * 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar⁣ * 1/4 cup tamari (or soy sauce if not gluten-free)⁣ * 2 tablespoons olive oil⁣ * 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce⁣ * 1 teaspoon liquid smoke⁣ * 1/2–1 teaspoon black pepper (depending on how pepper-y you would like it)⁣ * 1 teaspoon garlic powder⁣ * 1 teaspoon onion powder⁣ * 2 sprigs fresh thyme, stems removed and finely chopped⁣ * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. De-stem each portobello mushroom, leaving just the caps. Discard, compost or save the stems for homemade vegetable broth. Set mushroom caps aside.⁣ 2. In a large-sized wide and shallow dish, combine all of the ingredients except for the mushrooms. Whisk together until fully combined.⁣ 3. Add in the portobello mushroom caps to the marinade and flip them back and forth a few times for fully coat both sides. If needed, use a spoon to pour the marinade over the mushrooms. Allow the mushrooms to marinate for at least 15-30 minutes, the longer the better!⁣ 4. Once the mushrooms have marinated, heat a grill or a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once warmed, add the portobello mushrooms along with any remaining marinade* and cook on each side for 4-5 minutes, or until softened and a deep golden brown. Gently flip the mushrooms as they will be fragile!⁣ 5. Serve warm with sides of choice. This goes well with mashed potatoes or our fall rice pilaf!⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * We grilled asparagus to serve alongside our portobello mushroom steaks. Instead of pouring the remaining marinade in with the mushrooms, we saved it and used it to marinate the asparagus. It turned out delicious and is highly recommended!⁣ ⁣ #vegan #user_34 #stayhome #mushroomsteaks #vegansteaks #glutenfreevegan https://user_34.com/2018/11/vegan-portobello-mushroom-steaks/

His mom was so malnourished that she wasn’t producing milk, and if the rescue didn’t come when they did they probably wouldn’t have made it 😭😭 Now more than ever, rescues and shelters need our support— if you have the ability to foster or even adopt an animal, you can help save a life!

user_34;user_3440.jpg;EASY 5-INGREDIENT VEGGIE BURGERS ❤️ I thought that this recipe would be helpful right about now as it uses simple ingredients that you may already have in your home! The full recipe is below and a step by step is in my stories, plus you can also check it out on our blog via the link in my bio 😍⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Ingredients⁣⁣ * 1 (15oz.) can of black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1 3/4 cups)⁣ (or beans of choice—see notes)⁣ * 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon gluten-free rolled oats⁣⁣ * 1 large shallot, roughly chopped (or 1/2 medium onion)⁣⁣ * 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped⁣⁣ * 1/2 tablespoon old bay seasoning⁣ (or seasoning blend of choice— see notes)⁣ * Black pepper, to taste⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Instructions⁣⁣ 1. In the bowl of a food processor, add in all of the ingredients and process for 15 to 20 seconds, or until the mixture begins to come together, scraping the sides as needed. Scrape all of the mixture into a small bowl and place the bowl into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set.⁣⁣ 2. Preheat oven to 400°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and set aside.⁣⁣ 3. Remove the bowl from the fridge. Scoop out 1/2 cup sized scoops from the mixture and using wet hands, form the mixture into patties. We made 3 patties total. Place the patties onto the prepared baking sheet and place them into the oven for 15 minutes. Flip the patties over and then bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the patties are browned and feel solid.⁣⁣ ⁣ Notes:⁣ •If you would like to speed up the cooking process, you can also cook these burgers on a pan. For this. we suggest heating about 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cooking the patties on each side until browned, about 5 minutes per side.⁣ •We have tried this recipe with cannellini beans, red beans and pinto beans and all have worked well!⁣ •If you do not have Old bay, feel free to use a seasoning blend of your choice -- just be sure to add salt the blend does not have any. ⁣ ⁣ ⁣ #vegan⁣ #socialdistancing #quaratinerecipes #wfh #easyrecipe #5ingredient #user_34 ⁣ ⁣⁣ https://user_34.com/2019/06/5-ingredient-veggie-burgers/#tasty-recipes-23205

I promise you that you will come up with something, even with the most random ingredients!⁣ ❤️⁣ ⁣⁣ Let me know what random ingredients you have to use up + what recipes you came up with!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ #ad #wyhw #whatyouhavewednesday #user_34 #reducewaste #foodwaste ⁣
user_34;user_3444.jpg;*5 Tips For Staying Productive While Working From Home * ⁣ ⁣ Sometimes it can be tough to get into the zone when working remotely so I thought that these tips might be helpful, especially during this time! ❤️ ⁣ ⁣ 1. Create a Dedicated Workspace - Before we moved into our new home, the space we were living in did not have a dedicated workspace. This lead to us working in bed, in the kitchen, or living room, and it was far from ideal. Once we created a dedicated work space, our efficiency and focus shifted and we were able to become more productive with our work.⁣ ⁣ 2. Separate Yourself From Your Phone – This comes as no surprise, but our phones are easily the biggest distraction we have. We’ve been doing our best to distance ourselves as much as possible from our phones during working hours, and it has made an enormous difference in our productivity 🙏🏼 Here are a few different methods of reduce screen time: put your phone on airplane mode, turn off notifications, or leave your phone in another room.⁣ ⁣ 3. Take Breaks – We sometimes get so lost in what we are doing that we forget to take breaks. We have found that we are usually more creative and productive when we take small 10-15 minute breaks every two hours or so. These usually come in the form of getting more matcha/coffee, taking a walk outside, stretching, or playing with Berry.⁣ ⁣ 4. Be Aware of Your Posture – I wouldn’t be able to count how many times we started our workdays in bed or on the couch. While it may seem comfortable at first, after an hour or two, we find ourselves slouching, distracted, or even asleep. When we became more aware of our posture, we noticed such a difference in our focus and attention to the task at hand. To l help with posture, we also have a standing tabletop desk which is great to break up the monotony of sitting all day. (I realize that this photo is not the best example haha but we were just posing for the photo 😂)⁣ ⁣ 5. Keep it Minimal – When our office or workspace is clean and decluttered, it is so much easier to focus and be creative. Plus, a clean workspace helps us start the day with a clear mind and inspires us to get things done ✅ ⁣
user_34;user_3445.jpg;VEGAN IRISH SODA BREAD! 🍞 An easy to make & foolproof vegan recipe that is ready in under an hour and requires just 10 simple ingredients! Plus the beauty of this bread is that no yeast is required 🙏🏼 Recipe is below and also linked in my bio! ⁣ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk⁣ * 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar⁣ * 3 1/2–4 cups bread flour⁣ * 1 cup raisins⁣ * ½ cup brown sugar⁣ * 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal⁣ * 1 tablespoon cornstarch⁣ * 2 teaspoons baking soda⁣ * 1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt⁣ * 1/4 cup vegan butter, melted⁣ * 1 tablespoon caraway seeds (optional)⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.⁣ 2. In a small bowl, combine the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine and set aside for 10 minutes. The almond milk will curdle and this will form a vegan buttermilk.⁣ 3. In a large bowl, mix together 3 1/2 cups of bread flour, raisins, brown sugar, flaxseed meal, cornstarch, baking soda, salt and caraway seeds. Mix together until uniform then create a well in the middle.⁣ 4. Once the buttermilk is ready, whisk the melted butter into it, and then pour this wet mixture into the well of the dry mixture. Stir from the center outward, incorporating the flour as you go. If the dough is too wet, as flour as needed. We added in 1/2 cup more flour.⁣ 5. Knead the dough in the bowl until a nice smooth ball of dough forms. Place the dough ball onto your prepared baking sheet. We added additional raisins on top for aesthetic purposes, but this is not necessary.⁣ 6. Use a sharp knife to cut an X into the top of the bread dough to help with air ventilation. Place into the oven and bake for 40 – 45 minutes, or until golden.⁣ 7. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool before slicing.⁣ 8. We like to serve ours toasted with a smear of strawberry jam or vegan butter.⁣ ⁣ #vegan #stpatricksday #irishsodabread https://user_34.com/2018/03/10-ingredient-vegan-irish-soda-bread/

user_34;user_3448.jpg;ORANGE GINGER “BEEF” STIR FRY NOODLES 😍 See how I made this in my latest IGTV video! ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ We’ve all been there. Middle of the week with no motivation or ingredients to cook a dinner in. Or so we think! In my latest IGTV video, I partnered with @SunkistCitrus to challenge myself to use their citrus + ingredients I found in my kitchen to make dinner for Chris and I. I was able to make this bommmmb recipe using what we had. Stir fries are one of my favorite ways to not only use veggies up but to also get veggies in, especially greens! They are a great way to reduce our food waste and use things up that may have gone bad otherwise :) ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣ I challenge YOU to do the same -- try and only use ingredients that you already have in your kitchen and pantry to put a dinner together this week + let me know what you come up with! ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣ ⁣ #ad #sharewhatsreal #wyhw #user_34 #reducewaste #foodwaste

user_34;user_3451.jpg;Can you eat vegan at @sweettomatoes / @souplantation , @noodlescompany and @boldbajafresh?! YUPPP— let me show you how 🌚⁣ ⁣⁣ Chris and I are back with a another video where we tried to eat vegan at 3 different popular fast food spots! It’s up on our youtube channel if you want to see our full experience and review at these three restaurants, link in my bio or search “Sweet Simple Vegan” 🖤⁣😘 ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Here are our highlights:⁣⁣ * Sweet Tomatoes: It was actually really easy for us to eat vegan here— plus ALL of their food was labeled if it was vegan, vegetarian or gluten free etc. so it was a positive and stress free experience. I thought we’d have to ask the staff for help but it wasn’t necessary! Plus it was much more than just the salad bar. They had vegan salad dressings + vegan croutons, bread, vegan butter, 4 soup options, a baked potato bar (not much to stuff the potato with but we stuffed it with their lentil soup and it worked perfectly), and vegan pasta. ⁣ * Noodles and Co: On their website you can sort by dietary preference and it helps you find out what their vegan options are with ease. And it was pretty dang good! I got the Japanese pan noodles and Chris got the spicy peanut sautee. They also have a zucchini noodle option!⁣ *Baja Fresh: the vegan options weren’t anything special but it’s cool that we could still eat there. We used the post from “Cruelty Free Reviews” website plus the Baja Fresh website to navigate the options. We got a bean and rice burrito with roasted veggies + grilled veggie taco combo— just be sure to get the guacamole and salsa because those bring the dishes to life.⁣ ⁣⁣ It’s possible to eat at vegan at mainstream places nowadays and it’s getting easier as the years go by! We will definitely be doing more of these to show you how you can eat vegan almost anywhere ✨⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ #veganfastfood #veganbajafreah #veganmeltingpot #sweettomatoes #noodlesandco #user_34 https://youtu.be/7jlyxWDL8UQ
user_34;user_3452.jpg;5-MINUTE CREAMY LENTIL HUMMUS 😍 it’s easy to make and requires just 6 simple ingredients. Plus it’s so dang good you’ll be eating it by the spoonful 🤣🙏🏼 The recipe is below and also on our blog, linked in my bio or find it at https://user_34.com/2020/03/5-minute-creamy-lentil-hummus/ 😛⁣ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 head of garlic⁣ * 4 cups cooked lentils (we used brown) + more for garnish⁣ * 1/4-1/2 cup water⁣, or as needed to blend * 1/2 cup olive oil⁣ * 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice⁣ * 1/3 cup tahini⁣ * 1 to 1 1/4 teaspoon salt⁣ * Optional: 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin⁣ * Optional: Black pepper, to taste⁣ Top with:⁣ * Olive oil⁣ * Parsley⁣ * Cooked lentils⁣ * Smoked paprika⁣ * Black pepper⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove the flaky outer skin off of the garlic head and then cut the top off of a head of garlic. Place it into a sheet of foil with a drizzle of olive oil. Wrap it up loosely and then place it into the oven (directly on the rack) for 1 hour and cool until easy to handle.⁣ 2. Place the cooked lentils into a high speed blender (or a food processor–see notes), along with the water, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, salt, cumin, and black pepper. Unwrap the garlic head and squeeze the cooked garlic into the blender, being sure that no skins fall in. Blend until very smooth and fluffy.⁣ 3. Serve the hummus in wide bowls and top it with extra lentils along with any other toppings of choice. We used olive oil, lentils, paprika, parsley and black pepper.⁣ 4. Store the hummus in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * A high speed blender is recommended for this, but a food processor works as well. Keep in mind that with a food processor, it may not be as smooth and you will need to blend it a bit longer.⁣ ⁣ #vegan #hummus #veganrecipe #5minuterecipe #user_34 #feedfeed #bestofvegan

user_34;user_3456.jpg;We need to talk...⁣ ⁣ I’ve had this on my mind for the last few days but I first had to take some time to cool off before speaking without my emotions getting involved 🙏🏼⁣ ⁣ Social media can be a positive place that motivates and inspires us to make changes in our lives for the better. At the same time however, it can become a very dark, hateful and uncomfortable space. People feel like they can say what ever they want without consequence or accountability. I do support everyone being able to have their own opinions, but what I do not support is bringing others down because they don’t think/live/act how YOU want them to. ⁣ ⁣ It’s frustrating how the anonymity of the internet has made people so much more brave behind their screens, in a negative way.⁣ ⁣ People think that they can say anything that they want without any consequence because they don’t actually know the person they are speaking to. Guess what? There are consequences and BIG ones. Your comments will affect the person you are directing them to-- you have no idea what the person has or is going through, and you can trigger them/push them over the edge. ⁣ ⁣ When I was in my late teens/early twenties, I dealt with depression, an eating disorder and just overall low self-esteem. I have worked my ass off to get to where I’m at today with therapy, exercise and working on remaining positive (which I struggle with daily), but sometimes one comment can just shoot me down and make me feel like the effort wasn’t worth it. I’m not here to complain and I know that some people may say to “grow a thicker skin” and deal with it because it’s a “part of the job”, but I don’t agree. I think that online bullying and harassment is what needs to be dealt with, and it needs to stop.⁣ ⁣ ** If you see something like this happening, speak up-- respond to the negative comment/video and let them know that bullying/harassment is not cool and not right. The more we all work together to address this issue, the more progress we will make it getting it to STOP. ** ⁣ End rant haha thank you for taking the time to read! ❤️🙃 #user_34 #onlinebullying

user_34;user_3464.jpg;We finally finished our home office! 😍 After living in this house for almost 2 years, we thought that it was finally time to create a proper workspace for ourselves since we both work from home. It took a lot of time, effort and frustration (lol) to get this together but it’s done and I couldn’t be happier!! ⁣🎉⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ Our #1 tip for working from home is to create a *dedicated* workspace for yourself that you love. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy and of course you don’t need to redo a whole room like we did, but if you can, have a space that is solely for work and nothing else. The space we were living in prior to this one did not have a dedicated workspace and that lead to us working in the bedroom, kitchen, living room, etc. and it was far from ideal. Once we moved we wanted to create a work space that was not only motivating, but also inspiring. Since we both work from home, we wanted the space to be roomy enough for the two of us so we also made sure to get a large desk that we could both share but still have personal space on. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Shoutout to @hellomedley for this beautiful bamboo table! All of their furniture is eco-friendly, sustainably sourced and handcrafted in California with non-toxic materials. We LOVEEE this table and it is really what helped us bring this space together. ❤️⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣⁣ PS: Since it is more common now than ever to work remotely, we thought it would be helpful to share our top 5 for staying focused while working from home on our blog.

user_34;user_3465.jpg;FROZEN CHOCOLATE COVERED BANANAS WITH PEANUT BUTTER 😍 a match made in heaven. Just 3-ingredients, the perfect little bites to satisfy your sweet tooth AND easy to make! ⁣ ⁣ The recipe below and also on our blog at https://user_34.com/2019/02/chocolate-bananas-peanut-butter/ Enjoy!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Ingredients⁣⁣ * 3 medium to large bananas, ripe but still firm*⁣⁣ * 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter* (see notes)⁣⁣ * 1 cup (8 oz.) vegan chocolate chips⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Instructions⁣⁣ 1. Line a small baking sheet or plate with parchment paper and set aside.⁣⁣ 2. Peel the bananas and cut them into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange half of the slices on the lined baking sheet and set the rest aside.⁣⁣ 3. Using a small spoon or butter knife, spread about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter onto the bananas slices on the baking sheet. Top each half with the remaining banana slices to form “sandwiches”. Set the baking sheet into the freezer for 2 hours to set.⁣⁣ 4. Prepare the chocolate. Place chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl and microwave them for 30 seconds and then stir. Continue microwaving the chocolate in 30-second intervals, mixing in between each, until they are fully melted.⁣⁣ 5. Remove baking sheet from the freezer. Using two forks, quickly coat each “sandwich” banana sandwich in the melted chocolate, being sure to shake off any excess chocolate, and place it back onto the baking sheet. The chocolate may start to harden as you coat the bananas. This is normal and happens at the end of the batch as the temperature of the bananas encourages the chocolate to set. Just remelt the chocolate.⁣⁣ 6. Return the baking sheet to the freezer to set for 1 hour or until solid. After frozen, transfer the bites to an airtight freezer-safe container for up to 1 month.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Notes⁣⁣ * Make sure that the bananas are ripe, but still firm. If the bananas are too ripe, they will be soft and hard to work with.⁣⁣ * Another thick and creamy nut OR seed butter will work in place of peanut butter. The key is to use a one that is not runny. Sunflower, cashew and almond butter works great.⁣⁣ * Allow these to thaw for a few minutes before eating if your teeth are sensitive to cold. #vegan #user_34
user_34;user_3466.jpg;New video is live where I tried out recipes from popular vegan youtubers! ⁣ ⁣ I made @zannavandijk’s banana bread waffles, @cheaplazyvegan’s drunken noodles and @tessbegg’s best ever chocolate chip cookies from all from the vegan bundle. Also tacos from our ebook in the bundle Planting Our Roots 😛⁣ ⁣ + I used this opportunity to also clean out our pantry and fridge which we were in need of haha 😆 ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ As recipe developers and youtubers, Chris and I struggle sometimes in using up random ingredients we have leftover from the week. One of my main goals in 2020 is to reduce our food waste and to be proactive about getting creative in the kitchen to use things up. It’s tough sometimes to think outside of the box 😅 Since there are about 3000 vegan recipes in the vegan bundle, we decided to write down the ingredients we needed to use up and go through the recipes to see which ones used them. It was like a puzzle and actually so fun 🤣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ The bundle is only available for 3 more days and I highly recommend you check it out! It includes $1900 of ebooks for just $50– or about $0.55 per ebook.

I’ll be posting some of my favorite chocolate recipes from the blog so stay tuned for more 😛 You can find this recipe below and on our blog https://user_34.com/2019/02/chocolate-peanut-butter-fudge/ 🖤 ⁣ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 2 cups vegan chocolate chips of choice (we used semi-sweet)⁣ * 1 cup no-stir peanut butter (or any smooth and thick nut or seed butter; see notes)*⁣ * 1 tsp vanilla extract⁣ * Maldon salt, to garnish (optional)⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Line a medium dish with parchment paper. Set aside.⁣ 2. To a food processor, add the peanut butter and the vanilla extract.⁣ 3. Place the chocolate chips in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the chocolate in 30-second increments, mixing after each increment, until it is completely melted. Add the melted chocolate into the food processor and process until smooth. Alternatively you can melt the chocolate in a double boiler in the stove.⁣ 4. Using a spatula, transfer the fudge from the food processor to the lined dish, being sure to smooth out the top. Place into the refrigerator and allow the fudge to set for 1 hour, or until solidified.⁣ 5. Remove from the refrigerator. Loosen up the sides of the fudge using a butter knife and pop it out of the baking dish. Transfer to a cutting board and using a slightly wet sharp knife, cut into small squares (we cut 24).⁣ 6. Top the fudge with salt (optional) and dig in.⁣ 7. Transfer the fudge into an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks (see notes)*.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * We used Trader Joe’s Creamy no-stir peanut butter. ⁣ * If you are allergic to peanuts or prefer not to use them, another thick and creamy nut OR seed butter will work in its place. Just make sure that the nut or seed butter is not runny. to ensure that the fudge has the perfect consistency and sets properly. Sunflower, cashew and almond butter all work great.⁣ * You can also store in an airtight container in the freezer for about 3 months, just be sure to thaw for about 15 minutes before consuming.⁣"

We also used a @peta article to help us order! ⁣ * The Melting Pot: they had a VEGAN 4-Course Dinner— just ask for the vegan menu. They even had tofu and vegan meatballs. Update: some don’t have the full 4 course menu but we confirmed with melting pot that all locations have the vegan cheese fondue, chocolate and the veg broth is also vegan ♥️ * PF Chang’s: the vegetarian lettuce wraps were our favorite of our visit! We used a Veg Knowledge article to help us order.⁣ ⁣ It’s amazing how mainstream veganism has become and we will definitely be doing more of these videos to show you how to eat vegan almost anywhere ✨⁣ ⁣ #veganfastfood #veganatthecheesecakefactory #veganmeltingpot #meltingpot #pfchangs #veganpfchangs #user_34 https://youtu.be/3vnb27Jl7g0⁣

user_34;user_3485.jpg;This year I celebrate 8 years vegan 🌱 this year is also the best year for YOU to consider going vegan 🌚⁣ ⁣ I went vegan when I was just 18 years old and a freshman in college. Back then, going Vegan was tough 😅 Instagram was barely making its way into our lives and the vegan scene online was at its infancy. I remember being so pumped about making the lifestyle change but then hitting a dead end in my search for both resources to help me along the way as well as for a community that I could connect with during this change.⁣ ⁣ On top of that, my friends and family didn’t even know what the word “vegan” meant, let alone that it existed 😆 so it took a lot of convincing and explaining, plus dealing with uncomfortable questions and comments from people around me because, well, they thought I was straight up crazy. ⁣ ⁣ Now, to look back at 8 years ago when I barely had resources and people to refer to vs. now where there are vegan options at fast food restaurants all over the world, information being shared by mainstream media/celebrities, documentaries online/on Netflix, and way too many vegan recipes to choose from online... what a difference and accomplishment for the vegan movement! ⁣ ⁣ These all make it the best time for you to go vegan because it’s now SO EASY to do!⁣ ⁣ And to make it even easier?⁣ ⁣ I partnered with talented and knowledgeable individuals in the vegan community to put together “the vegan bundle” 😍with 60 of the best vegan ebooks available today but for only $50 — or $0.83 an ebook.

Cover the container and place the mixture into the refrigerator for about 2-3 hours to set, or until thick and cooled.⁣ 4. Remove the mousse from the refrigerator. Using a whisk or a spatula, vigorously mix the mousse to fluff it up.⁣ 5. Transfer the mousse into serving cups and add optional toppings of your choice. Enjoy!⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * We prefer full-fat coconut milk for this recipe as it yields the best results since it is higher in fat than other plant-based milks, but you can definitely use any other plant-based milk of your choice in this.⁣ * We have not tested this recipe with any other variety of dates but from our experience with other recipes, deglet noor will work in this, it will just alter the flavor slightly.⁣ #vegan #user_34 #vegandessert #veganrecipe #veganuary

user_34;user_3488.jpg;Calling all potato lovers 🥔 these crispy garlic and herb smashed potatoes are about to change your life. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, these smashed potatoes are garlicky and down-right delicious. They require just 7 simple ingredients and will be ready in less than an hour! Recipe is below, on our blog and also in my highlights! Enjoy! 😍 ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 2 lb. small yukon gold potatoes⁣ * 3 tbsp olive oil, avocado oil or melted vegan butter⁣ * 5 cloves garlic, finely minced⁣ * 1/2 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely minced⁣ * 1/2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, finely minced⁣ * 1 tbsp + 1/2 tsp salt (or as desired)⁣ * 1/4 tsp black pepper (or as desired)⁣ * Optional: 2-3 tbsp vegan parmesan cheese⁣, to top ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Preheat oven to 450°F and lightly grease a baking sheet OR line it with parchment paper/a silicone mat.⁣ 2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add in 1 tablespoon of salt along with all of the potatoes and cook on a simmer for about 15-30 minutes, or until tender and easily pierced with a fork. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes, so we recommend checking on them every 10 minutes by piercing the largest potato with the tip of a sharp knife. You will know when it’s ready when the knife slides in easily with no resistance.⁣ 3. Grab a small bowl and mix together the oil/butter, garlic, rosemary, thyme, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper until uniform. Set aside.⁣ 4. Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them and spread them evenly on the baking sheet. Using a drinking up, measuring cup, or potato masher, press down on the potatoes to “smash” them until they are about 1/2-inch thick (thinner potatoes = crispier result). Press down slowly so that they don’t break! Evenly distribute oil mixture onto the potatoes, trying your best to cover the whole surface of each.⁣ 5. Place the potatoes in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.⁣ 6. Remove the potatoes from the oven and top them with vegan parmesan cheese as desired. ⁣ #vegan #user_34 #veganrecipe #feedfeed #feedfeedvegan #bestofvegan https://user_34.com/2019/07/crispy-garlic-smashed-potatoes/

user_34;user_3492.jpg;DATE-SWEETENED BAKLAVA 😍⁣⁣ Sweet, flaky, and melt in your mouth good. Need I say more? Recipe below and on the blog, linked in my bio, enjoy!⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Ingredients⁣⁣ Filling⁣⁣ * 1 1/2 cups (11.87oz) pitted medjool dates, finely chopped*⁣⁣ * 1 cup (5.4 oz) almonds⁣⁣ * 1 cup (4 oz) walnuts⁣⁣ * 1 cup (4.12 oz) pistachios⁣⁣ * 1/2 tbsp orange zest⁣⁣ * 1/2 tbsp cinnamon⁣⁣ * 1/4 tsp salt⁣⁣ * 1 stick vegan butter, melted⁣⁣ * 32 sheets phyllo (filo) dough, defrosted⁣⁣ Syrup⁣⁣ * 1/2 cup date syrup ⁣⁣ * 1/2 cup filtered water⁣⁣ * 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, adjust to taste⁣⁣ * 1/2 tsp cinnamon⁣⁣ * 1/4 tsp salt⁣⁣ * 1/4 tsp ground cardamom (optional)⁣⁣ * 1 tsp vanilla extract⁣⁣ Topping⁣⁣ * 2 tbsp shelled unsalted pistachios, finely chopped or crushed⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Instructions⁣⁣ 1. In a food processor, add in the dates, almonds, walnuts, pistachios, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt. Pulse until the mixture is just roughly chopped. You do not want them to be fine as they will not have the right consistency for the baklava. Set aside.⁣⁣ 2. Grab your phyllo dough and a medium baking dish (ours was 10×8″).⁣⁣ 3. Placed it on a clean work surface and then put a baking dish on top. Be sure not to press down so hard so you don’t compact the phyllo. Using a sharp knife, trim the phyllo to the size of the pan. It is better to cut bigger than smaller here so if it is not perfect, don’t worry because once it bakes you won’t be able to tell. This step is optional, you can also just fold in the edges as you layer the baklava. This will just yield the best results.⁣⁣ 4. Cover the phyllo with a slightly damp tea towel to keep it from drying out. Set aside.⁣⁣ 5. Brush the bottom and sides of the baking dish with a thin layer of melted vegan butter. Lay on two sheets of the phyllo and then gently drizzle it with vegan butter. We did not brush on the vegan butter as it may rip the phyllo. Repeat the layering, buttering ever 2 sheets of phyllo, until you have a base of 8 sheets of phyllo.⁣⁣ ⁣ (Continued in comments) ⁣ ⁣ #vegan #user_34 #datesweetened #feedfeed #feedfeedvegan #feedfeedbaking https://user_34.com/2018/10/date-sweetened-baklava/

user_34;user_3497.jpg;PECAN, CRANBERRY & ORANGE SHORTBREAD COOKIES 😍 #ad @americanpecan challenged me to create a holiday recipe that showcases the versatile, nutrient dense and power-packed protein nut, the PECAN, and this is what I came up with! Did you know that they are the only major tree nut native to North America and are now harvested in over a dozen Southern states?— What better way to celebrate the holidays than with some cookies? And not just any cookies, these are shortbread cookies with chunks of naturally sweet & buttery pecans, tart and chewy cranberry pieces PLUS a fresh kick of zested orange. It doesn’t get any better than that! The recipe is below :) Enjoy!⁣ ⁣ Cookies⁣ * 1 stick (1/2 cup) vegan butter, softened⁣ * 1/4 cup (51g) light brown sugar⁣ * 1/8 cup (31g) granulated sugar⁣ * 1 teaspoon (4g) vanilla extract⁣ * 1/2 teaspoon (3.5g) salt⁣ * 1/2 cup (3 ounces or 60g) fresh pecan pieces⁣ * 1/2 cup (68g) dried cranberries⁣ * Zest of 1 orange (4g or about 1/2 tbsp)⁣ * 1 1/4 cups (150g) all purpose flour⁣ ⁣ Icing⁣ * 1/2 cup powdered  sugar⁣ * 1/2 tablespoon orange juice⁣ * 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract⁣ * Water or almond milk, as needed to thin⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Toast the pecans: Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Evenly distribute the pecans on the baking sheet and place into the oven to toast for 5 minutes. Watch carefully as they burn easily! Cool completely before proceeding.⁣ 2. In the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat together the vegan butter and sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and continue beating.⁣ 3. Next, add in all of the cranberries and flour and slowly beat it in until combined. The dough may seem crumbly but the last step here is to use clean hands to squeeze and sort of “knead” the dough together until it comes together and compacts into a cookie dough. Add in the crushed pecans and mix it together by hand just until combined.⁣ (continued in comments)  #user_34 #pecans #veganrecipe #vegancookies #christmascookies #vegan #feedfeed #feedfeedbaking #feedfeedvegan

Sweet, nutty and melt-in-your-mouth gooood. Dip them in some non-dairy milk and trust us, it will be love at first bite. Oh and don’t forget to leave some out for Santa 😂⁣ Recipe is below and linked in my bio, enjoy ✨ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 cup whole walnuts⁣ * 3/4 cups organic cane sugar⁣ * 3/4 cups organic brown sugar⁣ * 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon⁣ * 4 oz. vegan cream cheese⁣ * 4 oz. vegan butter⁣ * 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour + more for rolling⁣ * 2 tbsp unsweetened almond milk⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Preheat the oven to 325°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.⁣ 2. In a food processor, pulse the walnuts until they are finely ground. Transfer the walnuts to a large bowl along with the cane sugar and cinnamon. Set aside.⁣ 3. In a large mixing bowl, cream the vegan cream cheese and butter together until fluffy. Gradually add the all-purpose flour until it forms a smooth dough. If the dough is too soft, add a little more flour. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.⁣ 4. Flour a clean work surface. Once the dough has chilled, roll it out into about a 15×12″ rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Using a brush, lightly coat the dough with the almond milk. Liberally sprinkle the moistened dough with the cinnamon sugar mixture.⁣ 5. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, cut dough into strips (about 2 to 2 1/2-inches long x 1-inch wide). It is easiest to first cut the dough into long 1-inch strips lengthwise and then to cut those horizontally into 2 to 2 1/2-inches long strips. Pick up one strip and gently twist the dough into a spiral shape. You can refer to a photo of the final cookie in the blog post to get a better idea of the final appearance. If any sugar falls out, you can roll the cookie dough in it.⁣ 6. Lay the twists onto lined the baking sheet.

user_34;user_34109.jpg;CLASSIC VEGAN BROWNIES 🍫 finally, this recipe is finished!! These babies are sweetened to perfection, a mix of both cake-y AND fudge-y, plus require simple ingredients and ready in less than an hour 😍 I made this recipe with @floridacrystalssugar and in the blog post I chatted about my trip to their farm, their vegan sugar PLUS how to know if your sugar is actually vegan— link is in my bio 🙏🏼⁣ (PS if anyone is confused the last photo is me at the Florida Crystals farm haha) ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 stick (1/2 cup) vegan butter⁣ * 1 1/3 cup (300g) Florida Crystals organic cane sugar⁣ * 2 teaspoons (8g) vanilla extract⁣ * 3 tablespoons (49g) unsweetened applesauce⁣ * 1 1/2 cups (188g) unbleached all-purpose flour⁣ * 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp (60g) Dutch processed cocoa powder⁣ * 1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) baking powder⁣ * 1 teaspoon (7g) salt⁣ * 1 oz. good quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (60-70% cacao), finely chopped⁣ * Optional: Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling at the end⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1.

user_34;user_34113.jpg;NO BAKE PUMPKIN CHAI CHEESECAKE 😍 An easy, vegan and gluten-free dessert that everyone, vegan or not, is going to LOVE. A creamy cashew and coconut filling that is perfectly spiced and poured over a nutty date crust 🔥 This cheesecake is full of flavor and perfect for the holidays! Recipe is below and linked in my bio ✨⁣ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ Crust⁣ * 1 cup packed deglet noor or medjool dates (pitted before measuring), roughly chopped⁣ * 1 cup raw walnuts*⁣ * 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds (or additional 1/2 cup walnuts)⁣ * 1 tbsp refined coconut oil, melted*⁣ * 1/4 tsp salt⁣ Filling⁣ * 2 cups raw cashews, soaked and strained*⁣ * 1/2 cup canned full-fat coconut milk*⁣ * 1/2 cup pure maple syrup⁣ * 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp pumpkin puree⁣ * ¼ cup refined coconut oil, melted*⁣ * 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice⁣ * 1 tsp pure vanilla extract⁣ * 1/2 tsp ground cardamom⁣ * 1/2 tsp cinnamon⁣ * 1/2 tsp turmeric⁣ * 1/4 tsp salt⁣ * 1/8 tsp cloves⁣ * 1/8 tsp nutmeg⁣ * Pinch of black pepper*⁣ Toppings of choice, such as⁣ * Vegan whipped cream⁣ * Pumpkin seeds⁣ * Date Syrup⁣ * Cinnamon ⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Prepare a large springform pan. We lined the bottom of ours with parchment paper and then sprayed the sides with coconut oil to ensure that the cheesecake did not stick.⁣ 2. Add the Deglet Noor dates to a food processor and run until broken down into small pieces. Add in the remaining ingredients and process until a dough forms. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides to ensure that everything is blended together. You will know that it is the right consistency if it sticks together when you press some of the crust in between your pointer finger and thumb. If it is too dry, add more melted coconut oil 1/2 tablespoon at a time.⁣ 3. Transfer the crust mixture into the springform pan and gently begin to press it down into a crust to form a bottom layer. It is okay if you have some of the crust come up the sides as well.  Once you have evenly pressed down the crust, place the pan into the freezer as you prepare the filling.⁣ (Continued in comments) ⁣ ⁣ #vegan #user_34 #vegancheesecake #veganrecipe #nobake #chaicheesecake #bestofvegan https://user_34.com/2018/11/

It’s is an easy vegan and gluten-free entree perfect for holiday dinners or date nights at home and will be ready in less than an hour ✨ Recipe is below and also linked in my bio, enjoy 🖤 ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 6 large portobello mushrooms⁣ * 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar⁣ * 1/4 cup tamari (or soy sauce if not gluten-free)⁣ * 2 tablespoons olive oil⁣ * 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce (We used Edward & Son’s)⁣ * 1 teaspoon liquid smoke⁣ * 1/2–1 teaspoon black pepper (depending on how pepper-y you would like it)⁣ * 1 teaspoon garlic powder⁣ * 1 teaspoon onion powder⁣ * 2 sprigs fresh thyme, stems removed and finely chopped⁣ * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. De-stem each portobello mushroom, leaving just the caps. Discard, compost or save the stems for homemade vegetable broth. Set mushroom caps aside.⁣ 2. In a large-sized wide and shallow dish, combine all of the ingredients except for the mushrooms. Whisk together until fully combined.⁣ 3. Add in the portobello mushroom caps to the marinade and flip them back and forth a few times for fully coat both sides. If needed, use a spoon to pour the marinade over the mushrooms. Allow the mushrooms to marinate for at least 15-30 minutes, the longer the better!⁣ 4. Once the mushrooms have marinated, heat a grill or a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once warmed, add the portobello mushrooms along with any remaining marinade* and cook on each side for 4-5 minutes, or until softened and a deep golden brown. Gently flip the mushrooms as they will be fragile!⁣ 5. Serve warm with sides of choice. This goes well with mashed potatoes or our fall rice pilaf!⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * We grilled asparagus to serve alongside our portobello mushroom steaks. Instead of pouring the remaining marinade in with the mushrooms, we saved it and used it to marinate the asparagus. It turned out delicious and is highly recommended!⁣ #vegan #user_34 #veganrecipes #holidayrecipes #veganchristmasdinner https://user_34.com/2018/11/vegan-portobello-mushroom-steaks/

It also feels nice to travel and not have to check every single ingredient label + double check with the staff a million times if the options they are giving me are really vegan 😂 They actually have had vegan options for almost 7 years now and I think it’s safe to say they were ahead of the curve and vegan before it was cool 🌚 If you ever visit Boulder, even if you don’t stay at the hotel, treat yo self to a spa day and/or even to their all vegan brunch buffet on Friday/vegan dinner on Mondays, you wont regret it!

It’s perfect for meal prep, on the go and even for picky eaters!⁣ Find the full recipe below and also on the blog, linked in my bio 🖤 ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or non-dairy milk of your choice)⁣ * 1/2 cup pumpkin puree⁣ * 2–3 tablespoons maple syrup (or to taste)⁣ * Optional: 1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract⁣ * 1 teaspoon cinnamon⁣ * 1/4 teaspoon ginger⁣ * 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg⁣ * Pinch of cloves⁣ * Pinch of salt⁣ * (OR you can use 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices)⁣ * 1/4 cup chia seeds* (see notes)⁣ Toppings (Optional)⁣ * Coconut yogurt⁣ * Raspberries⁣ * Ground cinnamon⁣ * Pumpkin seeds⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Add all of the ingredients except for the chia seeds to a medium sized bowl and whisk together until uniform.⁣ 2. Add in the chia seeds and mix until well combined.⁣ 3. Place into the refrigerator to set for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.⁣ 4. Serve with toppings of your choice and enjoy!⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * I suggest adding an additional 1 tablespoon of chia seeds if you would like for this to be really thick. We like it slightly loose so we chose to do 4 tablespoons.⁣ * If you like spice heavy pumpkin pie flavor, you can increase the spices in this recipe by half.⁣ * We prefer a neutral milk such as almond milk for this recipe but if you would like for it to be a bit more decadent and flavored, coconut milk works great in this!⁣ * This recipe should last for 7 days in an airtight container in the fridge. https://user_34.com/2019/11/pumpkin-pie-chia-seed-pudding/ #vegan #veganrecipe #pumpkinpie #chiapudding #mealprep #healthybreakfast #foodphotography #bestofvegan #foodtography
user_34;user_34127.jpg;Sometimes you meet someone, and it’s so clear that the two of you, on some level belong together. As lovers, or as friends, or as family, or as something entirely different. You just work, whether you understand one another or you’re in love or you’re partners in crime. You meet these people throughout your life, out of nowhere, under the strangest circumstances, and they help you feel alive. I don’t know if that makes me believe in coincidence, or fate, or sheer blind luck, but it definitely makes me believe in something. — Auliq Ice ✨ • Cheers to the weekend, these @stjulienhotel views and doin life with my booo 😘 I don’t know what it is, maybe it’s the time of year, but I just want to say that I’m grateful for everything going on in my life right now, especially this guy right here. He’s taught me that a positive mindset is a choice and I now choose to be positive in the life I live. I’ve never been happier 🖤 • #vegan #veganboulder #boulderco #user_34 #flatirons

We celebrate all of the brands that are bringing vegan and cruelty-free products to the market like @100percentpure, and encouraging more people to choose cleaner and healthier products. Today we celebrate just how far this movement has come (especially in the last decade!). I went vegan in 2012 and I would have never imagined the strides that we all have taken to better this planet. I’m excited to see what the future holds for veganism 🥰 ……. PS! 100 Percent Pure launched a new powder skincare line which includes this Matcha Oat Milk Nourishing Face Mask. + If you know me and how much I love matcha lattes, you know I had to try it out!

In a large mixing bowl, add in the coconut oil and coconut sugar. Using an electric hand mixer (or a whisk if you are doing this by hand), cream together the oil and sugar until fluffy and smooth.

user_34;user_34142.jpg;"It’s #WorldMentalHealthDay and I just wanted to send a reminder that even if you don’t have a mental illness, mental health is just as important as physical health and we need to end the stigma around it ✨⁣ ⁣ If you have been following me for a while, you might know that when I was 18 I struggled with an eating disorder and depression. I felt alone, scared and SO uncomfortable with myself...I didn’t even share what was going on with my best friends and family because I already felt judged and misunderstood by societal views of mental health and illness. Instead of accepting the situation and seeking help, I, instead, blamed myself for what was going on in my head and constantly criticized and judged myself— it was a viscous cycle that dug me deeper into the hole I was already in.⁣ ———————⁣ If I could go back in time and talk to myself, I would tell myself this: ⁣ ⁣ It’s okay to to not be okay! Life isn’t all about being happy, bubbly, and perfectly “curated” all the time like we often see online. You don’t have to force yourself to look or act a certain way for anyone; instead focus on accepting what’s going on in your life and understanding that everyone goes through hard times. ⁣ ⁣ Remember that it does not make you any less brave or strong to seek help, but actually, the exact opposite. Don’t ever be ashamed to talk about your mental health or reach out to others when you’re in a time of need. There are SO many people in your life that love you and would want to help you during this time, you just need to open up and let them in. ⁣ ——————⁣ I read a conversation with Kristen Bell talking about how mental health check-ins should be as routine as going to the doctor or the dentist and I 100% agree! I think we all should also remember to check in with our family and friends, even if it means just reaching out and letting them know that we love them and are thinking of them. Let them know that we are here for them if they ever need us because a this small action can make all the difference.⁣ ⁣ We need to help those struggling with mental illness by encouraging more conversation regarding mental health so we can end the stigma. 🖤 #user_34"
user_34;user_34143.jpg;These Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies got me feeling some type of way 🍪 So many of you requested that we make these when we asked for recipe suggestions and I’m so glad you did, they are magic ✨ Gluten-free and vegan + SO easy to make! 🖤⁣ The recipe is below and also on our blog, link in my bio 😋 ⁣⁣ Ingredients⁣⁣ * 3/4 cup vegan butter, melted⁣⁣ * 3/4 cup organic granulated sugar⁣⁣ * 3/4 cup packed organic brown sugar⁣⁣ * 3/4 cup pumpkin puree⁣⁣ * 2 tsp vanilla⁣⁣ * 2 1/2 cups Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-Free 1:1 Baking Flour (or sub all-purpose flour if not gluten-free)⁣⁣ * 1 tsp baking soda⁣⁣ * 1 tsp salt⁣⁣ * 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice⁣⁣ * 1/2 tsp baking powder⁣⁣ * 1 1/4 cups vegan chocolate chips⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Instructions⁣⁣ 1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. This recipe makes 3 dozen so you will need to bake in batches. See notes for freezing options.⁣⁣ 2. In a large bowl, mix together the vegan butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, pumpkin and vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice and salt until a dough forms. Fold in chocolate chips until well incorporated.⁣⁣ 3. Optional: Set the dough into the fridge to chill. Since we are using melted vegan butter, the cookies on their own (unchilled) will be chewier and flatter cookies. If you would like them to spread less and be more cake like, set the dough in the fridge for 2 hours.⁣⁣ 4. Using a tablespoon sized scooper, drop mounds of dough onto the baking sheet 2 inches apart.⁣ 5. Bake for 13-14 minutes, or until the edges brown. The cookies will seem soft but don’t worry, they will firm up as they cool. Allow them to rest on the baking sheet for 1 minute and then transfer them to a cooling rack. Cool completely.⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ See comments for notes! #vegan #feedfeed #chocolatechipcookies #bestofvegan #veganrecipe #user_34 #feedfeedvegan #pumpkincookies #fallrecipe #foodphotography https://user_34.com/2019/10/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-cookies/
user_34;user_34144.jpg;It’s #HispanicHeritageMonth and I’m partnering up with @krogerco to celebrate my Ecuadorian culture and share one of my favorite recipes with you that my grandma used to make for my brother and I as kids— Llapingacho (aka Ecuadorian Potato Patties). ⁣ .⁣ .⁣ In 1970, my grandparents took a leap of faith and immigrated to the United States in hopes of giving their children (and future generations) a better life. They made a lot of sacrifices for their family along the way, and I just want to share how grateful I am for them and all that they have done for me. They have always taught me to be confident and proud of who I am and where I come from, and I really wouldn’t be doing what I do now without them in my life. I’ve been longing to get back into the kitchen with my grandma to veganize more Ecuadorian recipes, but for now, I’m sharing this llapingacho with you all in her honor! ⁣ .⁣ .⁣ Shoutout to @krogerco and our local @fredmeyerstores for having so many vegan options to choose from and for helping me veganize this recipe with ease. I posted the full recipe on IGTV and on our blog user_34. com, so I hope that you can try these out and that you enjoy making them + eating them as much as I did! #vegan #user_34 #veganecuadorian #llapingacho #recipe #hispanicheritage https://user_34.com/2019/10/vegan-llapinagachos #ad

user_34;user_34147.jpg;Easy dog-friendly pumpkin spice “latte” aka puppy spice latte! 😂 Berry wanted to join in on the fall festivities so we created this fun recipe for him to dive into 😊 The recipe will be down below + please always be sure to check in with your veterinarian before giving your dogs new foods/if you have any concern with certain ingredients 🐶 ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 1 cup pumpkin puree⁣ * 3/4 cup water⁣ * 1/2 cup crushed ice⁣ * 3 tablespoons coconut meat⁣ * 1 heaping tablespoon peanut butter⁣ * 1/4 teaspoon ground pumpkin pie spice⁣ or cinnamon * Dog treats to top (we used V-Dog breath bones)⁣ Coconut whipped cream:⁣ * 1 can coconut cream or full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Place all of the smoothie ingredients into a blender and run until smooth.⁣ 2. For the whipped cream, remove your can of coconut cream or milk from the refrigerator and carefully open it, trying to avoid shaking it. Scoop the top portion of the can into a chilled bowl and discard the liquid (or save it for smoothies, etc.). Use a hand or standing mixer to whip the coconut cream until fluffy.⁣ 3. Pour the smoothie into two cups or bowls, then scoop or pipe on the whipped coconut cream.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * Coconut is non-toxic to dogs, but it does contain medium chain triglycerides, which may cause some gastrointestinal upset and bloating. Please check in with your veterinarian if you have any concern. Berry has never shown any negative reactions to the ingredient, so we felt comfortable using it in this recipe.⁣ * Please be sure to use all natural peanut butter with no additives for the safety of your dogs. The only ingredient should be peanuts!⁣

user_34;user_34151.jpg;One of my favorite things to do as a recipe developer is to recreate/veganize foods that I grew up eating.

user_34;user_34154.jpg;*NEW* step-by-step tutorial on how to make this Easy Chia Seed Jam is live on our blog🍓 It requires just 4 simple ingredients and about 20 minutes of your time. Plus, it’s a healthier alternative to store bought jam, a great way to pack more berries into your diet and can be used just as you would regular jam!⁣ Recipe is linked in my bio and I’ll also put it below ✨ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 2 cups fresh or frozen berries of your choice⁣ * 3 tablespoons water⁣ * 3 tablespoons coconut sugar * (see notes)⁣ * 3 tablespoons chia seeds * 1 tablespoon fresh lemon Juice⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. If you are using fresh berries, roughly chop them before using. Add the berries to a small pot over medium heat along with 3 tablespoons of water.  Cook until the berries begin to break down and become syrupy in texture, about 12-14 minutes. Use the back of a spatula or a potato masher to mash the fruit, leaving it as smooth or as lumpy as you like.⁣ 2. Once the berries have broken down, stir in the coconut sugar and cook the mixture for 2 minutes more.⁣ 3. Remove the pot from heat and stir in the chia sees and lemon juice. Mix thoroughly to combine.⁣ 4. Allow the mixture to sit for at least 5 minutes to thicken. The longer it sits, the thicker it will get! Transfer the chia seed jam to an airtight jar or container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * I used a mixture of strawberries and blueberries for this jam, but you can use any mixture of berries of your choice. Blackberries and raspberries would be great in this!⁣ * You can also use a liquid sweetener of your choice in this recipe instead of coconut sugar if you prefer.⁣ * This jam can be frozen if you would like to make a big batch at once. We just suggest placing the jar or container that it is in in the refrigerator to thaw overnight before using.⁣ #vegan #user_34 #easyrecipe #chiaseedjam #howto #veganrecipe https://user_34.com/2019/09/easy-chia-seed-jam/

user_34;user_34160.jpg;Take your brunchin’ to the next level with this Vegan Brunch Charcuterie Board! 😍 I wanted to put something special together for my family while I was visiting, so I made it happen with the help of @mailleus. This board was inspired by the time I’ve spent up in the Portland area this past year. One of my favorite things to do with my friends up here is to grub on weekend brunch and let me tell ya, Portland does brunch REAL GOOD 😋 So, combining our love for brunch with a few flavors and ingredients that Oregon is known for, we picked up groceries from our local Vons and this board was born! On the board we included tofu scramble (recipe on our blog), homemade vegan hollandaise with Maille Dijon (recipe on our blog), fresh berries, hazelnuts, microgreens, Maille cornichons, avocado, mini bagels, waffles, crackers, vegan American cheese, vegan cream cheese, and vegan sausage. Plus, from now until 9/22 you can save $1.00 on any (1) Maille product (Mustard/Pickles) at Albertsons or Safeway 🤘🏻 #ad #TheDifferenceIsAllMaille #Albertsons #Safeway #user_34 #crueltyfreecharcuterie
user_34;user_34161.jpg;Chris and I visited Vancouver, BC over the long weekend and all I’ve got to say is WOW, I wish we had visited sooner! It’s vegan-friendly (there were too many restaurants on our list, I was overwhelmed haha), dog-friendly, absolutely gorgeous and everyone we interacted with lived up to the Canadian stereotype, they were SO nice 😂 Our favorite vegan food spot that we visited was hands down @meetgastown! It was also the most recommended spot from you guys so thanks for that, it lived up to the hype 😍 All of the pictures above are from our meal — (all vegan) Big Mac, oyster mushroom kalamari, buttered chick’n poutine, sweet chili cauliflower, crispy chick’n sandwich, and last but not least a cronut (croissant donut) with marshmallow ice cream. I have a highlight on my page “Vancouver BC” documenting our trip and we will have a YouTube vlog coming soon! #user_34 #vegan #vancouverbc #meetgastown
user_34;user_34162.jpg;Celebrating my 26th birthday 🎂🎉 in Vancouver, BC with my boys this weekend. If there’s anything that I can share/take away from this past year it’s to be present, patient and most importantly, more forgiving ✨ Life’s too short to hold on to things in the past that no longer serve us or any negativity in our life 🤷🏽‍♀️ It’s tough for me sometimes but I need to learn how to let go + focus on the things that really matter and what I have in my life to be grateful for. A lot of big things happened in my 25th year so I’m excited to see where this year takes me! ✨ Thanks for the constant love and support on this platform. Social media is weird sometimes but I’m grateful that this space we created here on SSV is a positive one 🙃 #user_34 #birthday #thisis26 #vancouverbc

user_34;user_34164.jpg;I didn’t go vegan overnight, it actually took me a little while to transition animals products out and vegan alternatives in but THAT’S OKAY. I used to beat myself up about it when I was in the process and for some reason felt embarrassed because I didn’t have the “willpower” to go cold turkey (for lack of a better term), but I realized that small changes are still changes and they still affect the bigger picture. ⁣ ⁣ (Before I forget, pictured is the vegan pastrami sandwich from @counterpartdeli in LA lol)⁣ ⁣ I was still making a difference, and if you are in the same boat, you are too! If I made a huge change overnight, it would not have been sustainable for me and I would have bounced right back to eating animal products because I would have been convinced it was “too hard” to change. With my slow transition, I was able to take things one step at a time, at a pace that was feasible with my lifestyle, and I was able to form new habits and break old ones without feeling overwhelmed 🤷🏽‍♀️⁣ ⁣ Making changes to something as intrinsic as a diet is tough! It’s not just choosing different foods to put on your plate, but it’s also breaking and changes lifelong habits and even traditions. I come from an Ecuadorian and Filipino background so trust me, I know!😩⁣ ⁣ It’s more important than ever before that we push ourselves to make changes on our plate — to do better for our planet, our health and the animals. 🌎 I’m not one to aggressively push veganism on people or be “preachy”, but I just hope that the fires in the Amazon help people see how much destruction is caused by our consumption and dietary choices. The fires were no accident and it weren’t a natural occurrence. And, they are the most devastating fires to date. If you didn’t know, fires are intentionally started to clear land for cattle ranching, soy (mostly fed to animals of the industry), palm oil, and other uses. If we can change our habits and decrease the demand for these products, we can do our part in working to do better for our planet. ⁣ ⁣ Thanks for reading this random rant through if you made it this far, and happy Tuesday 😬🖤🙏🏼 #user_34 #counterpartdeli #amazon #vegan

It’s from the @veganyackattack On The Go Cookbook! Definitely a book that is great for those of you new to the kitchen or who just want quick meals! She was nice enough to let us share the recipe with ya so I’ll link it in my bio and also share it below 😊  Ingredients⁣ * 1 tablespoon (15 ml) sunflower oil⁣ * 1 cup (140 g) diced onion⁣ * 2 cups (280 g) chopped zucchini⁣ * 4 ounces (120 g) green beans⁣ * 2 large carrots, sliced into rounds*⁣ * 2 cloves garlic, minced⁣ * 3 cups (500 g) chopped tomatoes⁣ * 1½ cups (315 g) cooked corn kernels⁣ * 2 cans (30 ounces, or 850 g) white beans, plus liquid⁣ * 1 cup (235 ml) low-sodium vegetable broth⁣ * 1 teaspoon dried basil, or more to taste⁣ * ½ teaspoon dried parsley, or more to taste⁣ * 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste⁣ * Pinch of crushed red pepper (optional)⁣ * 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1.

Taste the stew and season with salt, plus more herbs if you prefer. Serve hot.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ 1. At certain grocery stores you can buy grilled corn in the freezer section.

user_34;user_34171.jpg;#ad Today is an exciting day because Burger King just launched their Impossible Whopper! It’s just as good as their OG whopper but this time, the patty is made from plants. I used to dig into whoppers all of the time as a kid with my dad (especially when my mom was out of town, it was always the best haha) and it really brought me back to my childhood digging into this. High five to Burger King for adding this plant-based option. To all my vegan followers, ask for the Impossible Whopper without mayo + ask for the burger microwaved if you prefer for it not to be cooked on the same grill as beef and chicken. You can check out the Impossible Whopper in stores now or even order some through door dash or the BK app. #burgerking #impossiblewhopper #user_34

user_34;user_34175.jpg;Homemade marinara sauce aka gravvvy 😍 Fresh is always best and this only takes 30 minutes and 10 simple ingredients to make so what are you waiting for? 🌚 The recipe is down below and also linked in my bio!  INGREDIENTS • 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil* • 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced • 1/2 large onion, finely chopped (1 1/4 cups) • 2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes* (see notes) • 1 dried bay leaf • 3 tablespoons tomato paste • 20 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped* (see notes) • 2 teaspoons dried oregano • 1/4 teaspoon crushed red peppers • 1 teaspoon kosher salt • Black pepper, as desired  INSTRUCTIONS (1) In a large pan over medium heat, add in the olive oil. Once warmed, add the onion and garlic. Sauté until the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant, about 4 minutes. (2) Next, add in the canned tomatoes (with juice), and gently break them apart using either a wooden spoon or a potato masher. Be careful as they may splatter. (3) Add in all of the remaining ingredients and mix until uniform. Simmer uncovered on low for 20 minutes, or the sauce reaches your desired consistency, stirring often. Remove from heat and remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired (4) Serve over your favorite pasta or even with some homemade mozzarella sticks.  NOTES • We prefer using olive oil as it adds a great flavor to the sauce, but if you would like to make this oil-free, feel free to use vegetable broth the sauté the onions and garlic. For this, I would start with just 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth and add more as needed, 2 tablespoons at a time, to prevent burning. • Canned diced tomatoes will work as well, we just use whole for an extra chunky sauce.

user_34;user_34177.jpg;Vegan Frozen Yogurt that requires just 4-ingredients and less than 5 minutes to make? Yes please! Recipe is below and also on our blog, linked in my bio 🍓  Ingredients⁣ * 3 cups frozen strawberries* (see notes)⁣ * 3/4 cup unsweetened plain vegan yogurt* (see notes)⁣ * 1 teaspoons vanilla extract⁣ * 3 to 4 tablespoons maple syrup (or as desired)⁣ * Optional: fresh mint, for garnish⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Add all of the ingredients (except for the mint) into a high speed blender or food processor and blend until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Adjust the sweetness to taste.⁣ 2. Serve immediately or transfer it to an airtight container and place it into the freezer for 2-3 hours to harden up a bit (as pictured above). You can store the vegan frozen yogurt in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 1 month, just be sure to leave it out for 10-15 minutes to soften.⁣ ⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * You can use store bought frozen strawberries OR fresh frozen strawberries for this recipe. To freeze strawberries at home, line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Remove the stems from your strawberries and half them, then lay them out in a single layer on the baking sheet and place that into the refrigerator until the strawberries are frozen solid, about 8 hours or overnight.⁣ * If you would like, you could use medjool dates in place of the maple syrup but just keep in mind that you may need to add a few tablespoons of water to get things going if there isn’t enough liquid to blend it.⁣ * You can use sweetened and flavored yogurt, just keep in mind that this will alter the flavor of the frozen yogurt in the end. If you are using sweetened yogurt, you will need to adjust the maple syrup or remove it all together based on your preference. If you are using vanilla yogurt, the addition of vanilla extract may not be necessary.⁣ * If you prefer not to use strawberries, try 3 cups of your favorite fruit (frozen)! Results may vary and we have not tested this out ourselves, but our next test is going to be frozen blueberries and peaches!⁣ #vegan #recipe #5minute #frozenyogurt #froyo #user_34 #feedfeed #bestofvegan #letscookvegan

It’s actually really fun, its like a game 😂 I shared the recipes that I put together on my story if you want to follow along!

user_34;user_34179.jpg;If you’ve ever driven through Coachella Valley, you’re probably familiar with their 𝐟𝐚𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 😛 Everyone has their own special way of making date shakes, so today we are sharing with you the SSV way. Date shakes usually include a base of vanilla ice cream, dates, and milk, followed by additional ingredients to give it a personal twist. We went with nutmeg and a pinch of salt, but we listed them as optional ingredients and kept the 3-ingredient base intact for you to play around with. Have fun with this shake and bring it a twist of your own– fresh fruit or even cacao powder would be great additions! Recipe is below and is also available via the link in my bio☺️ Ingredients  Date Shake * 1 1/2 cups vegan vanilla ice cream (we used So Delicious) * 1/2 cup Medjool dates, pitted* (see notes) * 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk * Optional: pinch of salt * Optional: pinch of ground nutmeg  Toppings (Optional) * Vegan whipped cream (homemade or store bought) * Cherry* (see notes) * Mint  Instructions 1. Add all of the ingredients for the shake into a high speed blender and blend until smooth, or about 30-50 seconds. 2. Pour the shake into 2 small glasses (or 1 large glass) and add toppings as desired. Enjoy!  Notes * Other date varieties may be used, although they may alter the flavor and texture of the shake. Some dates have a thicker skin and will result in more texture but will still work. * We opted not to use maraschino cherries as most are not vegan as they contain carmine (also known as Natural Red 4 or “added color”) which is an insect-derived red food coloring that comes from cochineal bugs. If you would like to use vegan maraschino cherries, check out the brand “Tillen Farms”. #vegan #dateshake #coachella #palmsprings #milkshake #feedfeedvegan #bestofvegan #milkshake #eeeeeats #shieldsdatefarm #shieldsdateshake https://user_34.com/2019/07/date-shake/

user_34;user_34181.jpg;After going vegan, I became so much more aware of ingredient labels and the products that I was using and consuming — I wanted to make sure that I chose the best of the best not only for the inside of my body, but for the outside of my body as well. Since our skin is the largest organ of our body and since it is so porous, it absorbs what we put on it. Almost 2 years ago I discovered @bioclarity and it checked all of the boxes — vegan, cruelty-free, paraben free, sulfate free and fragrance free for my sensitive skin. If you have been following me for a while, you will know that I am ride of die for their skincare routines, I swear by them! They finally FINALLY came out with their Dewy Dew toner that I have been using not only after I cleanse, but also as my makeup setting spray and I am in LOVE! If you guys want to check it out, I have a link in my story for 40% off any routine PLUS you can use my code SSVEGAN for an extra 15% off your entire order 🖤 Happy Tuesday! #bioclaritypartner #bioclarity #allgreensnogunk #user_34

It’s full of flavor, easy to make and packed with plant-protein! Growing up in Southern California and having a ton of family and friends from Mexico, carne asada was a big part of my diet growing up. It is something that I have definitely missed since going vegan and it's something that I've always wanted to learn how to make for the blog! It was easy to satisfy those cravings with pop ups like @cenavegan and @vegatinos in the LA area, but after Chris and I moved to the Portland area last year, we couldn't find anything that compared 🙁 soooo we decided it was time to get cookin'.

We have been stressed about everything on our to do list latelyband I know it may seem a bit backwards to drop our responsibilities and just hang tf out for a bit but honestly sometimes you just have to take a step away from everything and RELAX to be able to come back and do things even better. You know what I mean? We’re back at it today and running lots of errands and cleaning lots of kalat (clutter) in the house but now I actually feel a bit excited about it 😂😛 #user_34

user_34;user_34194.jpg;Took this little booger out for the day and he did pretty dang good 🖤 I usually don’t talk about dog stuff but let’s talk about dog stuff. We rescued Berry after his family was abandoned in a trailer park in California and our # 1 goal has always been to give him the best life possible. And that doesn’t just mean showering him with treats and all the cuddles in the world, but it also means dedicating time and effort to helping him work through some problems and to become a more confident and less anxious/nervous pup. I’ve learned a lot about dogs in the last few years of being his mama and the best tips I can give you are 1. Remember that the energy you share with your pup is the most important tool you have. If you’re on edge when taking your dog out and about, your dog will feed off of that and think that they should be on edge, too. When we are calm and confident in Berry, he is usually calm and confident in himself. Patience is key!✨ 2. Celebrate the small wins your pup has each and every day 3. Work with someone who is as dedicated to your dog as you are. We had no idea where to start with little B and our friends @pasadenapaws, @oregontails and @packlife_la helped set the foundation for us. All three of them post a lot of helpful information and I definitely recommend you check them out 🐶 4. Consider getting a “do not pet” harness to put on your dog while you’re out working with them. It makes a huge difference and in our experience most people are respectful of it 🙏🏼 We have also just gotten used to letting people know Berry doesn’t like strangers coming up to him and he needs his space. It’s used to be awkward at first but I’m much more confident now as I know it will help Berry. 5. Lastly, stay consistent. It takes time and We still have a lot to work through with this guy, but he has made so much progress since we started! 🖤

It takes about 10 minutes to make and it’s light and fresh, so it won’t weigh you down and you can still party all night 😜⁣ Recipe is below and also on https://user_34.com/2019/06/maple-grilled-peaches/ ✨ ⁣ Ingredients⁣ * 3 peaches, halved and pitted* (see notes)⁣ * Maple syrup* (see notes)⁣ * 6 scoops vegan vanilla ice cream (we used So Delicious Cashew Vanilla)⁣ Toppings, such as⁣ * 6-Ingredient Stovetop Granola from user_34.com (or granola of your choice)⁣ * Maple syrup⁣ * Cinnamon⁣ * Salt⁣ * Candied pecans or nuts of your choice⁣ ⁣ Instructions⁣ 1. Oil the clean grill grates and set the grill to a medium heat.⁣ 2. Using a pastry brush, generously brush each side of the peaches with maple syrup.⁣ 3. Place the peaches cut-side down on the grill for about 3 to 5 minutes. Keep an eye on them to be sure that they do not burn. Flip the peaches and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender.⁣ 4. Remove the peaches from heat. You can either serve them right away or allow them to cool before serving.⁣ 5. Serve the peaches with toppings of your choice. We like to add a scoop or two of vegan vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of maple syrup, a sprinkle of both cinnamon and salt plus a handful of granola.⁣ ⁣ Notes⁣ * Be sure the peaches that you use are still firm when squeezed. * If you would like, you can brush the peaches with olive oil instead of maple syrup to decrease the sweetness of this recipe.⁣ * Grill the peaches over medium heat and grill them until tender but not mushy! You still want the peaches to hold their shape when serving.⁣ #vegan #user_34 #grilledpeaches
