user_25;user_2515.jpg;⁣ As a white person, it’s not my turn to speak out — it’s time to listen. That’s why I will be participating in the #AmplifyMelanatedVoices challenge this week.

However, I hope you choose to spend your time educating yourself, following BIPOC, and supporting our brothers in sisters in the best way you can. ⁣ ⁣ Swipe through this post to see the challenge, created by @blackandembodied and @jessicawilson.msrd 🤎 I also hope you will consider joining me, regardless of your follower count.

user_25;user_2516.jpg;Hi. I’m a food blogger, and I have directly benefited from white supremacy and racism. How? It’s a one word answer: privilege. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Have I worked hard to build my brand into a 6-figure business? Yes. ⁣⁣ Have I struggled? Yes.⁣⁣ Am I proud of my accomplishments? Hell yes. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ BUT 👉🏼👉🏽👉🏾⁣⁣ Have I ever had to worry about where my⁣⁣ next meal was coming from? No. ⁣⁣ Did I grow up in an unstable household? No.⁣⁣ Do I live in a marginalized body? No.⁣⁣ Have I ever been immediately judged based on the color of my skin? No. ⁣⁣ Have I had to continually witness the oppression, tokenization, and murder of my race? No. ⁣⁣ Have I had to endure some or all of the above WHILE growing up, building my business, or just living my life in general? No. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Just because you aren’t overtly racist doesn’t mean you haven’t been reaping the benefits of someone else’s oppression. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ When I take a look at all of my peers in this creative space, I can’t help but notice one thing: the most popular blogs seem to be run by white or white-passing women/men. There are COUNTLESS blogs run by POC who work just as hard (or harder) and have delicious recipes, stunning photography, and better videography than me. Why aren’t they as popular? I don’t have an answer. Do you? ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ So now I ask myself, why is my blog so successful? If I had a different skin color, would people (sub)consciously like me⁣⁣ less? Would social media algorithms and news feeds hide my content? ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Honestly, I’ve been struggling to work this week. Posting about food and new recipes seems a little trivial with everything that’s going on right now. But the more I think about it, the more I realize how food, race, and privilege are all connected. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ Something has to change. That something can start with you, simply by diversifying your feed, supporting other POC, and using whatever privilege you have to create space for others. Swipe for a guide by @goodgoodgoodco on how to be actively anti-racist. ⁣⁣ ⁣⁣ As a thin, cis-gendered, white woman who comes from a middle class family, I know that I need to step it up. To use my platform to elevate others. CONTD IN COMMENTS
