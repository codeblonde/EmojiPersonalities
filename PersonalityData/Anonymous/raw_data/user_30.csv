user_30;user_300.jpg;Nourishing myself and preparing myself for a really busy day tomorrow. 🙃 Luckily I have lots of leftovers of this red lentil chili remaining for lunch tomorrow to help fuel me. 😬 Will think happy thoughts and dream of chili for the time being. This chili is hearty and gets an extra kick from a little ginger and chipotle powder. 🙌🏽 . Red Lentil Chipotle Chili 1 cup green lentils 1 cup red lentils 1/2 red onion, diced 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato paste 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch fresh ginger, minced 2 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp chipotle powder 2 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin 2 tbsp maple syrup 4 cups vegetable broth Salt and pepper to taste . In a medium pot add onions and sauté until softened, 3 minutes. Add in red bell pepper, garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add in tomato paste and seasonings. Stir in pan for 2-3 minutes allowing them the become fragrant. Add tomatoes, lentils, maple syrup and vegetable broth. Stir to combine and bring to a boil, then reduce to a low heat and allow to cook for 30-40 minutes or until lentils are soft and tender and chili is thick. . If cooking in the instapot, set instapot to sauté and follow all steps as detailed above when adding ingredients. When all ingredients are in the instapot, seal the top and set it to manual pressure for 10 minutes. Allow for natural pressure release and stir pot well before serving. 🥣
user_30;user_301.jpg;So another secret. I’m not good at making overnight oats. 😌I guess let me clarify...I’m not good at making them “overnight” because I forget to set them the night before. 🤦🏽‍♀️ So I’ll typically make them morning of as soon as I wake up. I’ll grab a bowl or jar, add the ingredients and just let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes to an hour. Once I get hungry, just add my toppings and it’s perfect every time. 🤣 Why go through the trouble? It’s been hot here and the coolness of the oats is very inviting at the moment. But if you want them heated you can always heat them up in the microwave or in the stove top. 🙃 . Easy Overnight Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp chia seeds 3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk 1/4 tsp cinnamon Pinch of nutmeg 1 mashed medjool date or 1 tsp maple syrup Pinch of salt . Stir all ingredients together and allow to sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. Give a good stir before serving. Feel free to top with fruit of choice. I went with maple caramel almond butter from @georgiagrinders, strawberries, diced banana, and cacao nibs. 🍓
user_30;user_302.jpg;I know I cook a lot of chickpeas, but I love chickpeas and these mustard chili chickpeas were so lovely. 🌶 Just paired it with some plantains, avocado, cauliflower and greens. 🥣 . Catching up with comments and messages. Apologies for being slightly MIA. I’ve felt overwhelmed and needed a mini break for my brain. Thank you for your patience everyone! 🌻 . Mustard Chili Chickpeas 1 small onion, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced 1 stalk celery, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsp soy sauce 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning 1 tsp sazón (or an extra tsp of chili powder) 2 tsp chili powder 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 2 cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained 2 tsp brown mustard 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water 2 tsp sugar or maple syrup Salt and pepper to taste . Heat a medium pan over medium heat, add diced onion, bell pepper and celery. Sauté to, allowing onion to become translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add in garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add in seasonings and sauté for 1 minute then stir in soy sauce. Add chickpeas and mustard and sauté to coat. Add sugar and broth and stir to combine. Allow to simmer for about 8-10 minutes or until chickpeas are coated. Salt and pepper to taste then serve. ❤️
user_30;user_303.jpg;Happy Sunday to everyone! 🌞Starting my day off with a bowl of snickerdoodle oatmeal because I needed that comfort. ✨Obviously you need that cinnamon sugar combo, but to make it a little richer, making this with a spoon of cashew butter (@georgiagrinders) was everything. 🔥 . SNICKERDOODLE OATMEAL Cinnamon Sugar Topping 1 tsp sugar Pinch of cinnamon . Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flax seed 1 tsp sugar Pinch of salt 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 cup unsweetened almond milk 1 tbsp cashew butter . In a small bowl, combine pinch of cinnamon and 1 tsp of sugar and set aside. Add oats, ground flax seed, remaining tsp of sugar, cinnamon and salt to a sauce pan and stir to combine. Stir in cashew butter, vanilla extract and almond milk. Turn heat on and bring mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, begin to stir oatmeal and continue to slowly stir for about 3-5 minutes or until oats have thickened as desired. Remove oats from stove top and pour into serving bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar mixture over top surface of oatmeal and top with fruit if desired. . No cashew butter or allergy? Opt for another nut butter that suits your needs. Almond butter, tahini or sunflower seed butter works too. 🌻
user_30;user_304.jpg;I would say that a good majority of my meals are 100% random. 🥴 I just like too many things not to include them. At least for me it tastes good, and that’s all I’m concerned with. If you’re not enjoying what you’re eating, then what is the point? 🙃 This bowl includes some @lotusfoods rice ramen that I cooked and tossed with soy sauce and sriracha and a small amount of coconut milk (no seasoning packet was used for this), edamame, spring onions, baked BBQ tempeh, and baked gochujang cauliflower bites. 🌶 . If you aren’t sure what gochujang is, it’s a really flavorful and spicy, fermented red pepper paste (there are other ingredients mixed in as well). I remember the first time I purchased some, I was in H-Mart and a really kind Korean woman saw me staring endlessly at all the various pastes. She stopped what she was doing and was so excited to explain all the different pastes to me. She was so passionate about it and in turn it made me super passionate about it too. Always check ingredients to make sure it’s vegan, but other then that definitely enjoy if you get your hands on it. If you don’t have access to it, you can also sub in some sriracha (the flavor is not the same as sriracha is more garlic forward). 🥣 I am not an expert on Korean food, so highly recommend you also looking into this information from others that are more knowledgeable like @the.korean.vegan. . Gochujang Flavored Cauliflower Bites 1/2 a head of cauliflower, cut into 1 inch bites . Batter 1/4 cup flour 1 tbsp soy sauce Pinch of salt Pinch of pepper 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp dry basil 1 tsp paprika 1/2 to 3/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk . Sauce 1 tbsp tahini 1 tsp gochujang Splash of soy sauce Pinch of garlic Pinch of salt 3 tbsp water . Preheat oven to 425F. In a bowl combine batter ingredients and whisk together until smooth (you don’t want it to be too watery, so start with 1/2 cup liquid and if you need it thinner add a little bit more at a time). Add cauliflower to bowl and toss together to coat. Take each individual piece and shake off excess batter and place on a lined baking sheet and pop in the oven for 15-20 minutes.

user_30;user_305.jpg;🍓 Red is pretty. It’s also a very powerful color that is linked to the celebration of Juneteenth. 🍉Red foods, that beautiful crimson color is a symbol of ingenuity and resilience in bondage. 🍎It’s also deeper than that as it goes to its origin roots in West Africa as a symbol of strength, spirituality, and life and death. 🍒 And the foods used to celebrate on this day hold a lot of symbolic meaning and connects those today to those in past generations. Together, this day and the food helps to “reunite people, renew family ties and friendships, and affirm their humanity.” -Christina year Djossa (How Red Food and Drink Joined the Juneteenth Feast)✨ . To celebrate, I’m feasting on these fresh strawberries along with some caramelized bananas, cashew butter, cacoa nibs over this vanilla cardamom oats. 🍓Remember, we all still lots of work left to do, so don’t get complacent. . Vanilla Cardamom Oats 1/3 cup cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flaxseed 1/2 diced banana Pinch of cinnamon 1 cup boiling hot water Pinch of cardamom 1/2 tsp vanilla extract Pinch salt . In a bowl, add oats, flax, salt, cinnamon, cardamom and vanilla. Stir to combine and then add in hot water. Cover bowl with a plate and allow to sit for 1-2 minutes to thicken. Once thickened add diced banana and mix well to help enhance creaminess. Top with strawberries and extra toppings as desired. 🍓
user_30;user_306.jpg;Kind of talked about this salad briefly in my stories. ✨ Got some greens, cilantro, corn, cherry tomatoes, fajita tempeh, cucumber, some baked tortilla strips and some @88acres Smoky Chipotle dressing. 🌶Have been using more tempeh recently because I’m mildly obsessed with it. 🤣 . Fajita Tempeh Bites 1 block of tempeh, cubed 1 cup veggie broth 1 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 1/2 tsp fajita seasoning 1 tsp sriracha 2 tsp soy sauce . Set oven to 400F. Add all ingredients to a pan and bring to a simmer. Allow tempeh to cook and marinade in broth until most of liquid cooks off. Place bites onto lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. You can also place the tempeh in an airfrier at 370F for 5 minutes. . For the salad, I made my own tortilla strips and just baked them for about 3 minutes in the oven with the tempeh. 🌻
user_30;user_307.jpg;Every week I order cauliflower and I can see the internal groan that shows up in my husband’s eyes. 😭😂 He’s not the biggest fan of cauliflower or broccoli, but I consider them both necessary staples. To help encourage him to eat it, I find smothering it with tahini and different spices tends to do the trick. 🙃 If you ever want to encourage or broaden someone’s palate, smother it in sauce. Make it a positive experience for them and they might change their mind over time. Even if they don’t ever like it plain, you can proudly state that you at least got them to eat their veg. 🤣 . Cauliflower Steak 1 head of cauliflower 2 tbsp tahini or nut butter of preference*** 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp garlic powder 2-3 tbsp water Salt and pepper to taste 🙌🏽 . Set oven to 425F. Cut cauliflower head into 3-4 even slabs. Add all remaining ingredients except cauliflower into a bowl and whisk together. Brush the cauliflower with the mixture on both sides. When completed, place in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Then set oven to high broil and allow to cook for an additional 5-8 minutes or until edges are golden. Allow to cool for at least 5 mins before serving. . *** Tahini is a fav and I have my preference. Used @soomfoods tahini for its smoothness and flavor. I have a discount code for them in my profile along with other fun resources. :)
user_30;user_308.jpg;Okay, 2 things! 🌻 . ☝🏽Hi, hello, you say you have nut allergies? Well, I just tried out something I was gifted by @kweenandco, granola butter, and it is absolutely delicious. Includes healthy fats (no nuts or seeds), low sugar, is runny, main ingredient is gluten free oats and tastes like if you turned Teddy Grahams into a nut butter spread. ✨ . ✌🏽I hear you my friends who dislike bananas. I have a new oatmeal recipe sans banana, hoping it can give you some ideas of how to upgrade your oatmeal bowls. 🥣 . Maple Pear Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp flax seed 1 finely diced pear 1-2 tsp maple syrup Pinch of salt Pinch of cinnamon 1 cup unsweetened almond milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Stir as oats cook allowing to thicken over a few minutes. Once at desired consistency, pour oats out to serve and top with fruit and any extra spreads. Today I went with mango, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and some granola butter. 🥣
user_30;user_309.jpg;I had a long day, but during this long day I had a great conversation with another Hispanic, and after talking to her and making her more comfortable about eating tortillas and beans...I found myself really craving some stewed pinto beans. Normally when I’m with my mom, we’ll just say Habichuelas. ✨ Habichuelas Guisadas is just so good, and my mom makes them perfect every time. She’ll cook them all day, but I just don’t have the time to do the same. So I cheat a little bit and use a pressure cooker to help. 👏🏽 . Habichuelas Guisadas 1 lb dry pinto beans Water 1 tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp dry thyme 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning 2 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp sazón (@eatloisa)** 1 jalapeño, diced 1 small red onion, diced 2 tbsp soy sauce 5 mushrooms, sliced (optional) 5 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsp nutritional yeast Salt and pepper to taste . Add the beans to your instant pot insert and pour in enough fresh water to cover the beans by 1 inch. Allow to soak for at least 8 hours or over night. Rinse and drain water and then add fresh water back into the chamber, enough to cover the beans by 1 inch. Place into pressure cooker and set to manual and cook for 25 minutes and release pressure naturally. While pressure releases sauté onions in a separate pan with jalapeño and mushrooms until onions are translucent. Add in garlic and sauté until fragrant. Open instant pot remove and dump 1 cup of the cooking liquid out. Add in sautéed onion mixture along with all other seasonings and yeast. Hit the sauté button on the instant pot and allow mixture to come to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Stir on occasion until stew has thickened. You can help stew thicken more by lightly mashing the beans. Adjust salt. 🥣 . If you want to use canned beans, use 3 cans of pinto beans. Rinse and drain them and set aside. In a large pot add veggies and garlic as described and sauté as directed above. Add beans, soy, tomato paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add in seasonings, yeast and then add 3 1/2 cups low sodium vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer and cook on low for 25-30 minutes. With a back of cooking spoon, lightly mash some of the beans to help thicken the stew. Adjust salt. 🥑
user_30;user_3010.jpg;I’m definitely not a baker, but I like baked things. 👏🏽Being stuck at home has made me want to experiment with some fun easy recipes. 🥣One that I was working on for the longest time was this mug brownie. Cooks up in the microwave for 45 seconds and gets an extra chocolate flavor boost by adding a little splash of coffee. ☕️ I included a lot of details on ingredient swaps (gluten free option) and included oven instructions in case you don’t have a microwave. ✨ For more brownie fun, I added a scoop of vanilla @cadoicecream and it just was the best thing ever. 🤤 . Easy Vegan Mug Brownie 1 1/2 tbsp white wheat flour 1 1/2 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp cocoa powder Pinch salt 2 tbsp peanut butter 2 tbsp almond milk 1 tbsp brewed coffee 1 tbsp of chocolate chips or more if desired . In a mug, add all dry ingredients and stir with a fork. Add in peanut butter, coffee and almond milk then carefully stir with fork to create a wet batter. Carefully fold in chocolate chips. Feel free to top with additional chocolate chips or fold more in for extra fudginess. Place mug in the microwave for 45 seconds. Make sure to allow mug cake to rest and cool for a few minutes before enjoying.
user_30;user_3011.jpg;A while ago I asked you guys, which pulses (beans/lentils) you wanted me to make more recipes for. ❤️ Overwhelmingly, a lot of you wanted more ways to enjoy lentils. So here’s another flavor profile for you using some petite lentils. Also, if you are wondering why there is an uptick in ginger in my recipes it’s because I literally have a medium sized paper bag of them in my fridge and I’m determined to use all of it. 😂 Served these lentils with purple Brussels sprouts (yes they are real), brown rice and avocado. 🥑 . Saucy Ginger Lentils 1/2 small onion, diced 1 jalapeño, diced (de-seed if you don’t like spice) Red bell pepper, de-seed and diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch fresh ginger, minced 1 tbsp tomato paste 1/8 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp sazón or packet (I used @eatloisa) 1 cup lentils (I used French lentils in particular for this dish, make sure to rinse well) 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth or water 1 tbsp tahini Salt to taste . Start by sautéing diced onions in a medium sauce pan over low medium heat until translucent. Add in garlic and ginger and continuously sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 2 tbsp water to deglaze the pan and add in diced bell pepper, jalapeño, and tomato paste. Sauté for 30 seconds and then add in all dry seasonings. Continue to sauté until you smell the cinnamon bloom then add rinsed lentils. Add broth, stir to combine and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, cook for 5 minutes and reduce heat to a simmer. Allow lentils to cook covered for about 15-20 minutes, allowing broth to begin thickening. Remove lid and add tahini. Stir well and if desired continue cooking until lentils are at desired consistency. I cooked them to the point they were more saucy. If you want more of a stew, feel free to add an additional 1/2 cup of water to loosen them up. Adjust salt to your preference and serve. 🥣
user_30;user_3012.jpg;In need of a good sleep in tomorrow. Happy Friday everyone. 🌞Needed a bit of rejuvenation after these last few weeks and this salad did that for me. Here are the deets for this bowl and if you’d like the dressing recipe, you can find it on my blog 👇🏽 . Massaged kale, diced up Boca spicy chik’n patty, roasted beets, cucumber and my ginger green goddess dressing. 🥒 The kale was massaged in a few tbsp of the dressing. 🥗Massaging your greens might sound weird, but it helps makes the greens tastier and easier to digest. Rub the greens between your fingers with some salt, acid and fat to help break down some of the fibers in the greens to make them softer and easier to digest. 🥣 Takes a few minutes, but you’ll notice your greens start to shrink in size and it makes kale taste amazing. 🥬 . Ginger Green Goddess Dressing 1 small avocado, pit removed and scoped out of skin 1 tbsp nutritional yeast 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, packed 1 spring onion, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic 1 inch fresh ginger 1 tbsp yellow mustard 2 tsp maple syrup Juice of 1 lime Zest of 1 lime (optional) Salt to taste 3/4 cup water . Add all ingredients in the order listed to a blender or food processor. Set to blend on high speed until completely smooth. If too thick for your liking, adjust water by adding 2 tbsp at a time to the dressing and blending again. Once dresing is to your liking, pour dressing into a resealable container and place in fridge to completely cool before using. Dressing will keep for 4 days in the refridgerator. 🥬🥗
user_30;user_3013.jpg;Strawberries and chocolate are just a match made in heaven. 🍓🍫This bowl wasn’t made on the stovetop and was still fast and easy for a busy day like today. 🥣 Enjoyed the bowl with some plums and strawberries and cacao nibs. 🌻 .

user_30;user_3014.jpg;Hello. My name is Catherine and I am in love with broccoli and tofu. Nice to meet you. 😂 Some of my meals might have similar elements to them, but that makes making dinners through out the week much easier. If you’re reading this caption, what meals do you always have on rotation at home? 🌻 . Today, to keep with our typical noodle meal of the week, I made some Thai curry noodles and sriracha baked tofu. Paired those with some greens and sautéed mushrooms and broccoli. 🥦 . Sriracha Tofu 1 block extra firm tofu, drained and pressed then cut into cubes 2 tsp sriracha 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp nutritional yeast Juice of half a lime . Set oven to 400F. If you aren’t sure what pressing your tofu means, do a quick search for pressing tofu in google or head over to my blog for instructions. Once pressed, cube and add tofu to a large tupperware container. Top with soy sauce, sriracha, and nutritional yeast. Seal container and give a few gentle shakes to help coat tofu in mixture. Place tofu on a baking tray and make sure tofu is spread out and not touching. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Squeeze lime over top before serving. . Curry Ramen Noodles 2 blocks rice ramen noodles (@lotusfoods) 2 tsp soy sauce 2 tbsp canned coconut milk/or 2 tsp oil of choice 1 tsp Thai curry paste 1 tsp sriracha Juice of half a lime Salt to taste .

user_30;user_3015.jpg;Hrmmm...I’ve been baking a lot recently. 🥣 While I’m not a seasoned baker, I love playing around with different recipes. These blondies are sneaky just like my brownies and have beans in them, chickpeas specifically. I promise, they don’t taste like chickpeas at all! Probably closer to a chocolate chip cookie if anything. Easy to put together and super yummy. Hoping you all are having a good day. ✨ . Chickpea Blondies 1/2 cup rolled oats 2 tbsp coconut sugar OR brown sugar 1 tsp baking powder 1/4 tsp salt 1 can chickpeas (rinsed and drained) 1/2 cup maple syrup 1 tsp vanilla (optional) 1/4 cup peanut butter (swap for a seed butter if dealing with allergies) 1/3 cup dairy free chocolate chips + more to top with as desired 🥜 . Set oven to 350F. Place all oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt into the food processor and process it into a flour. Add in chickpeas and remaining liquid ingredients except chocolate chips into the food processor and process until batter is smooth. Scrap down sides to allow even blending. Once smooth, fold in chocolate chips. Spoon out mixture on to a 8x8 baking tray and place in the oven for 20 minutes. Allow blondies to completely cool before cutting into them.
user_30;user_3016.jpg;Dinner from tonight. 💜 Made a different variation of the baked tempeh from the other day but cut it into chunks and paired with some avocado, greens, @lotusfoods brown rice pad Thai noodles and some baked purple cauliflower. 🥬 After cooking the noodles just drizzled with a mix of some lime juice, maple syrup, and soy sauce. 🥣 .

user_30;user_3017.jpg;The weekends just can’t be weekends without pancakes. 🥞 And the peaches and nectarines this year have been out of this world yummy. 🍑Whenever they are this sweet, I always make it a point to grill some. They soften into the most gooey and decadent topping. Always worth it and it just made sense to me to add them to these pancakes. 🍽 . Coconut Peach Pancakes 1 ripe banana 1 tbsp ground flax seeds 2 tbsp water 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp salt 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp baking soda 1 tbsp sugar or maple syrup 1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour 1 1/4 cups coconut milk beverage (not canned) 2 tbsp coconut flakes 1 peach or nectarine, diced . Grilled Peaches 2 peaches/nectarines 1 tbsp maple syrup Pinch cinnamon Pinch nutmeg . Preheat a griddle/grill or pan. In a mixing bowl, add banana and with a whisk or fork mash banana until mostly smooth. Add in flax seed and water and give mixture a good stir and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Next add in apple cider vinegar, vanilla, salt, and sugar and mix this in well. Add in baking soda and baking powder. Stir well again and you will notice the mixture react and start to fluff up. Add in flour, coconut flakes and milk and mix to form a thick batter (avoid over mixing). Fold in peaches into the batter. When griddle is ready, scoop 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto griddle surface and cook for 2-3 minutes or until bottom of pancake is golden. Flip and cook other side for 2-3 minutes as well. Remove from heat and eat. 🥞 . While pancakes are cooking, combine sliced peaches, maple syrup, cinnamon and nutmeg. Toss to coat and then add to preheated grill. Grill for about 3-4 minutes or until grill marks start to appear and then flip to cook for an additional 3 minutes. Serve immediately with pancakes. :)
user_30;user_3018.jpg;Had some left over coconut milk, so felt inclined to make a different curry inspired dish. 😌 This one has both tofu and lentils. Of course I had to pair this with some rice, broccoli and boiled plantains. 👏🏽 And for many of you that are new, if you have no idea what plantains are, here’s a brief run down. You might see these as bananas, but plantains are meant to be cooked. You can find both starchy and sweet varieties (green to yellowish/black respectively). A major staple in many cultures from Africa to the Caribbean islands and Central/South America. There are many ways to cook these and I have a few tutorials in my highlights about them if you ever want to experiment. 🙃 Anyway, on to this tasty dish.👇🏽 . Curried Tofu And Lentils 1/2 medium red onion, diced 1/2 green bell pepper, diced 1 small sweet potato, cubed 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch ginger, minced 1 tbsp tomato paste 1 tbsp curry powder 1 tsp cumin 2 tsp smoked paprika 1 15 oz can diced fire roasted tomatoes 1 cup green lentils 1 cup light or full fat coconut milk 1 block super firm tofu, cubed 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth . Stove Top Instructions Heat up your pan to medium heat and saute onion and green peppers until onion is translucent. Add in sweet potato, ginger and garlic and make sure to continue moving them around the pan to prevent them from burning. Add tomato paste along with spices and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in lentils, diced tomatoes, coconut milk, give a good stir to fully combine. Gently fold in tofu along with vegetable broth. Bring mixture to a boil and then immediately reduce to a low simmer and allow to cook for 25-30 minutes or until lentils are tender. . Instant Pot Instructions Set Instant Pot to saute. Follow all instructions as you would if cooking on stove top. Once you've added the vegetable broth, switch Instant Pot to manual high pressure. Set timer to 13 minutes and make sure lid is set to seal. Allow pressure to release naturally. Remove lid and serve curry as desired.
user_30;user_3019.jpg;Don’t forget to take care of yourself. 🖤 I’ve seen too many posts of people not getting enough sleep, dealing with emotional stress and even not having the appetite to eat. This week has been emotionally traumatic and I don’t blame anyone for doing any of these things. It’s very easy to forget about taking care of yourself in these times. I caught myself early this week skipping meals, not sleeping, and just dealing with high levels of anxiety. 💆🏽‍♀️I can’t be an effective advocate or counselor if I’m not taking care of myself, so since Wednesday I got back into a better routine as hard as it was.

user_30;user_3020.jpg;While the kitchen is my therapy room, it’s also not a place I have the time to spend all day in. 💆🏽‍♀️So making fast dishes is essential for me as my time is especially precious these days.

user_30;user_3021.jpg;Reasons I love food. 🥣 Food identifies us, connects us, tells stories, can be shared, can be expressive and ultimately sustains us. The more we look to diversify our food space, the more we can connect and learn from each other. ❤️ One of the reasons I became a dietitian was because I didn’t feel represented, so I did something about it. However, POC are still very much under represented even still as I approach my 6th year as a dietitian. There are many reasons for this. Becoming a dietitian is tough. It will soon be required to obtain a masters degree (it means we’re educated but that’s...💸💸), you need to do an UNPAID internship (often for 6-12 months 💸💸), and pay for the exam...it’s an investment. Many people can’t afford to do 6-12 months of unpaid labor. We need more POC in the health and wellness space. It almost feels like an exclusive club that only certain people have access to. But this space needs to be easier to access because us POC have fantastic and flavorful things to share. 🙋🏽‍♀️ .

I stand with you as a Latina. . For those of you ready to say “all lives matter” or call those protesting “thugs”, take a moment and think of those currently being oppressed. They are people. They have NAMES. They have families and loved ones. Some will never see their loved ones again due to unnecessary police brutality. The people that protest are doing it because they are scared for their lives. They are trying to vocalize their anxiety, sadness, and fear. They want to be heard and treated equally. They don’t want to die. We need compassion more than ever. We need to listen and not just turn up our nose to these issues. .

user_30;user_3027.jpg;Things are definitely feeling a bit nutty these days. 🤪 For those types of days I roll with it, making sure to give myself a point of self care and to also serve myself something yummy...usually always something involving noodles, tofu and peanut sauce for those particularly stressful days. 🥜 . Bowl>>> Includes a serving of @lotusfoods moringa pad Thai noodles, broccoli, cabbage, onions and baked tofu. Coated everything in my peanut sauce and then drizzled some extra sauce overtop. 🥣 . Peanut Sauce 3 tbsp natural peanut butter 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (opt for gluten free soy sauce or coconut aminos to make gluten free) 1 tbsp maple syrup 1 tsp sriracha 1 tsp mustard 1/4 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp ginger powder Juice of half a lime 2-3 tbsp water .

user_30;user_3028.jpg;Are you a tofu scramble anytime of the day person? 💁🏽‍♀️ I know I M and currently dreaming of the weekend when I had some of this fluffy tofu scramble and avocado toast for a late lunch. 🤤 Honestly, tofu scramble is not just a breakfast option and I’ll gladly have this with a bowl of rice and avocado and call it a day too. 👏🏽 No matter what time tho, having a fluffy go to breakfast scramble is needed.

Fluffy Tofu Scramble 1/2 small onion, diced 1 block firm or extra firm tofu, drained 2 tsp nutritional yeast 1 tsp dry oregano 1/2 tsp dry thyme 1/8 tsp turmeric (if you like turmeric, feel free to add more) 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp garlic chili sauce (or sriracha—optional) 1 heaping tbsp of tahini 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk Salt and pepper to taste . Heat up a pan to medium heat. If using a normal pan, add a tsp of oil to prevent sticking or use a nonstick pan to do this oil free. Add in onion and sauté until translucent. Crumble tofu with hands into the pan, leave some bigger chunks if desired. Add in soy sauce and all dry spices, herbs and nutritional yeast and stir to combine. Allow everything to cook and become fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add in tahini, garlic chili sauce and milk. Bring eggs to a low simmer while continuously stirring. Allow tofu to cook and absorb liquid for about 3-5 minutes or until tofu looks fluffy. The tofu should have a slightly runny consistency like eggs tend to have when cooking. Remove from heat and serve tofu as desired. 🥑

Place tray in the oven and bake brownies for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting.
user_30;user_3032.jpg;I made these peanut miso chickpeas earlier this week and got a lot of questions about them. 👌🏽 These chickpeas are so yum, and I’ve been making this creamy bowl at least once a week recently. 🥣 I just posted about them on the blog so if you need to bookmark, feel free to do so (I also really appreciate it as I’ve been putting an effort in uploading them more frequently—you can find a link to them in my profile). 🙃 On to the yum.

user_30;user_3037.jpg;Happy Monday, friends! 💫 It’s overnight oats season. And as I transition to mostly colder oats, I still like those cooked elements wherever I can stick them. 🍌You can definitely put your oats in the microwave for a minute to warm up, but I’ve become a huge fan of just cooking some fruit and topping the bowl that way. Sweet and delicious. 👏🏽 Here are the oats I’m rocking today. 🥣 . Overnight Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp chia seeds or ground flax seeds 1 tsp sweetener of your choice or 1 mashed medjool date Pinch of cardamom Pinch of cinnamon Pinch of salt 1 banana 3/4 cup unsweetened plant milk (I used almond milk) . Combine all ingredients together and set overnight in the fridge. You can leave it in a bowl, place in Tupperware container or do whatever fancy thing you like to do with your oats. 🙂 Whenever you are ready to serve, add your banana in and mash lightly into oats. Just top with your favorite fruit and eat it. 👏🏽 . For the apples, dice up an apple and sauté with 2 tsp liquid sweetener and a pinch cinnamon and a splash of water. Allow apples to soften over a low medium heat and then use to top over oatmeal. Added just a little sprinkle of pepitas and cacao nibs for crunch. So good. 🍎
user_30;user_3038.jpg;I feel like I had a legit blast from the past this morning. ☀️ Tried recreating a consistent staple meal, which growing up was a plate of mashed plantains and fried salami (salchichón). 🥬 I replaced the salami with breakfast sausage from @gardein. Oddly enough it has such a shockingly close taste to it that my eyes kind of just lit up. It made me want to make this dish so bad. 🤩 . >>> Plantains: Cut off ends of a green plantain and take knife and run along length of skin to open. Use thumb to open seem and pull peel away from the flesh of the plantain. Once skin is removed, cut plantain into quarters and place in boiling salted water for about 8-10 minutes. Plantains will start to turn more yellow in color as they cook. Remove from heat and keep plantains in cooking water until ready to use. You can cut plantain into smaller bite size pieces or mash with a few spoonfuls of cooking water and mash to desired consistency. Top with some sautéed onions. 👌🏽 . >>> Sautéed Kale: Take 5-6 ribs of kale and remove the leaves from stem. Rinse well and squeeze away excess water. With hands, rip into bite size pieces. In a pan, add 3 cloves worth of minced garlic. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add kale along with 1/2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp nutritional yeast. Sauté on low medium heat until kale wilts and starts turning a bright green. Kale should be fully cooked in about 5-10 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside. 🥬 . >>> Extra pieces: Cook vegan sausage patty according to instructions. Sauté onion with a lit salt until softened. Cut up some avocado to serve with it. . Assemble and serve your portions and enjoy. 🤗 Also really good if served with tofu scramble. 😍 At some point I will be making my own breakfast sausage to try and mimic this epicness. Work in progress. 👌🏽
user_30;user_3039.jpg;I think I like this granola the most when I make it with tahini. 🙇🏽‍♀️I like how it balances out the sweet of the maple.

Cinnamon Peanut Butter Granola 2 cups rolled oats 1/4 cup peanut butter (make sure it’s runny) 1/4 cup maple syrup (you can use more if you like your granola more sweet) 1 tsp cinnamon 2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp salt or more to taste Optional: add in cacao nibs, pepitas or raisins . Add oats to a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Stir and toast oats for about 1-2 minutes. Add in seasonings and salt and toss to combine then add in remaining ingredients. Lower heat slightly, and continue to stir to prevent granola from burning for about 5-6 minutes. Lower heat again to low and allow to continue toasting while stirring for an additional 3-5 minutes. Granola should have a toasted golden color to them. Remove from heat and allow granola to completely cool before storing. Granola will continue to crisp up as it cools. But also really good hot off the stove too.
user_30;user_3045.jpg;I kept telling Greg I would make these pizza pinwheels one day, so I did about 2 weekends ago. 🍕And he’s been all about them ever since. Literally he asks me to make them twice every weekend. 😂 The first time I made these, I thought they would be a flop because we had no yeast to make dough. Whelp, didn’t seem to be a problem! 💯 . These pinwheels are pretty simple and very easy to modify. I used some meatless meatballs for these, made my own pizza sauce with tomato paste, and topped with some vegan cheese. If you swipe to the last photo, I actually made a version today that was stuffed with lentils, kale and vegan cheese. For full details for how to make the dough and sauce, it’s in my latest blog post. 💻 . Pizza Pinwheels 1 pizza dough (made my own, no yeast needed) 1/3 cup pizza sauce (I made my own) 6 frozen meatballs (I used Gardein) 1/2 cup shredded vegan cheese . Set oven to 375F. Prepare meatballs according to the package and then chop into small pieces. Taking your pizza dough, place dough on a smooth surface and flatten dough with a rolling pin to form a thin rectangular dough. Evenly, spread pizza sauce over the top of the flattened dough. Sprinkle meatballs and cheese evenly over top of the dough. Starting at one end of the long side of the dough, carefully start pinching and rolling dough into a tight log like you would a cinnamon roll. Once fully rolled, cut the roll into 6 equal pizza rolls. Place rolls in rows of two in a bread pan. Place pan into the oven for 20 minutes. Remove pan from oven and sprinkle an additional handful of cheese over top. Place pan back into the oven for another 5 minutes to allow cheese to melt. Remove pan from oven and allow to set for 5 minutes. Cut pieces out to serve with extra pizza sauce.
user_30;user_3046.jpg;Condolences to all of you who have had a disappointing salad in the past. 🥺No one should ever have to go through that and this is why I wrote a post all about it on the blog. 🥗 Full break down of how to make a yummy salad, which includes this beauty I enjoyed for lunch the other day. It includes baked tempeh, baked purple potatoes, massages kale, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and the most amazing chili lime tahini dressing. This is definitely a salad I will likely remake again and again because it was that yummy. 🤤 All details included on the blog. . Chili Lime Tahini Dressing 2 tbsp tahini (I used @soomfoods) 1/2 tsp chili lime seasoning 2 tsp maple syrup Juice of 1 lime 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast 2-3 tbsp water . In a bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk to fully combine until smooth. Adjust water until you achieve your desired consistency. 🥣 . To assemble your salad, take 2 tbsp of dressing and add to some de stemmed kale and massage dressing into greens. Massage greens until leaves are bright green and have shrunken in size, about 2-3 minutes. Top kale with some plant protein (I used tempeh), extra veggies, some starch (I used a small roasted potato, but grains lime quinoa and rice work too), cilantro, and top with dressing. You can add other items too like different nuts and seeds for more crunch. I ran out of a few toppings, but this salad was still super filling and satisfying. 🥗
user_30;user_3047.jpg;Pasta Friday, we meet again. 🙇🏽‍♀️ Not even mad because this pasta was yummy. Instead of using a bean based pasta, just added white beans to it. Both the pasta and beans are covered in a spicy red sauce. 💁🏽‍♀️ . Pasta with Spicy Red Sauce 2 cups cooked/canned white beans, rinsed and drained 1 6oz can of tomato paste 1/2 an onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp white balsamic vinegar 1 tsp dry basil 1/2 tsp dry oregano 1 tsp smoked paprika 1/2 to 1 tsp crushed red pepper 1 tbsp nutritional yeast 2 tsp brown sugar 1 cup vegetable broth 4 servings pasta 1/2 cup pasta water 1/4 tsp salt . In a sauce pan, add onion and sauté u TIL translucent. Add in garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add in tomato paste, oregano, basil and smoked paprika and stir while cooking for about 1-2 minutes. Add in white beans, sugar and broth and allow to cook and thicken for about 5 minutes on low medium heat. Add in balsamic vinegar and nutritional yeast and stir to combine. Allow to sit on low heat while you prepare the pasta (at this time you can also add greens like spinach in to wilt). Prepare pasta according to package. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water prior to draining pasta. Once pasta is drained add pasta to the sauce along with pasta water and salt. Stir to combine and allow to thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and serve. 🥣
user_30;user_3048.jpg;Had a little too much fun with colors at the moment. 🌈 Flavored my rice as it cooked with some adobo seasoning and a pinch of turmeric—now it’s bright yellow. Got some purple brussel sprouts and they remained so lovely and purple while they cooked. 💜And the star of my plate was this chili lime tofu. 🙌🏽 . Chili Lime Tofu 1 block extra firm tofu 2 tbsp soy sauce 1/2 tsp chili powder Pinch of garlic powder Zest of one lime Juice of 1/2 a lime Pinch of salt 1 tsp nutritional yeast 1 tsp maple syrup . Preheat oven to 400F. Remove block of tofu from packaging. Drain and press excess liquid with either a tofu press or wrap tofu in a few paper towels and place a heavy object over top to remove excess. Once tofu is drained, chop tofu into cubes and set aside. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a Tupperware container. Add tofu, seal container and shake together. Feel free to bake right away or marinade for an hour before baking. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until edges of tofu start to crisp up. Serve and enjoy. 💯
user_30;user_3049.jpg;Sweet or savory snacks? 🤔 Snacking has inevitably been coming up a lot during sessions I’ve had with people. My favorite snack right now is apple slices with peanut butter, but for many sometimes that doesn’t cut it. Here’s a quick and fun snack idea you can customize to your preference. A fruit roll up if you will. 🤣 . Fruit Roll Up 1 whole grain wrap 1 serving of fruit of choice 1 tbsp peanut butter Add Ins: chopped nuts, seeds, date syrup, chocolate chips, granola, etc. . Take your wrap and spread with peanut butter. Add fruit towards one end of the wrap plus any extra bits like nuts, seeds, or granola and roll it like you would a sushi roll. Eat as is or cut into individual pieces to enjoy. 🍌 . You can also do the same with some savory options. Spread hummus on a wrap and load up with greens, avocado, tofu, and rolls up. 🙌🏽
user_30;user_3050.jpg;I know most people have taken on bread making, but ever think to make your own tortillas? 🌮 This taco Tuesday is a special one considering its Cinco de Mayo. It only seemed appropriate that I try to make everything from scratch. It’s what I deserve. 🤣 And making it wasn’t really hard either. I know a lot of people might not be into making their own tortillas from scratch, but making sure you load up your tacos right is a must. 🌮 . Favorite taco filling at the moment are some black beans, corn, tomato, avocado, romaine, chili lime seasoning and some lime juice. 🤤You can find my super easy bean recipe below. ❤️ . Seasoned black beans 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp minced garlic 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning Pinch of onion powder 2 tbsp water 1 tbsp favorite hot sauce or bbq sauce🌶 . Add black beans, seasonings and water to a pan and set to low heat. When beans are heated through and most of the water is gone, turn off heat and coat beans with hot sauce. 😁
user_30;user_3051.jpg;Just had the leftovers for this bowl and it’s just as good if not better. 😋I’m such a huge fan of lentils. From their nutrition to how quick they cook, I can’t get enough. 🙌 These lentils are seasoned with adobo. Can’t help it. Adobo makes everything taste really good. 😆 Served this with rice, corn, avocado and a squeeze of lime. Not pictured was the broccoli I made, but had a bowl of that to the side. 🥦 . Adobo Lentils 1 cup dry green lentils 1 small potato, diced (optional) 1 small onion, diced 1 tsp adobo seasoning or to taste 1 tsp cumin 1 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp oregano 3 cups vegetable broth 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 bell pepper or roasted bell pepper, diced Bunch of cilantro with stems, roughly chopped . Sauté onions until softened in a large sauce pan. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add spices, potatoes, bell pepper, and lentils and stir well for at least 1 minute. Add in broth, stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover with a lid and allow lentils to cook for at least 30 minutes or when lentils are tender. Remove lid and stir in cilantro. Serve with rice. 🍚
user_30;user_3052.jpg;New mug cake, but now in the form of cinnamon rolls. 😋 Much faster than traditional rolls and cooks in the microwave in about a minute. 🥣 Note, these are fun and not meant to taste as decadent as a real Cinnabon, but still yum! Have not tested with other flours so please note if you change too much they will likely not be the same. . Cinnamon Roll Mug Cake . Dough>> 4 tbsp spelt flour or regular flour 1 3/4 tbsp unsweetened almond milk Pinch of salt Pinch of cinnamon 1/2 tsp brown sugar (optional) 1/2 tsp baking powder . Filling>> 1 tsp maple syrup or vegan butter 2 tsp brown sugar Pinch of cinnamon Pinch of salt . Glaze (optional)>> If you want a traditional icing, just mix 1 tbsp powdered sugar with a splash of almond milk. Mix until the right consistency is achieved. . Dough & Filling>> In a bowl, add flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and sugar and mix well. Add in milk and mix together with a fork until a dough starts to form. Go in with your hands and kneed dough for about 1-2 minutes. If dough is dry, add a small splash of milk. If dough is too wet, add a pinch of flour until it is less sticky. Knees for 1 minute and allow dough to rest for a minute, then take dough to a lightly floured surface and with hands start flattening dough and forming a rectangle. Using either maple syrup or vegan butter, lightly spread it over the dough surface then sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon over top. With a spoon, make sure to spread cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the dough. Starting from the short end of the dough, start rolling dough tightly to form a log. Cut log into 4 even pieces. Take cinnamon roll pieces and place them in a shallow mug, allowing a little space in between for them to grow. Place mug in the microwave and set to 1 minute. Allow to cook for the first 30 second and open microwave door to allow to rest for a second. Close door again and microwave for the remaining 30 seconds. Allow to rest for a few seconds and then cook for the remaining 15 seconds if buns do not appear done cooking. Once mug cake is cooked, top with icing and enjoy immediately. If you allow the mug cake to sit for a long time, it will eventually get hard.
user_30;user_3053.jpg;Because whenever I can get my hands on some fresh greens I take advantage of them with pleasure. 🙃 Was really happy to have some kale and cauliflower. Luckily, they are a little tougher, so I can count on them staying fresh for a while...not that I ever have a problem eating my way through all the veg before it goes bad anyway. 😂 . This bowl of rice topped with some sautéed garlicky chickpeas and kale was a winner. Threw in some roasted cauliflower and now this plate sits happily in my belly. 😋 . Garlicky Chickpeas and Kale 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1/2 small onion, diced 1 inch ginger, minced 3 cloves fresh garlic, minced 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp garlic chili sauce 1/4 cup water 1/2 tbsp soy sauce Pinch of salt 1 bunch kale, leaves removed from stems and roughly chopped . In a pan sauté onion with a pinch of salt. Allow to soften then add in ginger and minced garlic. Allow to sauté for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add in chickpeas, garlic chili sauce, water, soy sauce and garlic powder and stir to combine. Add in kale and stir again. Lower heat to low and place a lid on top. Cover and allow to steam for 2-4 minutes. Remove lid when leaves have wilted and stir to combine once more allowing any remaining water to cook off. Stir in any extras. To this I added some roasted cauliflower and some minced green onion. 🙌 . Serve with rice and a tahini dressing on top. Just add 1 tbsp tahini, juice of half a lemon, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, pinch of salt and 1-2 tbsp water. Whisk until smooth and pour over top. 🍚
user_30;user_3054.jpg;Needed a little bit of a breather today, so instead of making my oats from scratch. 🥣 I decided to use one of the yummy overnight oats that I was gifted from @mush. This was their blueberry one, which is my favorite. 💯 I just mashed a banana and added 1 tbsp of hemp hearts into it for more sweetness and some omegas, and just had some fun designing and topping my bowl with fruit I got from a produce box I buy weekly. Was able to top with extra banana slices, blueberries, mango and hemp hearts. 😌 . If you need a moment, just take it. You’ll be glad you did. Besides, it’s Friday, I think a lot of us need a mental break. It’s okay to not be 100% everyday. ❤️
user_30;user_3055.jpg;April’s done already? That went fast. 🙃Kind of shocked tomorrow is May. Going to enjoy the rest of today in peace with this Curry Peanut Noodle bowl. 😋 I love peanut sauce and it’s been a while since I’ve made it. Had some extra Thai green curry paste and decided to add this to the sauce base and it is really yummy. Totally okay to leave out, but definitely adds a yummy flavor twist to this sauce. 🙂 . Curry Peanut Sauce 1/4 cup peanut butter 3 tbsp gluten free soy sauce 2 tsp garlic chili sauce 1 tbsp maple syrup or brown sugar 1 tsp Thai curry paste (I used a green curry paste—still tasty without this but love the addition in this sauce) 1/2 tsp ground ginger 1/2 tsp pepper flakes 1/4 cup water . In a bowl whisk all ingredients together until smooth. If sauce is too thick, add a splash of water and whisk until consistency is a little thinner to your liking. . Noodle Prep: Stir fry veggies of choice until tender. Add cooked noodles plus 1/4 cup of the peanut sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat. Serve immediately and top with sesame seeds, baked tofu and green onion. 🙌🏽
user_30;user_3056.jpg;This rice came out so good. 💯 Inspired by my mom’s arroz con gandules. Not exactly the same because it always tastes best with white rice, but still results in some bomb tasting rice. 🙌🏽 Down the road I want to revisit this and make with white rice. 🍚Currently out, but this brown rice has come out better this batch than any other time I’ve attempted something similar. 🙂 . 1 1/2 cups brown jasmine rice (I used @lotusfoods) 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth 1/2 small onion, finely diced 1 tbsp of tomato paste 1 celery stock, minced 1/2 green bell pepper, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp oregano 1/4 tsp black pepper 2 tsp sazon 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning 1 can gandules or lentils, drained 1 handful of cilantro (optional if you don’t like the taste of it) . Start by sautéing onions, celery and green bell pepper together in a medium pot until softened. Add in garlic and spices and continue to sauté until fragrant. Next, add tomato paste along with the gandules and stir to evenly distribute. As you sauté, the tomato paste will start to turn a deeper red. Add in veggie broth, stir and bring to a boil. Once at a boil, add in rice. Allow to boil for 10 minutes then lower to a simmer and cover with a lid for an additional 10 minutes. If using a glass lid, check to see if most of liquid looks like it is gone at this point. Uncover lid and stir to avoid clumping on the bottom. Add cilantro and cover with lid again, lower to the lowest heat setting and allow to cook for 25 minutes covered (DO NOT REMOVE LID UNTIL COOKING TIME IS DONE). Remove lid and stir to fluff the rice. Adjust salt to taste and serve as desired. Paired this with broccoli, seitan and some avocado. 🥑
user_30;user_3057.jpg;Grateful to all the root veggies and chickpeas I had waiting for me in the fridge! 🙌🏽 Had some roasted beets on hand and for some reason was really craving it. Paired nicely with some carrots and mushrooms. Topped with tahini dressing (just a spoonful of tahini with juice of half a lemon, salt and garlic powder to taste). . Smoky Sweet Sautéed Chickpeas 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 small red onion, diced 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp thyme 2 tsp tamari or regular soy sauce 2 tsp liquid sweetener like maple syrup Salt & Pepper to taste Veggies of choice: I used one small diced roasted beet and a small diced carrot 🙌🏽 . Add mushrooms and onions to a sauté pan and allow to cook and brown to soften, about 3 minutes. Add in chickpeas, carrots and beets and seasonings. Sauté, allowing carrots to cook for at least 3 minutes. Add tamari and maple syrup. Sauté together allowing flavor to infuse into the chickpeas and veggies. Once liquid has cooked off, about 3-4 minutes and veggies look evenly coated and caramelized, remove from heat. Serve immediately with rice and some dressing! 💯
user_30;user_3058.jpg;Happy Monday! 🌞Just starting my week out with some much needed oatmeal. I soaked a tea bag (chai flavored), into my oats as they were cooking this morning. Smells and tastes so good. 🥣 .

user_30;user_3059.jpg;If you need a customizable lunch prep idea for the week ahead, start off by roasting a few sweet potatoes 🍠 until they are fully cooked and gooey soft, about 45-55 minutes in the oven for small to medium potatoes at 400F (make sure to poke some holes in them before baking). 🥑 Once they are baked they become the perfect vehicle for all the toppings. Sweet or savory, they can go in either direction. This is one variation I absolutely love. Just top with these buffalo black beans and add some guac and sliced tomatoes. Be creative and make them your own. 😋 . Buffalo Black Beans (serves 2-3) 1 can of black beans (if you want them saucy, do not drain can) 2 tbsp buffalo sauce (I used Frank’s Red Hot) 1 tsp garlic chili sauce 2 tsp maple syrup . In a pan add all ingredients and bring to a low simmer. Stir continuously until sauce starts to thicken to desired consistency. About 5-10 minutes after simmering. Remove from heat and serve. 🍛
user_30;user_3060.jpg;Growing up, Pollo Guisado was a Dominican dish I had quite often. 🙆🏽‍♀️For those that don’t know, that is the equivalent of stewed chicken. Obviously, I don’t eat chicken anymore. 🙅🏽‍♀️ And in a desire to recreate the flavors I remember loving, I opted for using tempeh in place of chicken. You can also use vegan “chicken” if you aren’t a fan of tempeh. 🍚 Delicious deep flavors and it becomes more flavorful the longer it sits. 💯 . Tempeh Guisado 1 block of tempeh (if not a fan of tempeh, feel free to use some mock meats as a replacement), cut into strips 1/2 onion, finely diced 1/2 green bell pepper, finely diced 1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced 1 stalk of celery, finely diced 5 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp brown sugar or maple syrup (optional) Juice of one lime 1 tbsp tomato paste 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth 1 1/2 tsp sazón (I used @eatloisa) 1/2 tsp adobo (I used @eatloisa) 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp oregano 2 tsp olive oil 1 tsp vinegar 3-4 sprigs cilantro, roughly chopped . Optional, but recommended, steam tempeh for 10 minutes to cut bitterness. Remove and allow to cool. Place tempeh in a bowl and add sugar, adobo, sazón, pepper and oregano and top with veggies. Add lime juice and soy sauce. Gently toss together and allow to sit and marinade for 30-45 mins. Heat up a pan to medium heat and add oil. Scoop tempeh out of marinade and add to pan. Carefully sauté and brown both sides. While tempeh is cooking, add tomato paste to remaining marinade and stir together. Add the marinade to the pan with the tempeh and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add vegetable broth and bring mixture to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Allow to cook and simmer on low for 30 minutes. Of pan gets dry add a little water. Once tempeh is cooked, add vinegar and turn off heat. Stir to combine and serve as desired. You can serve this with rice and avocado. So delicious. 😋
user_30;user_3061.jpg;It’s been a while since I had a good ramen bowl. This one was definitely top tier. 💯The broth is easy to make and it paired with these @lotusfoods rice noodles, cauliflower, edamame and corn perfectly. 🥰 . Tahini Miso Broth 1 tbsp tahini 2 cups veggie broth 1 tsp miso 1 tbsp soy sauce 1/2 tsp garlic chili sauce . In a bowl, add tahini and miso and mix well.

Combine ingredients (except banana) in a bowl or Tupperware. Stir and set in fridge. Add mashed banana prior to serving and serve topped with fruit. 🙂
user_30;user_3063.jpg;Happy Earth Day. 🌍Whatever small steps you can take towards success, focus on that. I know it’s easy to feel you need to do it all or it’s not worth the effort, but every little thing is vital. 🌱 . Enjoyed a plate of green tea buckwheat noodles we had in the pantry and paired it with some tempeh, green peppers and greens. The tempeh was extra bomb. 🔥 . Sweet Chili Tempeh (makes 2 servings) 1 cup veggie broth or water with 1/2 a bouillon cube) 1 block tempeh, cut into pieces 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp minced garlic 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce . In a pan add all ingredients except tempeh and bring to a simmer. Cover with lid and allow to cook for about 5 minutes. Remove lid and allow liquid to absorb into the tempeh and cook off.

user_30;user_3066.jpg;I’m always down for pancakes on the weekend. 🥞Especially if they are golden and fluffy. 😛 Here’s a fun variation of my fluffy whole grain pancakes that use cornmeal. I made using some cornmeal flour. And oh goodness it was so good. Used some fresh strawberries I had gotten from our produce box.

user_30;user_3069.jpg;Was really happy to get a restock on some food this week. 🌱 I’ve been missing my typical veggies, but had some tofu and some carrots and cabbage left over so wanted a sushi bowl. 🥕Paired this with some rice, avocado and cucumber we recently stock up from thanks to @imperfectfoods. I quick pickled the cabbage in some apple cider vinegar, salt and a little sugar. 🥣 . For the tofu, just set your oven to 400F. Cube up your tofu (make sure you drain and press out some of the water) and place in a baggie or Tupperware container. I added 2 tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce and just tossed to coat. Place your tofu spread out on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. It was so good. Feel free to marinate for longer if you have the time. 🍚
user_30;user_3070.jpg;A day ago, I was down to the bare minimum pantry wise. 🍚 Had some rice, a sad looking bunch of broccoli, a bell pepper, onion and chickpeas. Had to make it work with the condiments I had on hand. 😅 Luckily, it was delicious! And wanted to share it with you in case you need a quick meal idea. Nice and hearty and feel free to swap out with things like white beans or tofu if you’re tired of chickpeas! 🙂 . Garlic Chili Chickpeas 2 cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 small onion, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp garlic chili sauce 1 15oz can of crushed tomatoes 2 tsp smoked paprika 1 bay leaf 1 jalapeno, diced or 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper 1 green bell pepper, diced 1 tbsp soy sauce or coconut aminos 1 cup veggie broth 1 tbsp chickpea flour or regular flour 2 tsp sugar . In a cup, whisk together flour and veggie broth then set aside. In a large sauce pan, add onion and sauté until translucent. Add in peppers and garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add in tomatoes, paprika and soy sauce and stir together. Allow to cook for 1-2 minutes. Add in broth mixture and remaining ingredients into the pan and stir to combine. Allow to simmer on a low heat for at least 20 minutes. Remove bay leaf, stir well then serve. . Overtop just made a quick tahini dressing with lemon juice, tahini, garlic powder and water.
user_30;user_3071.jpg;Happy #toasttuesday! 🍞My morning is looking like fresh bread smeared with hummus and topped with some sautéed mushrooms. . Mushrooms: sauté some sliced mushrooms with a tbsp of some vegan pesto . Toast: Take a slice of your favorite bread and smear with 2 tbsp hummus, then place bread in toaster oven to heat the bread and hummus. (I had a plate of warm hummus and mushrooms a long time ago at a middle eastern restaurant and that’s the way I always want my hummus now lol). . Assemble: Top your toast with mushrooms. Feel free to add extras. I went with everything but the bagel seasoning and some cilantro. Hot sauce or a balsamic glaze works too! 😋
user_30;user_3072.jpg;It’s hard to keep up with everything at the moment. 😅 But when I have my wits about me, I generally succeed. I’ll count this falafel bowl a success. One of our produce boxes came with lots of extra cilantro and parsley. So couldn’t pass up the chance to make these. 🧆 . Falafel 1 can of Chickpeas, rinse and drained (pat dry with a towel) 2 tsp cumin 3 tbsp rolled/quick oats 1/4 medium onion, diced 1 handful of cilantro, tough stems removed 1 handful fresh parsley, tough stems removed 2 tsp minced garlic 1/4 tsp salt 🥙 Optional but totally worth adding: 1 tsp smoked paprika and 1 jalapeño (you can make these with an extra spanish flare and add 1 tsp sazón) . Take all ingredients and add to a food processor (I used my cheap tiny food processor which is much easier to clean). Process the ingredients together until mixture is slightly crumbly, but sticks together very well (if you can’t form a ball without it falling a part then you should process it a little more. Take a small spoon full of the mixture and roll between your hands to make even looking falafel balls (should make 12). You can cook the falafel in a preheated oven set at 400F for 25 minutes on one side then flip (please do it with a spatula to prevent the falafel from getting stuck and ripping) and bake for another 5 minutes or until golden. If using your airfrier, set temperature to 370 and allow falafel to cook for 9 minutes. Serve as desired. 🥒 Feel free to double recipe for more falafel. 💚
user_30;user_3073.jpg;Before all the craziness, Greg’s boss was super kind and gave us some dry black beans to cook with (we were told these were a special Brazilian variety). Definitely subtle differences from the normal variety we are used to, so I was happy to experiment with them in a new recipe. It’s also been a while since I made fresh black beans from dry beans, and it’s definitely worth the time. Mind you, you can make this recipe using normal dry black beans. Should still come out super yummy, and still perfect to pair with some rice. 🍚 Notes for this recipe: you can cook this in the instant pot or on the stovetop. Instant pot is less involved, which I always prefer. But instructions for both methods are available below. 🥣 . Garlic Herb Black Bean Stew . For the black beans 2 cups or 1 lb dry black beans 2 bay leaves 1 medium onion diced 1 tbsp smoked paprika Salt to taste . Garlic Herb Mince 1 cup packed fresh parsley with stems 4 large cloves garlic, minced or 2 tbsp jarred minced garlic 1 tsp miso paste (optional, but gives a nice umami flavor) 2 tbsp tahini or olive oil Zest and juice of one lime 2 tbsp nutritional yeast 1/2 cup water 1/2 tsp salt . Rinse and pick over dry beans. Soak beans in water overnight (you can use a quick boil method to help skip overnight soaking). Drain and rinse beans, add to a large pot and cover with 4 inches of fresh water. Add bay leaves and bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and lightly simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until tender. . While beans are cooking, add all of garlic herb mince ingredients to a food processor and process on high 30 seconds. Scrape down sides and process for another 30 seconds until mixture looks well blended and there are no large chunks. Set aside. . Once beans are tender, sauté onions in a separate pan until translucent then add 1/3 cup of the herb mixture and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer this mixture to the beans along with the smoked paprika and stir to combine. Bring to a gentle boil and allow to cook for 15-20 minutes or until beans have thickened. Adjust salt to taste and serve. 🌱 . [INSTANT POT DIRECTIONS IN COMMENTS]>>>
user_30;user_3074.jpg;Quarantine has me baking up a storm. 🌱Retested some muffins, made a loaf of bread and now some amazing vegan cookie mug cakes. I have the recipe here, but you can also find it on my blog. 🍪 . If you are asking yourself why you would want to make one, then let me set the mood. No big mess. Basic pantry ingredients. Cooks in the microwave in just 1 minute and 30 seconds. Tastes amazing, warm, gooey...did I sell you on it yet? 😂 . Vegan Cookie Mug Cake 4 tbsp flour of choice (I used spelt flour) 1/2 tsp baking powder 1 tbsp brown sugar Pinch of salt 2 tbsp natural peanut butter (other nut and seed butters work) 1/4 cup dairy free milk 1-2 tbsp chocolate chips . Add dry ingredients except chocolate chips in a mug. Add peanut butter and milk and whisk together with a fork. Fold in chocolate chips and place mug in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Please note, every microwave is different. If you are worried yours might be set too high, microwave for 45-50 seconds first. Open the door, check doneness of cake and microwave for an additional 10 seconds until cake looks baked. Make sure to have enough space in your mug to allow your cake to rise. You can make this allergy friendly with a few swaps. . Use dairy free chocolate chips. Use the dairy free milk you prefer. Use oat flour, almond flour or 1 to 1 gluten free all purpose flour. Use a seed butter instead of nut butter to make nut free. 🍪 . Don’t burn your mouth! Wait for it to cool a little before taking a bite. ✨
user_30;user_3075.jpg;Good morning everyone. Or maybe afternoon.

user_30;user_3076.jpg;It’s been forever and a day since I’ve had Thai curry. I’ve been thinking about it more now that we can’t go out to restaurants. But I improvised and made an inspired variety. Was so good! And to change it up I poured the amazing sweet curry sauce over some @lotusfoods rice noodles and 🤤🤤 .

Mix well to combine and allow to finish cooking. Top with baked tofu and serve overtop rice or rice noodles. Recipe serves 4. . For tofu, you can follow my tofu recipe that you can find on my blog, use preflavored tofu and bake or you can also just add a can of chickpeas to this when adding your veggies in. . For the curry paste, I use the Thai Kitchen brand. You can find in the international section of your store.
user_30;user_3077.jpg;Cozying up to some oats this morning (but cozy up to a bowl of oats anytime of day). 🥣Topped with warm apple and chocolate chips.

user_30;user_3079.jpg;Happy Monday! ✨ Was missing oatmeal and needed a bowl to get me through the morning. Things that have been making my oats more exciting recently: . 🌱Cook oats with plant milk (I’ve been loving soy milk) 🌱Cook fruit/veggies into your oats (try banana, grated apples, grated zucchini, dried fruit, or frozen berries) 🌱 Soak a really flavorful tea into your oats (I like cookie flavored teas a lot) 🌱 Try different spices. Currently loving pumpkin spice and ginger notes. . Spiced Coconut Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flax seed 1 tbsp coconut flakes 1 cup unsweetened almond/coconut milk 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice 1/2 tsp ginger Splash of vanilla extract Pinch of salt . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes then remove from stove top. Top oats as desired and enjoy! 💜
user_30;user_3080.jpg;It’s so interesting to go through my feed now. 🌱 Everyone has prepared so differently for staying at home. Different food priorities and if anything it’s pushing me to be very conscious of the things I share. 😬 . Salads right now are tough. I actually made this before quarantine. But! You can modify. If you don’t have greens, totally cool! Replace with rice, quinoa or extra roasted (squash, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, etc.). Instead of mixing the dressing in the greens, reserve and pour over salad if not using greens. Let me know if you need help making something similar. 🙃 . BBQ Chickpeas 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 tbsp tahini 2 tbsp favorite BBQ sauce Pinch of salt . Place all ingredients in a bowl and toss together to coat chickpeas evenly. Bake on line baking sheet and place in the oven for 25 minutes. If you are using an airfrier, place chickpeas in airfrier and bake at 370F for 15 minutes or until crunchy. Remove chickpeas from oven and allow to completely cool. . Adobo Tahini Dressing 3 tbsp tahini Juice of one lemon 1 tsp miso paste 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp maple syrup 1 tsp mustard 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp adobo seasoning 4 tbsp water Salt and pepper to taste . Smoky Adobo Chickpea Salad 1 romaine heart, chopped or 1 bagged salad BBQ Chickpeas 1 cup frozen fire roasted corn 1 avocado, chopped 1 cup roasted frozen broccoli 1/4 cup adobo tahini dressing . In a small bowl add in all dressing ingredients and whisk until smooth. Add more water 1 tbsp at a time if you want to make the consistency a little thinner to your liking. In a large bowl add greens and top with 1/2 the dressing. Toss to coat all romaine leaves. Toss in remaining ingredients plus remaining dressing and toss to coat again. Serve as desired. 🌱
user_30;user_3081.jpg;Apples have become my favorite snack recently. 🥣 Mostly because they don’t spoil as easily. We had too many apples at one point this week so I diced them up and made a crumble. ✨ Considering I love apple and peanut butter, I made the crumble on top include pb to pay homage. Bake for a little longer and you get the gooey-ness of typical apple crumble. I chose to enjoy it more as a granola and serve with some @culinayogurt. So good. 🍎 . Baked Apple Crumble Granola/Regular Apple Crumble . For the Apples 4 apples, diced into small pieces 3 tbsp maple syrup Juice of one lemon 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice 1/2 tsp ginger powder . For the Oats 1 1/2 cups oats 3 tbsp peanut butter (or other nut and seed butter) 1 tbsp almond flour or all purpose flour 3 tbsp maple syrup Salt to taste . Set oven to 350F. In a bowl combine apples, lemon juice, pinch of salt and pumpkin pie spice. Toss together with clean hands and place it at the bottom of a baking dish. In a separate bowl, combine all oat crumble ingredients and stir to combine using a fork. It’s okay to see it clump, just make sure peanut butter is spread out as much between the oats as you can. With hands, evenly spread oat mixture over apples. Take baking tray and place in the oven. . For granola consistency, bake for 25-30 minutes. Apples should still be tender. . For actual apple crumble, add a tsp of corn starch to your apple mixture and allow to cook for longer, about 45-50 mins to allow apples to release moisture and fully soften. 🍎

user_30;user_3084.jpg;Good morning, everybody! 🌻 I've managed to survive my morning commute to the kitchen to make a cup of hot tea and am safely back in my chair. It was a little touch-and-go rounding the corner of the dining table, but I made it! I am always traveling, so I ended up commuting back to the kitchen to make these pancakes. But don’t worry, I put on an apron to protect my work attire. You know...safety first! 🥞 . 😄 Hopefully that cheered someone up!

user_30;user_3090.jpg;So I was totally inspired by @veggiekins with this oatmeal after seeing her way of adding turmeric to cocoa powder in beverages. 💕 This oatmeal is chocolatey but has the extra kick of antioxidant nutrition from the added turmeric without making your oats look unappetizing. 🤣 Also major win for chocolate. And I know there is probably a big need for chocolate right now (primarily from me). 😂🍫 . Chocolate Spiced Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp ground flax seed 1 tbsp cocoa powder 1/2 tsp cinnamon Pinch of ground ginger Pinch of turmeric 1 ripe banana, sliced or mashed Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened almond milk 2 tsp sweetener of choice (optional but I recommend) . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir to combine well and allow to cook and thicken for at least 5 minutes. Remove from stove top and allow to sit as your prep your toppings. Stir once more before serving then top as desired. 🤎
user_30;user_3091.jpg;Spent this weekend reshooting one of my favorite recipes, bbq seitan from scratch. 👏🏽I actually realized that I didn’t have bbq sauce and didn’t want to risk going to the store again, so made my own along with the seitan. 🔥 I’ll be sharing the makeshift BBQ sauce recipe below just in case. 🥫Paired the leftover seitan with some yakisoba noodles, and sautéed peppers and brussel sprouts. 🍜 . BBQ Baked Seitan 1 cup vital wheat gluten (I used @bobsredmill) 2 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp onion powder 1 cup veggie broth 1 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp tahini or nut/seed butter of choice (peanut butter works well here too) 1/3 cup BBQ sauce of choice ✨ . Combine all dry ingredients. Add in the wet ingredients except BBQ sauce and give a gentle stir to combine. A dough should begin to form. With your hands gently knees into a dough ball (do not over kneed...this step should just take less than a minute to do). Transfer dough to a lined baking sheet. Flatten and spread dough out until it is inch thick. Then place in a preheated oven at 350F for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and brush both sides with your favorite BBQ sauce. At this stage you can either grill or rebake your seitan. For equipment purposes I went with baking this again for another 10 mins. At the very end of baking to help char ends a little I broiled it on high for 2 minutes. Once removed from the oven. Allow to cook slightly before cutting it into strips as desired. 🌱 . BBQ Sauce 1/2 cup tomato paste 2 tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp blackstrap molasses 1/2 tsp salt 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 3/4 cup vegetable broth 2 tsp smoked paprika (if you have some liquid smoke definitely add a splash for extra smoky flavor) 2 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder . Add ingredients except salt and apple cider vinegar to a sauce pan and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for 10 minutes. Allow sauce to cool completely then add in salt and apple cider vinegar and stir well. Pour into a container and store in the fridge. 🌻
user_30;user_3092.jpg;Spent some time doing some small things that I enjoy. 🦋I spent a little extra time in bed. Got up and baked some more banana bread. Had a warm cup of tea, uninterrupted. And now getting a few simple tasks like cleaning and recipe testing done. Not sure what the week ahead has in store for me, but just going to focus on taking things one thing at a time. 🍞 . Chocolate Chip Walnut Banana Bread 🍫 2 tbsp ground flaxseed 4 tbsp water 3 ripe bananas 1/4 cup natural peanut butter 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 tsp ground cardamom or cinnamon 1 tsp baking soda 2 tsp baking powder 2 cups spelt flour** 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 cup walnuts** 1/3 cup chocolate chips . Preheat oven to 350F. In a medium sized mixing bowl combine ground flaxseed and water, stir and let sit for 5 minutes. Once flax seeds gel up, add ripe bananas and with a fork or whisk, mash bananas really well until mostly smooth. Add in peanut butter, apple cider vinegar, cardamom/cinnamon, vanilla and brown sugar and mix well into the banana and flax egg mixture. Add in baking soda and baking powder and whisk together to evenly combine. Add in flour 1/2 cup at a time and mix into batter. Repeat until all of the flour is incorporated. Add walnuts and chocolate chips then fold them into the batter.Batter will be thick, spoon batter into a lightly greased loaf pan and place in the oven. Bake in the over for 50-55 minutes, making sure a toothpick comes out clean. . **I swapped walnuts today for hazelnut. Almost makes it feel like I’m eating a Nutella banana bread with the chocolate chips added. **If you want to swap out flours you can use all purpose flour, 1to1 gluten free flour mix, 1 cup oat flour with 1 cup cup rice flour, or whole wheat pastry flour. If you’ve tried this recipe with other flour combinations, would love to know how they turned out! Thank you! 💜
user_30;user_3093.jpg;I’m gonna tell you a secret. 🤐I’m not the biggest pasta fan. It’s not that I don’t like it. More so that it’s not my first choice (that is reserved for rice). But, on those rare occasions I do have pasta, this is a version I definitely don’t mind eating. ❤️ This bowl of smoky lentil pasta is easy and involves minimal as well as customizable ingredients. I’ll mention some of the variations I’ve tried that still came out super amazing and delicious. 🥣 . Smoky Lentil Pasta 2 servings of dry pasta (I used rigatoni) 1/2 cup dry lentils 2 cups veggie broth 2 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp dry basil 1 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tbsp tahini OR 1/4 cup full fat coconut milk Or 1/4 cup hummus 1/2 cup pasta water 1/2 6oz can of tomato paste (2.5 tbsp) Handful of greens of choice (I used collards) . In a sauce pan add lentils and veggie broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes on low heat with a lid. In a separate pot cook pasta according to package. For the lentils, remove lid and add tomato paste and all seasonings. Stir to combine and add tahini (or substitution of choice) and greens. Stir once more and simmer for 5 minutes. Once pasta is cooked, reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and drain the pasta. Add pasta and pasta water to the pan with the lentils. Stir to evenly coat pasta with the sauce. Serve with addition toppings of choice. 🥫
user_30;user_3094.jpg;I notice I’ve been going for more cooked fruit in my oats recently. 🍐 It’s just so good. I can’t help it. 🙈 Today it was some cooked pears with berries and chocolate chips. So good! And for the rest of the day, going to be making some yummy food that I plan to share with you guys and maybe some fun surprises for you all too! ❤️ . Banana Peanut Butter Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp ground flaxseed 1 sliced banana or replace with 2 tsp sweetener 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon 1 cup unsweetened almond milk 1 tbsp peanut butter Salt to taste . Add all ingredients to sauce pan, stir to combine and allow to cook and thicken for 5 minutes. I sautéed some diced pears until they were softened in cinnamon, 2 tsp maple syrup and a pinch of salt then added on top of the oats. 😛 . For the pears, just chop one pear into cubes. Place in a pan with 2 tsp maple syrup, pinch of salt and pinch of cinnamon. Stir and sauté on low heat until maple syrup coats pears and pears slightly soften and brown. 🥣
user_30;user_3095.jpg;Random meal thrown together with things I had left for the week. 🍠 I was also in need of a Japanese sweet potato, so was happy to pop this in the oven. Paired it with some hummus that I added some smoked paprika and adobo seasoning to and thinned out with a little water for an easy dressing. Then paired it with some greens, edamame, broccoli and some blood oranges. Funky salad, but it all tasted great to me. 🤪 . I will say, with more free time for myself, you’d think I’d try to be productive, but have definitely not been. It’s totally okay if you haven’t either. I just want to sleep, laugh at Jenna Marbles videos and watch K-dramas to my hearts content. I think I’ll do exactly that this weekend until I feel refreshed again. 🙃
user_30;user_3096.jpg;This week feels like it’s been a whole year. 💀How are you? Are you guys okay? I’ve been so worried about everyone. So stressed that I forgot to eat and it’s like almost 3pm and I’m now just having oatmeal. I needed something comforting so I made my typical oats and topped them with some caramelized banana, chocolate chips, peanut butter, @soomfoods date syrup and pepitas and cacao nibs. I need this like no other. 👏🏽 . For the bananas I just sliced some up and put them in a non stick pan with some maple syrup, salt and pumpkin pie spice and cooked them until they were soft on low medium heat. Imagine my happiness taking a bite of this. My smile was ear to ear. 😁
user_30;user_3097.jpg;I got a bunch of root veggies in my box this week because they tend to last a lot longer than some of the other tender veggies. 🥦🥬 I roasted a beet and I know beets get a lot of hate, but they came out so yummy and sweet. ❤️ Paired this with white rice, romaine lettuce, carrot ribbons, avocado, bbq tempeh and cilantro. Sprinkled with everything but the bagel seasoning. Random, but totally yummy. 😌 . The bbq tempeh was super simple. To make, take one block of tempeh and slice into thin strips. In a container add 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp water and 2 tsp maple syrup the. Stir to combine. Add tempeh strips to container and let sit for 30 minutes. Remove from container and place on a lined baking sheet. Baste tempeh with your favorite bbq sauce. Flip tempeh and baste the other side with sauce. Place in a preheated oven at 400F and bake for about 15 minutes.add extra sauce at the end or enjoy as is. 🥰
user_30;user_3098.jpg;🍌🍞 Everyone must be on the same wavelength because everyone is posting banana bread recipes right now. I had ripe bananas this weekend so I made this amazing chocolate chip walnut banana bread and at this point it’s all gone. 🤣 Enjoyed one of the last slices on top of my oats and such a good decision. 🤤 If you want to bookmark this recipe, I’ve also linked it to my profile for easy access. ❤️ .

user_30;user_3099.jpg;Because plantains are my forever staple and just my favorite food next to mango. 😙 If you’ve never used plantains but happen to see them hanging out in the store or you picked some up on a whim, check out 2 quick tutorials for them in my highlights (one for green unripe plantains and the yellow/black ripe variety). I roasted some, made some black beans and roasted corn mix and some sautéed broccoli and drizzled with tahini sauce (just tahini, lemon juice and water—super basic). 🥦 . Black Bean with Fire Roasted Corn 🌽 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup veggie broth 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp sazon 1 tbsp tomato paste 1/2 cup frozen fire roasted corn or feel free to use canned corn (drain before using) 1/2 small onion, diced . Sauté onion on low medium heat and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and sazón and sauté until fragrant. Add tomato paste, veggie broth and garlic powder and stir to combine. Simmer for 10-15 minutes on low heat. Won’t the back of your cooking spoon, lightly mash beans to thicken them. Add in frozen corn, turn off heat and stir to combine. Allow to sit for 2 minutes then serve. Love this with fresh lime juice, but don’t worry if you do t have on hand. 👏🏽
user_30;user_30100.jpg;Needed a serious pick me up today. 😶I wanted matcha oats and that’s what I had. Thank you matcha for having my back during very uncertain times. 🍵💚 .

Allow to cook and thicken while stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes. Remove oats from heat and add in matcha mixture to oats and fold into oats until matcha is fully incorporated. Adjust salt to taste. 🍵
user_30;user_30101.jpg;I needed this bowl so much. 🍛 My favorite pantry meal. I feel like I always have all the ingredients on hand no matter what. Literally have enough of these staples to make this 5 times if needed. 😂 Peanut stew is so good, but I feel that I love the addition of chickpeas and lentils in this to help boost the protein while still enjoying the rich flavor. Filling and super balances. Feel free to leave the greens out or swap for spinach. 🥬 . Chickpea Peanut Stew 1 can chickpea, rinsed and drained 1/2 onion, diced 1 6 oz can tomato paste 1 tbsp minced garlic 1 inch fresh minced ginger or 1 tsp ginger powder 2 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp cumin 2 cups cubed sweet potato 1/3 cup chunky peanut butter 1/4 cup red lentils 1/4 tsp salt or to taste 3 cups vegetable broth 5 collard leaves, cut into strips . For Instant Pot, add all ingredients except collards to cooking pot. Stir to evenly distribute and seal pressure cooker completely. Set pressure cooker to manual for 10 minutes and allow to pressure to naturally release. Unseal pressure cooker and stir in collard green strips to naturally wilt from the heat of the stew for about 5 minutes. . If cooking on stove top, add onions to a large pot and saute for 3 minutes on medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, cumin and smoked paprika, allowing seasonings to become fragrant (about 2 minutes). Add in chickpeas, lentils and tomato paste and fold into onions and seasonings. Add in vegetable broth and peanut butter, give mixture a good stir to evenly mix. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat back down to a simmer and cover with lid, allowing stew to cook for about 20-30 minutes or until sweet potatoes are cooked all the way through. Turn off heat and add in collard green strips, stirring to incorporate into stew. Season stew to taste and serve with scallions, cilantro and avocado to your liking.
user_30;user_30102.jpg;Maca oats for a crazy busy day. 😬Lots of nut butter and sautéed pears as well. Omg so good. I always forget about pears but super sweet and satisfying! 👏🏽 . Maca Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp ground flaxseed 1 mashed banana or replace with 2 tsp sweetener 1 tsp maca powder 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon 1 cup unsweetened almond milk Salt to taste . Add all ingredients to sauce pan, stir to combine and allow to cook and thicken for 5 minutes. I sautéed some diced pears until they were softened in cinnamon, 2 tsp maple syrup and a pinch of salt then added on top of the oats. 😛
user_30;user_30103.jpg;1 or 2? 📸 Couldn’t decide. The first one is actually what my plate looked like a minute after I mixed and took a bite. 😛There was something when I looked at the bowl that reminded me of a memory of a food experience I had and it made me capture the deliciousness one more time. 🤣 . Minced Tofu 1 block of firm tofu, drained and pressed for at least 30 minutes 2 tbsp soy sauce 3 cloves garlic minced 1/2 inch knob of ginger, minced 1 small yellow onion, minced 2 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp dry basil 1 tsp fennel seed 1/2 tsp of Trader Joe’s chicken-less seasoning salt or poultry seasoning 1 tsp cumin Pinch of cinnamon 2 tsp sriracha . In a pan sauté onion until softened. Add in 2 tbsp of water along with garlic and ginger. Sauté until fragrant, 2 minutes. Crumble in tofu and add soy sauce, sriracha and remaining seasonings. Sauté tofu, breaking it into smaller crumbles in a pan and sautéing to coat evenly with seasoning. Sauté and cook to remove as much moisture from the tofu, about 10 minutes. Taste tofu and adjust salt and pepper to preference. Remove from heat and serve as desired, I went with @lotusfoods ramen. 🥬
user_30;user_30104.jpg;Plugging along. Made my oats while watching the snow we’re getting. Never a dull moment apparently. 😬 Just some extra zoats from my previous batch. Once a couple of fires are put out this morning, I will post my banana bread (literally, didn’t even think of posting it because there’s so many out there, but I’ll still throw my hat in the ring today with my own). For the moment, stay well, stay hydrated, stretch your body or stand every so often when you can. ❤️ . Toppings for this bowl include kiwi, blackberries, pepitas and cacao nibs. 🥰
user_30;user_30105.jpg;Very productive day. 🙂Spent most of the day cleaning, recipe testing and literally lost track of the time. 🤷🏽‍♀️ So posting some food I enjoyed in between, which included this bowl of brown rice, steamed bok choy, steamed broccoli, and steamed kabocha squash and some baked tempeh with peanut sauce. 🍚 . Tempeh: Cut block of tempeh into cubes. Place in a Tupperware with 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tsp maple syrup, and 1 tsp garlic chili sauce. Place on baking sheet and bake at 400F for 15 minutes. . Peanut Sauce: 1 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tsp garlic chili sauce, 2 tsp low sodium soy sauce, juice of half a lime, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp ginger powder and 1 tbsp water. Whisk together and drizzle over food. 🥜 . Nothing fancy. Just getting through the rest of the bok choy and tempeh sounded really good with it. 😙
user_30;user_30106.jpg;Its Sunday brunch time. 🥞And the simple things are making me smile this morning. Like the fact that as I took a mini walk for fresh air, I saw some trees with tiny buds on the branches. In the very least it’s sunny and I have pancakes. Trying not to blow through my reserve of syrup so relying on some of the last bits of fresh fruit and toasted coconut flakes I lucked out on last week to enjoy these pancakes with. 🥭 . Coconut Cardamom Pancakes 1 mashed ripe banana 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 flax egg (1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water mixed together, allow to set for 5 mins) 1 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp cardamom 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/4 tsp salt 1 1/4 cup canned lite coconut milk 3 tbsp coconut flakes 1 tbsp white vinegar 1 cup white whole wheat flour 🥞 . In a medium mixing bowl, add all ingredients except flour and whisk together to evenly mix. Add in flour, and whisk into the wet ingredients, but avoid over mixing. On a preheated griddle or pan (I use a non-stick surface so don’t use oil, but feel free to grease your surface if your cookware tends to stick), ladle 1/4 cup of batter onto cooking surface and spread out as desired. Allow to cook for about 3-4 minutes or once underside is golden (batter should bubble and the edges will appear to be drying), then flip and cook other side for about 2-3 minutes or until fully cooked. Continue this process until all pancakes are cooked. Makes 8 pancakes. 🥞
user_30;user_30107.jpg;Had a lot of random food items that needed to be used up, so in the same bowl they all went. 🤗 That is generally how most of my meals come about. Usually I need to use something up and I observe my surroundings and pull a bunch of ingredients together. Today, that involved baking a bunch of items in the oven and putting them over some greens and carrot ribbons. Here’s a sheet pan concept that might be helpful if you’re trying to use up some ingredients at home. 🥦 . Chickpea Plantain Sheet Pan (makes 2 servings) 1 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into coins (or use sweet potato) 1/2 cup frozen broccoli 1/2 cup chickpeas (cooked/canned—rinse and drain) 1/2 package tempeh, cut into cubes 1 small onion roughly chopped 1 tbsp gochujang or Sriracha 2 tsp soy sauce 2 tsp sugar or maple syrup 2 tbsp water 1 tbsp oil or tahini (I used tahini cause I’m addicted, but just in case you don’t have use oil) 1/4 tsp cornstarch 1/2 small red onion 1/2 tsp ground ginger powder 1/2 tsp garlic powder . Preheat oven to 400F. In a medium bowl, combine everything except plantains, broccoli, chickpeas and tempeh. Whisk together sauce. Add chickpeas and tempeh and toss together to coat. Place chickpeas and tempeh on one section of a lined baking sheet. In the other section add sliced plantain, and in the last section place frozen broccoli. Season broccoli with a pinch of garlic, salt and pepper. Place baking tray in oven and bake for about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and divide ingredients into two separate bowls to serve. Add greens or other veggies as desired. 🥬 . Dressing: Just 1 tbsp tahini, 1/4 tsp adobo seasoning, juice of half a lemon and 2 tbsp water whisked together.
user_30;user_30108.jpg;Anyone feeling their day start off really slow? 😪 There’s a lot to do, but my current mood this Saturday morning is “nah, I want to stare at my ceiling and just not think.” Eventually I’ll get started with things, but for now I’m going to listen to some music, eat this bowl of zoats and sautéed apples, and think of how I want my day to go. 🙃 . Zoats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1/2 small zucchini, grated (make carrot cake oats by swapping grated carrot) 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice 1 ripe banana (mashed or sliced into coins) 1 tsp maple syrup or sweetener of choice 1 cup unsweetened soy milk Pinch of salt . If you don’t like the green bits showing, peel your zucchini before grating. In a sauce pan add all your ingredients and stir to combine. Cook and stir to allow to thicken and fluff up for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and salt to taste or adjust sweetness to preference. For an extra treat sauté some diced apples in a pinch pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon, pinch of salt, 2 tbsp water and 2 tsp maple syrup or sugar. Sauté until apple soften and mixture is absorbed into the apples. Then top over oats. 🍎
user_30;user_30109.jpg;Shared a little cooking story of this chickpea tahini stew. 🍛Uses pantry staples and can be customized based on things you might have on hand. Paired this with some chickpea pasta for an extra boost of protein, but this is also something I love to eat with rice as well. There’s just something about a good tomato sauce and rice. 🍚 . Chickpea Tahini Stew 1 can chickpeas 1 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 small onion, diced 1 heaping tbsp of tahini Juice of half a lemon Zest of lemon (optional) 2 tsp dry basil 2 tsp oregano 1 tsp red pepper flakes 1 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp sugar Salt and pepper to taste 1 bunch kale, stems removed and roughly chopped Optional: 2 tbsp nutritional yeast (I didn’t have any so I went without) . In a pan, add onion and sauté with a pinch of salt until onions soften. Add garlic, and sauté until fragrant. Add tomatoes, spices and sauté for 2 minutes. Add tahini and chickpeas (and nutritional yeast of using) and stir to fully combine. Add sugar, stir and cover. Reduce to a low heat and allow to simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add in kale, stir and recover for an additional 5 minutes. Add in lemon juice and lemon zest. Add salt and pepper to taste and stir well before serving. Serve with chickpea pasta for an extra satisfying protein boost. I used @eatbanza shells and the tahini I use is always @soomfoods because of the creaminess. 🤤
user_30;user_30110.jpg;Has anyone else gone to making their own bread yet because there’s none in the stores? 🙃 If you still have bread or worried about it going bad, just remember that you can always store in the freezer. For now until my store restocks bread, time to pull out the bread machine. 👌🏽 I enjoyed this slice of spelt bread with peanut butter, banana slices, pepitas, cacao nibs and a drizzle of maple syrup. Fueling through the last of this crazy week and hoping to rest and re-energize for the next week ahead. 🍞
user_30;user_30111.jpg;Peanut noodles. 👏🏽 I’m sorry, but also not sorry for using so much peanut butter recently. 🥜 It’s like one of the ingredients out there that just adds so much flavor, easy to have at home and just adds a fun twist to everything. 🙌🏽 As far as I’m concerned, different food items are just a vessel for peanut butter. Apple...peanut butter. Chocolate...peanut butter. Celery...peanut butter. Noodles??? Yes, peanut butter. It’s that food item I never get tired of. So if you’re not tired of it like I am, here are some peanut noodles. 🙈 . Peanut Noodles 1 package of @lotusfoods pad Thai noodles 2 tbsp peanut butter 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 2 tsp maple syrup 2 tsp garlic chili sauce 1/4 tsp garlic powder 1/4 tsp ground ginger Juice of half a lime 2-3 tbsp water 1 package worth of baked tofu* 2 cups veggies of choice: I used a mix of shredded purple cabbage, shredded carrots, greens and scallions. . Cook noodles according to package. In a small bowl combine all remaining sauce ingredients and stir to fully combine. Add more water if you want the consistency to be thinner. Set sauce aside. Drain noodles and rinse under cold water. Place noodles back into pan and pour sauce over noodles. Stir to coat noodles evenly. Add in veggies and tofu. Toss to combine and serve. 👏🏽 . Pantry Friendly Ideas: a majority of this meal is pantry friendly. We used noodles for the base. Hearty veggies add a nice texture but will keep longer in your fridge. Think carrots and cabbage. You do not need to include greens if you don’t have that available. If you keep the ends of your spring onion, you can regrow them by placing in a little water (do a google search to find how to do it properly). Peanut butter, soy sauce, garlic chili sauce are all cheap and easy to store. If you don’t have maple syrup, you can swap in equal amount of sugar. I baked some tofu for protein (tossed a block of chopped pressed tofu with 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce, 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning, pinch of salt. Toss and bake at 400F for 25 minutes). If not tofu available, consider chickpeas or edamame as a replacement. ☀️
user_30;user_30112.jpg;🍌 Had some really ripe bananas today so thought I’d make some banana bread oats. Also needed to use up some of the last of my berries! So good and yummy, also nice and comfortingly gooey. 🙂 . Banana Bread Oatmeal 1/3 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flaxseed 1 ripe banana, diced or mashed 2 tsp brown sugar 1 cup unsweetened soy milk 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice Salt to taste . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir until thickened to desired consistency. I wanted my oats to be thick, so I cooked it to about 6-7 minutes on medium heat while stirring. Just serve with extra banana and extra cinnamon on top. So good. 👌🏽
user_30;user_30113.jpg;I miss my mom. The one thing I hate about this whole situation is not being able to see her right now. 😭 Made lentils that were inspired by her today. Was really craving it, and they came out so yummy (hope she’s proud! Definitely makes me miss her more, but it’s helping for the moment. 🍛 . Hearty Lentil Stew 1 cup dry green lentils 1 small potato, diced 1 small onion, diced 1 tsp adobo seasoning or to taste 1 tsp cumin 1 tsp smoked paprika 2 tsp oregano 3 cups vegetable broth 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 bell pepper or roasted bell pepper, diced Bunch of cilantro with stems, roughly chopped . Sauté onions until softened in a large sauce pan. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add spices, potatoes, bell pepper, and lentils and stir well for at least 1 minute. Add in broth, stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover with a lid and allow lentils to cook for at least 30 minutes or when lentils are tender. Remove lid and stir in cilantro. Serve with rice. 🍚
user_30;user_30114.jpg;Quick breakfast post before I get on with the rest of my day. 🥣 Hi! 👋🏽 How are you all doing? Are you okay? With everything going on, I find myself checking on people a lot more because I know the situation isn’t ideal. Sometimes just asking and listening to see if someone is okay is such a huge deal. Regardless, sending strength to you all this week (especially our health care workers, delivery people, restaurant workers, small business owners, grocery store workers—they all need so much love and kindness right now). ❤️ I’m good at the moment. Everything feels normal outside of keeping myself inside primarily. But outside of that peachy. 🍑 Or I should say mangoy since I haven’t had much issue loading up on some fun fruits like mangos, kiwi and golden berries. 🤷🏽‍♀️ . Spiced Coconut Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flax seed 1 tbsp coconut flakes 1 cup unsweetened almond/coconut milk 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice 1/2 tsp ginger Splash of vanilla extract Pinch of salt . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes then remove from stove top. Top oats as desired and enjoy!
user_30;user_30115.jpg;Dinner was easy and didn’t involve a lot of ingredients. 🥣 Just used what I had on hand which included chickpeas, some condiments, brown rice, greens, and some cabbage I quick pickled. 🥬 . Dinner How To 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 tbsp gochujang* 2 tsp soy sauce 2 tsp sugar or maple syrup 1/2 cup water Pinch of cornstarch 1/2 small red onion 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional) 1 inch fresh ginger minced or 1/2 tsp ground ginger powder . In a pan add onion and mushrooms and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes. Add in chickpeas and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add in gochujang, soy sauce, sweetener, and water and stir to fully combine. Bring to a simmer and allow sauce to reduce for about 5-8 minutes. Add in a pinch of cornstarch and stir. Allow sauce to continue cooking and thicken for 1-2 minutes and remove from the stove to serve. 🍚 . *If you do not have gochujang available, you can sub out for Sriracha sauce or garlic chili sauce. I would balance and adjust the soy sauce and sweetener to your liking to accommodate the spice of Sriracha. 🌶
user_30;user_30116.jpg;🤔Not sure if it’s a thing, but I loaded up on kiwis bc apparently no one is buying those in the store (any cheap exotic produce is still hanging out in stores which is great). They were cheap and a tasty addition for breakfast this week. 🥝 Normally I eat the skin, but didn’t want to get into internet debate today about it (yes you can eat it and it’s very nutritious and also saves you from having to peel it). My bowl includes kiwi, raspberries, blackberries, banana, peanut butter and cacao nibs. 🤗 . Vanilla Banana Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp ground flax seeds 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 banana sliced (reserve half for topping) Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened soy milk . Add all ingredients except banana and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and stir for about 3 minutes as it begins to thicken. Add in banana and continue to cook for an additional 2 minutes then remove from heat and serve. 🥣
user_30;user_30117.jpg;Loving myself for remembering that I had leftovers of this stew. 🍛Today got a bit more busy than I originally thought it would. 😪 So instead of cooking from scratch I pulled out this yummy meal I made two weeks ago. In case you missed this, the recipe is below. I paired the chickpeas with some @lotusfoods Organic Brown Basmati Rice, avocado and sautéed bok choy (sautéed the greens on low medium heat with 2 tsp soy sauce and 2 tsp sweet chili sauce until fully coated and greens bright green and tender). 🥬 . Moroccan Inspired Chickpeas 1 can diced tomatoes 1 can chickpeas 1 cup diced kabocha squash (feel free to use sweet potato) 3 cloves garlic 1 inch fresh ginger, minced 1/4 red onion, diced 2 tsp low sodium soy sauce 1 cup veggie broth 2 tsp store bought Moroccan spice blend (or 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Garam Masala, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cumin)** Salt and pepper to taste . In a medium pan add onions and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add in kabocha squash, tomatoes, chickpeas and remaining spices. Sauté until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add in soy sauce and veggie broth. Bring to a boil and allow to cook for about 20-25 minutes or until a good majority of the liquid is absorbed. 🌱 . Please note that the spices here do not reflect true authentic Moroccan cuisine, hence why I used inspired. My intention was to highlight some of the incredible floral notes that their cuisine tends to highlight including things like cinnamon.
user_30;user_30118.jpg;Life feels very frustrating today, but I’m still finding a way to smile through it all. 🙃🙃🙃 I’m posting this later than normal because of how crazy the day ended up actually being. Normally I put more emphasis on making everything look super pretty, but today was one of those days where half way through decorating I said screw it and just threw everything on top. Tried to make the mango nice, but then was like “I don’t care, we’re throwing passion fruit on top and lots of hemp seeds and I don’t care where the berries are”. It oddly was therapeutic and I got to eat my bowl of strawberry @culinayogurt, fruit and granola a lot faster because of it. 🙃 C’est la vie. . The granola I posted about will eventually make it to my blog tonight, but I’ve posted it a number of times already. Just in case, here is my stove top granola one more time. . Ginger Tahini Granola 2 cups rolled oats 1/4 cup tahini (make sure it’s runny) 1/4 cup maple syrup (you can use more if you like your granola more sweet) 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ground ginger 2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp salt or more to taste Optional: add in cacao nibs, pepitas or raisins . Add oats to a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Stir and toast oats for about 1-2 minutes. Add in seasonings and salt and toss to combine then add in remaining ingredients. Lower heat slightly, and continue to stir to prevent granola from burning for about 5-6 minutes. Lower heat again to low and allow to continue toasting while stirring for an additional 3-5 minutes. Granola should have a toasted golden color to them. Remove from heat and allow granola to completely cool before storing. Granola will continue to crisp up as it cools. But also really good hot off the stove too.
user_30;user_30119.jpg;Everything is overwhelming. 😣 It’s easy to go down a spiral of news stories, twitter trends and feel like you’re sinking in misery. I want to move away from that and use this time of social distancing to do something a little more productive with my time. I’ll be sharing some things throughout the week to help during this time and encourage you all to practice social distancing yourself. 🌼 . Feeling very privileged at the moment that I still have my staples in my fridge and pantry to keep me going. 🥣 For today, I made some yakisoba noodles according to the package (@jslfoods) and paired it with some baked tofu and massaged shredded greens and cabbage. Got a bunch of hardy greens and know they’ll last a lot longer than tender greens. They’ll also freeze fine just in case I can’t get to all of them at once. 🥬 . Easy Baked Tofu 1 block extra firm tofu, drained and pressed 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 2 tsp garlic chili sauce 1/2 tsp cornstarch . Preheat oven to 400F. Cut tofu into cubes and place In a Tupperware container. Add soy sauce and garlic chili. Sprinkle cornstarch over top evenly. Seal the container and gently shake to coat tofu. Take tofu and place individual pieces spread out over a lined sheet pan. Place in oven and bake for at least 20-25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Add tofu to dishes as desired. I just folded a serving of tofu into the noodles then served. 🌱 . Replacement Ideas ▪️Feel free to replace the tofu with canned chickpeas. Just drain and coat the same and bake as instructed. ▪️If you don’t have fresh greens, opt for frozen kale/spinach and sauté into the noodles. ▪️Tough vegetation like cabbage will last a bit longer than other greens because it’s much hardier. You can also quick pickle them by sprinkling with salt and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp maple syrup and massage with hands. Can be stored and used as needed.
user_30;user_30120.jpg;Making the most of these days ahead.🌻If anything, it’s definitely helping me to become creative with my resources. 🙃Got this new @gomacro flavor in the mail to try, Smooth Sanctuary, and it is a combo of double chocolate+peanut butter chips. Delicious on it’s own, but I wanted to try it in my oatmeal bake this morning because I’m out of chocolate chips and I’m only going out for essentials at this point if I have to.

user_30;user_30121.jpg;Greens and more greens. 🥗 And some other things too. ✨Really happy I got some kabocha squash last week. It lasted and made for a great addition to this salad. 🥒Just roasted that and some frozen broccoli and added some frozen edamame, cucumbers, hemp seeds and pepitas on top of some greens. 🥬 For the dressing I combined 1 tbsp tahini, 2 tsp sweet chili sauce, 1 tsp soy sauce and 1 tsp apple cider vinegar. Whisk together and add 1 tbsp water to thin out. 🥣
user_30;user_30122.jpg;I slept in a bit, did some regular grocery shopping, and now wanting to take a nap. But first late breakfast! Need some classic oats and loaded them with some flax seeds for some good omega 3s and lots of cinnamon, turmeric, and ginger.

user_30;user_30125.jpg;Hi rice. 🍚 Hi beans. 👋🏽 I miss you. Can’t wait to get home and make a pot of both. Loved this combo in particular. Made some pinto beans and paired it with some brown rice and roasted bell pepper. Made a simple tahini sauce using tahini, lemon juice and some adobo seasoning. Stir together and thin out with a little water until consistency and taste are to your liking. 👌🏽 . Pinto Beans 2 cans pinto beans 2 tbsp tomato paste 1/2 yellow onions, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 tsp smoked paprika 1/2 red bell pepper, diced 1 small sweet potato, peeled and diced 1/2 tsp cumin 1 tsp sazón (I used @eatloisa) 1/2 tsp oregano Juice of one orange 1 jalapeño, minced 2 1/2 cups of veggie broth 2 tsp maple syrup . In a large saucepan, sauté the onions until softened. Add in garlic, sweet potato and bell pepper and sauté until fragrant. Add in pinto beans, tomato paste, seasonings and jalapeño then stir to combine. Add in veggie broth and bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Allow to cook for 25-30 minutes, making sure sweet potato is fully cooked. At the end of cooking time add in orange juice and maple syrup and with the back of your spoon, lightly mash some of the pinto beans and stir well to thicken beans. Remove from heat. 🍊
user_30;user_30126.jpg;I’ll be very excited once I can cozy up to another bowl of tempeh, Forbidden Rice, carrots, zucchini and broccoli. 😌 Tempeh in general is a fav. I love it’s bitter undertones and I also love the fact that it doesn’t require me to press. Pretty much it’s ready to go out of the package. My favorite way of enjoying it is cut into strips and simmered with veggie broth, soy sauce, a little maple, Sriracha, minced garlic and minced ginger. To help take the edge off, I also like to squeeze a little citrus at the end (lime and orange are personal favs with tempeh). 🥕 . Maple Orange Tempeh 1 block tempeh, cut into strips 1/2 cup veggie broth 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp maple syrup 1/4 cup water 2 tsp Sriracha 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch ginger minced 2 tbsp orange juice (I like fresh) . In a pan, add tempeh and veggie broth. Bring to a low simmer and cover pan with a lid for 3-4 minutes. In a bowl whisk together remaining ingredients except orange juice and set aside. Once tempeh has steamed, remove lid and allow remaining veggie broth to absorb into tempeh at a medium heat. Pour in sauce and with a spatula lightly toss tempeh together to coat in sauce. Allow sauce to thicken and infuse into the tempeh. When tempeh starts to brown around the edges, add orange juice and cook for an additional minute. Remove from pan and serve. 🍊

user_30;user_30128.jpg;Got the last bits of light while taking this shot. ☀️ And as soon as I get another plantain, I’m going to be making this again for sure. I know I often bake my plantains, but for me, the starchy green variety when boiled is a staple and just so yummy when mashed (mangú—boiled plantains mashed in a little of the water they were cooked with plus often times oil, which for here I omitted). After mashing my plantains, I topped it with some quick adobo stewed chickpeas. 🔥 . Adobo Stewed Chickpeas 1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1 cup crushed tomatoes 1/2 red onion, diced 1/2 cup mushrooms, optional 1 tbsp tahini 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning (or to taste—I used @eatloisa) 3 cloves garlic 1 tsp oregano 1/4 tsp dry thyme 1 1/2 cups water or veggie broth Juice of half a lemon Handful of hearty veggies of choice (I used asparagus) . Add mushrooms and onions,to a medium pan and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add in tomatoes, chickpeas, tahini, adobo, thyme and oregano. Stir to fully combine and allow to cook while stirring for about a minute. Add in water, stir again and bring to a simmer. Allow to cook for about 15 to 20 minutes or until mixture begins to thicken. At the last 5 minutes of cooking, add your hearty veggie and allow to cook in the stew for the remaining time. Once cooked, squeeze with lemon juice and serve. ✨
user_30;user_30129.jpg;Being away from my kitchen is always a drag, but I make it work where I can. 🍓This bowl is no exception. Strawberries, bananas, pepitas, and stewed blueberries. . Banana Cinnamon Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 sliced banana 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk . Add ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow oats to cook and thicken while stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Then go ahead and top. 👏🏽 . If you’d like to make blueberry chia jam, add 1/2 cup frozen blueberries with 1 tsp chia seeds and a pinch of cinnamon to a small sauce pan. Feel free to sweeten with sugar or maple syrup if you need it to be a little sweeter. Stir and cook consistently as the berries warm through and release their juices. Berries should start to thicken, and you are welcome to lightly mash if you really want a good jam like consistency. Love these right off the stove in the winter, so warm and cozy. 🤤 If you can’t handle chia seeds you can also replace with a pinch of corn starch or agar agar to thicken as it cooks. 👏🏽
user_30;user_30130.jpg;Rice right out of the rice cooker is always 💯🔥🔥Had this @lotusfoods Forbidden Rice with some mango, shoshito peppers, broccoli, sweet and sour tofu and ginger. 🌱 Can’t wait to indulge in another bowl of this soon. 🙂 . Sweet and Sour Tofu 1 package extra firm tofu, drained 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar 2 tsp maple syrup 2 tsp ketchup 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 inch ginger, minced 2 tbsp water 1/4 tsp corn starch . Set oven to 400F. In a bowl combine all ingredients except tofu and whisk to combine then set aside. Cut tofu into desired shapes and pat dry with a paper towel. Place tofu on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes to remove moisture. Remove from oven. In a sauté pan add garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add sauce and then tofu. Stir to coat and cook allowing sauce to thicken. The serve and enjoy. :)
user_30;user_30131.jpg;Granola has become a fav recently. 🥣Love using it with some plant based yogurt by @culinayogurt (this is their bourbon vanilla and it is the best OMG). and especially loved adding some warm chia jam to it. 🍓If you’ve never made chia jam, it is super simple. Just get your fav frozen berry blend (or you can use fresh berries too), place 1 cup in the microwave for 1-2 minutes or until thawed and 1 tsp chia seeds, mix well and allow to sit for a 5 minutes to thicken. 🥄Stir and top over bowls like this or over cooked oats. Extra jam can be placed in the fridge to use later and thicken more for spreading over toast. 🤗
user_30;user_30132.jpg;Meal prep is looking good this week. 👀 Hands up for those meal prepping this week. 🙌🏽 Typically, I don’t prep this many containers at once, but, this is what my travel week is going to look like. To make life as easy and simple as possible, I batch cook a few items, store it in the fridge and prep my container with varying combos through out the week. Here’s a list of the things I will prep typically to get myself ready for the week: . ✅ 1-2 grains or starches (might toast a few sweet potatoes and cook some rice or quinoa in my rice cooker). Let cool and store. . ✅ Cut a lot of veggies/fruits. Pre-chop veggies for easy meals during the week as well as snacking. Get it done once early in the week or chop extra while prepping dinner for the next day. Wait to cut things that oxidize like avocados or squeeze with lemon juice or pack with sliced red onions to keep them from turning brown as quickly. . ✅ Make a few main components. Save time by cooking plant based proteins in the oven on a sheet pan. Section different parts of the pan with different sauces or seasonings (example pesto on half a block chopped tempeh and bbq sauce on the other half). . ✅ Make it a point to make 1 recipe you love to make meal prep more enjoyable and less redundant feeling. Having multiple parts helps. One night you can enjoy almond miso chickpeas with rice, the next day you can stuff it in a sweet potato topped with avocado slices or roll it into a burrito for lunch. 🌯 . Spicy Almond Miso Chickpeas (bottom container) 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/2 small red onion, diced 2-3 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch fresh ginger, minced 1 tsp garlic chili sauce 1 tsp miso + 1/4 cup warm water 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 1 tbsp almond butter 1/2 cup veggie broth or water . In a small bowl, add warm water and miso paste. Mix together with a fork to make sure miso is dissolved. In a pan, sauté onions and mushrooms until softened. Add in garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add chickpeas, soy sauce, garlic chili sauce, veggie broth, and sauce to fully combine. Allow to simmer and add in almond butter and miso mixture. Allow to thicken and absorb liquid. Enjoy!
user_30;user_30133.jpg;Happy Sunday! ☀️Definitely feeling some spring vibes and less cold this week. For those chilly mornings, I’ve still been appreciating warm bowls of oats like these. These vanilla oats went great with blueberries, kiwi, golden berries and some of my stove top granola. Recipe for the granola is below. 🙂 . Ginger Tahini Granola 2 cups rolled oats 1/4 cup tahini (make sure it’s runny) 1/4 cup maple syrup (you can use more if you like your granola more sweet) 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ground ginger 2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp salt or more to taste Optional: add in cacao nibs, pepitas or raisins . Add oats to a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Stir and toast oats for about 1-2 minutes. Add in seasonings and salt and toss to combine then add in remaining ingredients. Lower heat slightly, and continue to stir to prevent granola from burning for about 5-6 minutes. Lower heat again to low and allow to continue toasting while stirring for an additional 3-5 minutes. Granola should have a toasted golden color to them. Remove from heat and allow granola to completely cool before storing. Granola will continue to crisp up as it cools. But also really good hot off the stove too.
user_30;user_30134.jpg;Loved these chickpeas! 😙I often will definitely build my own spices, but sometimes I want to make a meal fast so I keep a few spice blends on hand to make things easy. I have definitely been craving Moroccan spices today as well as a lot of tomatoes, and was so happy with how this came together. Paired these stewed chickpeas with white rice and avocado. 🥑 . Moroccan Chickpeas 1 can diced tomatoes 1 can chickpeas 1 cup diced kabocha squash 3 cloves garlic 1 inch fresh ginger, minced 1/4 red onion, diced 2 tsp low sodium soy sauce 1 cup veggie broth 2 tsp Moroccan spice (or 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Garam Masala, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cumin) Salt and pepper to taste . In a medium pan add onions and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add in kabocha squash, tomatoes and remaining spices. Sauté until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

user_30;user_30137.jpg;Having a lot of bad luck with food this week apparently. 😂 Yesterday, ended up burning the roof of my mouth with hot food. Was too eager to eat and instantly regretted it. 🔥 Needed something soft and not irritating. So had some cooked oats that I let cool completely plus a few tablespoons plant based yogurt, berries and passion fruit. Very refreshing and super tasty. Kind of obsessed with the passion fruit right now. 😍 . Vanilla Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 cup unsweetened soy milk 1/2 tbsp ground flax seed 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp vanilla Pinch of salt 1 medjool date, mashed . In a saucepan add all ingredients and stir to combine. Allow oats to cook and thicken while stirring for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cook. Top or fold in optional vanilla vegan yogurt and serve with some extra fruit. ❤️
user_30;user_30138.jpg;Don’t mind me, I’ve been obsessed with tofu this week. 🔥 To change things up I made some smoked chili lime tofu. Paired this with avocado, @lotusfoods Organic White Jasmine Rice, greens, and sautéed bok choy, mushrooms and peppers in soy sauce and chili lime seasoning. 🌶 . Smoked Chili Lime Tofu 1 block extra firm tofu, drained and pressed 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 2 tsp garlic hot sauce 1/4 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 1/2 tsp chili lime seasoning . Preheat oven to 400F. Once tofu is pressed, cut into cubes. In a bowl combine all ingredients except tofu and mix together evenly. Add in tofu and with a spatula toss together until tofu is fully coated. Place tofu on a lined baking sheet and place in the oven for about 25 minutes. 🌱
user_30;user_30139.jpg;"Noodles, veggies chive pancakes. 🥒That’s what one of my meals looked like today. How about you? 💁🏽‍♀️ These pancakes were pretty simple and just topped all the deliciousness with some sweet citrus soy sauce (1 tbsp low soy sauce, 2 tsp maple syrup and squeeze of half a lime, 1 tsp Sriracha. Whisk together and pour over bowl or dunk pancakes into it.) ✨ . Chickpea Chive Pancakes 1 cup chickpea flour (if not a fan of chickpea flour feel free to use white flour) 1/2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp ginger powder 1/4 tsp Chinese five spice 2/3 cup soy milk 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 bunch Chinese chives or scallions . In a small bowl, add all dry ingredients. Add in chives and with a fork, mix with dry mixture.

Cook for an additional 4-5 minutes, flattening with spatula to make sure batter is fully cooked and slightly crispy. Remove from heat and serve (makes 8 pancakes; 2 per serving). 😌 .  Veggies included mushrooms and shishito peppers sautéed with garlic and some fresh cucumbers. I also used vermicelli noodles that I hydrated with hot water from my water kettle (super easy—just drain and use). 🌱"
user_30;user_30140.jpg;What do you like on top of your yogurt? 🙇🏽‍♀️ Always granola. I like texture and it just makes me super satisfied. 🥥 So had this yummy @culinayogurt blueberry lavender coconut yogurt with some homemade granola, mango, passion fruit and blueberries.

user_30;user_30141.jpg;Even though I regained my appetite, I wasn’t really big on eating today. 😅 Had no desire for beans, so tofu was the perfect solution. Did a simple tofu stirfry and paired it with @lotusfoods Organic White Jasmine Rice and a few pieces of steamed kabocha squash. 🙃 Kept the seasonings super basic because I didn’t want to over test my stomach. 🥺 . Used 1/3 of a block of tofu, handful of mushrooms, 2 baby bok choy, soy sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic, turmeric and sesame seeds. Start by sautéing the mushrooms until softened, add in garlic, tofu and Bok choy and sauté until garlic is fragrant. Add in 2 tsp low sodium soy sauce, 3 tbsp of water and pinch of turmeric. Sauté for 2 minutes allowing tofu to turn a light yellow color. Salt to taste. 🌱
user_30;user_30142.jpg;Banana or raspberries? Which toast would you choose? Keeping it basic today with some @daveskillerbread with peanut butter. One slice I topped with banana slices and the other I topped with raspberries (just mashed the berries with a fork when I added them to the toast. Both are topped with pepitas, hemp hearts and cacao nibs. 🤗 . Feeling much better today. Just had a 24 hour stomach bug. Thankfully my appetite is back and no more nausea. 🤭
user_30;user_30143.jpg;I know I normally post recipes daily, but dinner happened a little unexpectedly. 😅 Originally, I meant to make mung beans, just cook them till tender for the week. 🙇🏽‍♀️However, in my laziness, I cooked them in the instant pot and they became really mushy. So I drained some of the extra fluid and flavored them. Kind of looks like Dal, but I flavored them with @eatloisa adobo seasoning, cumin, soy sauce, hot sauce and added a little unsweetened soy milk to make them creamy and rich. Happened to workout really well with my mashed potatoes and sautéed veggies. 🥦 . Will definitely try remaking this again as it did come out really yummy. I’ll just make sure I have proper measurements for everything. 🌼
user_30;user_30144.jpg;Happy Sunday! Hoping it’s feeling warm for you like it is here. Spring is coming. 🌞One relaxing bowl for now and hoping to get back to a lot of messages today. 💫 .  Zoats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 a small zucchini, grated 1/2 tbsp chia seeds 1 medjool date 1/4 tsp cinnamon Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened almond milk .

Topped this bowl with peanut butter, banana, blueberries, dried mulberries, hemp hearts, cacao nibs, and pepitas. 💚
user_30;user_30145.jpg;It was clear the fridge time yesterday before traveling. 🥬 Had a delicious ripe plantain, lots of greens and some leftover fruit/veggies to get through. It all made an awesome salad. In case you need some inspiration, here’s what went into the salad. 🥗 . Chopped greens, roasted sweet ripe plantain (have instructions in my highlights), chopped cherry tomatoes, chopped golden berries (the orange guys, they have a great sweet/sour taste), roasted adobo chickpeas, sautéed broccoli, hemp hearts and tahini dressing (1 tbsp tahini with juice of half a lemon and 1/4 tsp adobo seasoning). 🔥 . Adobo Chickpeas 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 tsp garlic chili sauce 1 tbsp soy sauce 1/2 tsp adobo seasoning (@eatloisa) . Preheat oven to 400F. Take a paper towel and dry off chickpeas. Place chickpeas in a Tupperware container with other ingredients. Cover with a lid and shake well to coat chickpeas. Spread chickpeas on a lined baking sheet and roast chickpeas for 20 minutes, toss chickpeas and then bake for another additional 10 minutes. Allow to fully cool. 🌱
user_30;user_30146.jpg;🍫There are some days where I’m all in for baking and others where I’ll just get as far as mixing the batter and eating most of it before it gets into the oven (I have no shame). 👀 This brownie batter has a bit more nutrition to it like extra fiber without sacrificing the chocolate satisfaction I need sometimes. 💃🏽 . Brownie Batter 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup rolled or quick oats 1/2 cup almond butter (if you don’t mind pb flavor feel free to opt for peanut butter 👌🏽) 1/3 cup maple syrup 1 tsp vanilla 2 tbsp cocoa powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 cup unsweetened soy milk 1/3 cup chocolate chips . Place oats and black beans in a food processor and process on high for 30 seconds, place remaining ingredients except chocolate chips into the food processor and process until thick/smooth (smoothness will be determined by power of food processor). Once smooth, fold in chocolate chips with a spatula. Batter will be slightly warm, so the chocolate will melt slightly. Feel free to allow to fully cool and add more chocolate chips if desired. . This is meant as a fun little dip/spread or something you can absolutely eat by the spoonful (like I did). Really good on toast with sliced banana on top of mashed raspberries. 🤤 . Almond butter can be pricey, feel free to sub for peanut butter (will have more of a Reese’s peanut butter cup taste). To find cheaper jars of almond butter definitely check out the store brand options by Aldi’s, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. 💸
user_30;user_30147.jpg;Yay for the weekend!! 🤗 This plate of crispy baked tofu, mango, greens, carrot ribbons, @lotusfoods Forbidden Rice, and ginger. 🌱 Topped it with the Trader Joe’s Nori Komi Furikake seasoning.

user_30;user_30148.jpg;Passion fruit was on sale and it reminded me of a similar oatmeal combo so had to absolutely take advantage of this opportunity. Used the extra bit of oats I had leftover from prep and enjoyed this yummy bowl. 😋 . 2 cups rolled oats 4 cups unsweetened almond milk 2 tbsp ground flax seed 2 tsp vanilla extract 3 tbsp coconut cream (optional) 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp cardamom 1/4 tsp salt or more to taste . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and allow oats to cook and thicken for about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to completely cool. You will notice that oats will continue to thicken. Divide oats between 4 different containers for easy prep for the week. Place oats in fridge and when ready to serve, reheat with a little milk and stir then top with all the goodies. 🙂 Makes 4-5 servings depending on how hungry you are.
user_30;user_30149.jpg;It’s late, I know. 😴 But never too late for some yummy food. Recently, I made these Chili Garlic Chickpea Burgers, and these are just so enjoyable.

Take 1/4 cup of mixture and with slightly wet hands, mold mixture into a patty shape. Place patty on a lined baking sheet and repeat with remaining mixture (should form about 6-8 patties depending if you want to make them bigger in size). Bake 25 minutes, carefully flip and bake another 10-15 minutes or until burger is firm. Serve between burger buns or my fav way to enjoy these patties is with rice. 🍔
user_30;user_30150.jpg;Can someone just use magic to put this out in front of me again? 😭 Missing these bagels topped with some avocado smashed chickpeas. 🥑 .

Grate some zest from the lemon into the mash, then cut lemon in half and juice the lemon over top. Add in spring onions, garlic powder and stir to combine. Adjust flavor by adding some salt and pepper to taste. Take mixture and spread over your base of choice. I did the bagel and topped it off with some sautéed mushrooms, zucchini, red pepper flakes and everything but the bagel seasoning. 🥒 . I also really liked a little basil in this too when I had it again today, so feel free to add in if you have it on hand or any other toppings for your own preference. 👏🏽 For the mushrooms, place sliced mushrooms in a pan with a pinch of salt and allow water to cook off. Add a splash of soy sauce and a pinch of smoked paprika and garlic powder. Add a splash of vegetable broth to deglaze the pan and a touch of maple syrup. Cook until liquid is fully absorbed then top toast with it.
user_30;user_30151.jpg;Sometimes you get that little bit of a recipe that’s not exactly a serving, but you don’t want to throw it out. 🥣 My tip is typically to take that little bit and add some extra beans to it. So this helped me make the last serving of these Harissa lentils make a yummy and filling last serving. For that last bit I added 1/4 cup of beans I had on hand (this time it was chickpeas) and just stirred well to combine with the lentils. Then just let it sit overnight in the fridge to mingle. Heat up next day and enjoy. 💛 . Harissa Red Lentils 1/2 red onion, diced 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes 1 cup red lentils 1 bell pepper (I used orange) 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp cumin 2 tsp harissa spice 2 1/2 cups water 2 tsp soy sauce or coconut aminos 2 tsp maple syrup (optional) Salt to taste . In a medium sauce pan add onion and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and bell pepper and sauté until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add in tomatoes, soy sauce and spices then stir to combine. Add in lentils, maple syrup and water. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and allow to cook for about 20-25 minutes or until red lentils are cooked through and thick. Adjust salt to your preference, stir and serve. 🍚
user_30;user_30152.jpg;This week feels very scattered. Kind of matches my travel schedule too. 😂 Anyway, before I ran out the door, had this bowl of apple pie oatmeal. . Apple Pie Oats 1/2 cup oats (quick or rolled, doesn’t matter or you can opt for some quick steel cut varieties too) 1 tbsp ground flaxseed 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice Pinch cardamom 2 tbsp chopped dried apples Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (you can add more if you want them to be looser) 🌸 . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a low medium heat to simmer. With a spoon or spatula, stir oats as it cooks, about 3 minutes. Remove from stove top and top oatmeal as desired. For some apple goodness, I took a Fuji apple and thinly sliced it up to cook on the stove top. Add a tsp of sweetener of choice, pinch of cinnamon, pinch of salt and 1 tbsp water. Allow apples to cook and brown until soften then pour over oatmeal. 🍎
user_30;user_30153.jpg;Was really craving some tofu scramble, but we didn’t have any and I didn’t want to go out in the rain looking for it tonight. 🙃 So I just tweaked my typical recipe to turn it into a yummy chickpea scramble version instead. 💛 . Chickpea Scramble 1 can chickpeas, reserve chickpea fluid 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 tsp ground turmeric 1/2 tsp miso paste 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/4 medium red onion diced 3 tbsp unsweetened soy milk 1 tsp hot sauce Salt and pepper to taste . Add mushrooms and onions to a pan and allow to cook until onions are softened. Add chickpeas and garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add in turmeric, soy sauce, and 1/4 cup reserved chickpea fluid (aquafaba) to the pan. With the back of your cooking spoon, mash 1/3 of the chickpeas. Add in miso paste, hot sauce and soy milk and stir together to fully combine. Continue to cook as liquid thickens around the chickpeas. Add in salt and pepper to taste then serve as desired. I always go with rice (went with some Forbidden Rice from @lotusfoods), but this goes well with some sweet potato hash browns or regular sautéed potatoes if wanting a more breakfast feel. 🥔
user_30;user_30154.jpg;So I actually made a big batch of oatmeal over the weekend. 🥣 Took the extra and just put them in individual containers to reheat throughout the beginning of the week. Definitely made breakfast easy. You can reheat on the stove top with a few splashes of milk or place in microwave with a few splashes of milks comes. Just mix and eat. Topped this one with blackberries, mango, blueberries, hemp hearts, pepitas. 🥭 . 2 cups rolled oats 4 cups unsweetened almond milk 2 tbsp ground flax seed 2 tsp vanilla extract 3 tbsp coconut cream (optional) 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp cardamom 1/4 tsp salt or more to taste . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and allow oats to cook and thicken for about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to completely cool. You will notice that oats will continue to thicken. Divide oats between 4 different containers and top as desired. Place oats in fridge and when ready to serve, reheat with a little milk and stir.
user_30;user_30155.jpg;Lots of random combos in this plate, but it all came together some how. 👌🏽 Baked some ripe plantains, sautéed some veggie noodles my friend Katie left me and paired that with some black beans (recipe below), avocado and extra greens. 🥬 The black beans are flavored with some soy sauce and gochujang (all I had in the fridge because we hadn’t gone grocery shopping). Spicy and tasty, went well with the plantains in my opinion. 🌶 . Spicy Black Beans 1 can black beans, drained not rinsed 1 red bell pepper 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce 1 tsp gochujang 1/2 cup water 1/4 medium red onion 2-3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp chili lime seasoning . In a saucepan, add onion and sauté until softened. Add in red bell pepper and garlic and sauté until fragrant. Add in black beans, gochujang, soy sauce, chili lime seasoning and water. Bring to a simmer and allow beans to cook and thicken for 5-8 minutes. Serve as desired.
user_30;user_30156.jpg;Sometimes when we look at processed foods, we automatically assume that it’s all bad. But here are a couple of things to note regarding processed foods: . ➕Not all processed foods are the same. Some have really great quality ingredients and may even help to boost your fiber intake and provide some critical nutrients. . ➕They don’t have to be for everyone. But for many it can make a huge impact in terms of time and convenience. For example, there are mornings I can’t get to making oats on the stove top, so I use instant oats instead. . For breakfast made some instant oats (no stove top involved). Topped it with persimmon slices, nibs, pepitas, hemp hearts and @ripplefoods plain yogurt (6g plant protein, only 3 grams of added sugar, which is amazing and tastes really good, nice and creamy too). Recipe and directions for oats below! 🧡 . Instant Oats 1/2 cup quick oats 1 tbsp chia seeds Pinch of cinnamon Pinch of ginger Pinch of salt 1-2 dates diced 3/4 cup hot water (boiled mine in a tea pot) . Add ingredients to a bowl and stir to fully combine. Allow to sit for 2 minutes for liquid to fully absorb and stir again to make sure everything is well combined. Top as desired and enjoy. 🥣
user_30;user_30157.jpg;There can be a lot of recipes out on the internet that can make a plant based approach to eating seem super complicated. ✨ If you’re new, focus on the familiar and the easy things. One of my favorite meals I make often doesn’t involve much and can be adjusted based on how simple you want it. See some tips below plus what I actually made: . MEAL: Cooked some @lotusfoods Forbidden Rice using a rice cooker, chopped up some cucumber, used a veggie peeler and made carrot ribbons, thawed some frozen edamame by running it under some warm water, sautéed some broccoli with soy sauce (you can sub for coconut aminos or your fav teriyaki sauce). Topped with avocado, pickled ginger and extra soy sauce. . MAKE IT SIMPLER ➕Use frozen roasted veggies. Brands like Green Giant and even places like Trader Joe’s sell frozen pre-roasted veggies that just need to be reheated (love Trader Joe’s roasted cauliflower and fire roasted corn a lot). . ➕Use easy veggies you don’t have to over prepare (think cherry tomatoes, baby carrots, cucumbers, asparagus, green beans, etc.). . ➕ Pop veggies you want to cook on a sheet pan and focus on classic flavors (garlic, salt, pepper and a little oil if you prefer go a long way). Pop in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 375F. . ➕Use short cuts. It’s okay to microwave things. Don’t let anyone shame you for using frozen or canned veggies/fruits. If you are doing things to help increase your veggie intake, then you are doing a fantastic job. . ➕ Frozen grains are a god send especially if you don’t have time to cook your own from scratch. . I guess my biggest advice is to do the best you can. Everyone’s best is different, and that is okay. If you like making everything from scratch, go for it! I love cooking so it doesn’t bother me. But for people that hate cooking, have to feed more than themselves, are limited in resources...focus on the things you have control over. Be kind to yourself. ❤️
user_30;user_30158.jpg;Gorgeous day outside. Feels like it should be spring already. Hoping the day is just as lovely for you. 👏🏽 Perfect day for some ginger oats. ✨ . Ginger Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds Pinch of cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground ginger 1 cup unsweetened almond . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir to allow oats to thicken. Serve with some fun toppings and enjoy. 🥣
user_30;user_30159.jpg;Simple meals will always be my preferred go to. 🥣 This bowl is very simple. Just some sauted broccoli, cucumber, thawed edamame, cilantro, baked Japanese sweet potato, miso tahini, and sriracha. 🌶 . This is exactly how I sauté my veggies. I like broccoli and mushrooms so typically I will go with these options but feel free to change our mushrooms for onions or broccoli for another veggie you like. Start with placing sliced mushrooms in a sauté pan. Add a pinch of salt and sauté until browned slightly, about 3-4 minutes. Add broccoli florets and 2-3 tbsp of water or veggie broth and cover with a lid. Allow to steam for 3-4 minutes or until broccoli is bright green. Remove lid and add 2 tsp soy sauce and 1 tsp garlic chili sauce and sauté until liquid is absorbed. You can replace the chili sauce with some minced garlic or 1/4 tsp garlic powder. 🍠🥦🌶
user_30;user_30160.jpg;Happy Saturday friends. 👯‍♀️Hanging out with my bestie today, so sorry this is a little late Hope you’re all up to something fun or at least relaxing. 🥣 . Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ground flaxseed 1 cup almond milk 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1 medjool date, diced . Add ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and allow to thicken for 5 minutes. As oats thicken, lightly mash date to spread out evenly into your oats.

user_30;user_30161.jpg;Hello weekend, I missed you. Hello noodles, I missed you too. 👀 Finished my last session for the day and found myself making ramen noodles with all the veggies and tofu. 🍜 . I just cooked a set of @lotusfoods rice ramen. Didn’t use a seasoning packet, just added a splash of soy sauce after it finished cooking. Baked some tofu and then added it to some sautéed mushrooms and broccoli that I tossed with soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic powder and sesame seeds. Topped this over the noodles and it was so good even if it was super simple. Enjoyed with some avocado and now I’m satisfied. 😌 .  Garlic Chili Tofu 1 block extra firm tofu drained and pressed for at least an hour 2 tbsp tamari 1 tbsp nutritional yeast 2 tsp chili garlic sauce . Set oven to 400F. After pressing tofu, cut tofu into even cubes and place in a bowl or Tupperware container. Add remaining ingredients, and if using a bowl just gently toss together. If using a tupperware container, seal container and gently shake contents to evenly coat tofu. Remove tofu and place on a lined baking sheet making sure tofu cubes aren’t touching. Place in oven for at least 25 minutes or until edges have browned. Remove from oven and serve as desired.

user_30;user_30164.jpg;I get a lot of questions regarding the type of peanut butter I use. 🥜Honestly, it’s nothing special, just natural peanut butter (I’ve tried multiple brands including and most often store brands with the same results). 💫Just look for peanut butter that has just peanuts and salt in the ingredients. When you open your jar, take a long butter knife and make sure to mix the oils into the nut butter to make sure it’s creamy. If your nut butter is firm, you can always place the nut butter on something warm like oats or in the microwave for 10 seconds with a tiny bit of water to loosen it up (just mix well using a fork). This works well for the nut butter at the bottom of the jar that tends to be a little less creamy. 🥜 . Zoats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1/4 tsp cinnamon Pinch of salt 1 tsp chia seeds 1/2 small zucchini, grated 1 date or small banana, diced 1 cup unsweetened almond 1-2 tbsp coconut cream (optional) . Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes or until oats are nice and fluffy. Adjust salt to taste and if needed, feel free to sweeten more as desired. Love to add some extra nut butter and fruit on top of mine for more flavor. ❤️ In case you’re wondering what the orange things are, they are golden berries. They have a sweet/tart flavor to them. 😌
user_30;user_30165.jpg;Buying different spice blends can be super helpful for making a quick dinner out of nothing. 🌶 I almost forgot about this harissa spice in my cabinet. Harissa is a dry chili pepper blend that can include things like coriander, smoked paprika and caraway. You can also find variations that might include things like mint in it. The most important part is the dry chili base. So as you can imagine, this can get spicy (but I’m obsessed with spicy). The blend I have really pronounces the caraway in it, but I love the smokiness it offers. I decided to use some in my lentils instead of some chili powder. If you have a savory spice blend you are looking to use, you can always sub it in place of the harissa. I often use these same ratios if I want a red lentil chili and just use chili powder instead. So have fun. 🤗 Using the red lentils makes this dish come together really fast, so it’s a great quick meal on those busy nights. 😌 . Harissa Red Lentils 1/2 red onion, diced 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes 1 cup red lentils 1 bell pepper (I used orange) 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tsp cumin 2 tsp harissa spice 2 1/2 cups water 2 tsp soy sauce or coconut aminos 2 tsp maple syrup (optional) Salt to taste . In a medium sauce pan add onion and sauté until softened. Add in garlic and bell pepper and sauté until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add in tomatoes, soy sauce and spices then stir to combine. Add in lentils, maple syrup and water. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and allow to cook for about 20-25 minutes or until red lentils are cooked through and thick. Adjust salt to your preference, stir and serve. 🍚 . Paired the lentils with @lotusfoods red rice, avocado, spring onion and red chili flakes because I can’t get enough heat. 🔥
user_30;user_30166.jpg;The shredded coconut I add on top of this looks like snow. 😆 Luckily, we don’t have any of that today. Just nice sunshine. I’ve also noted that the days have slowly started to get a little longer. 👀 I’m excited. So excited! 💃🏽 Enough of that, on to the food. Made some cardamom oats this morning and topped them with blackberries, bananas, walnuts, blueberries, coconut, cacao nibs and hemp hearts. 🤍 . Cardamom Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds or ground flax seeds Pinch of cardamom Pinch of cinnamon 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional) 1 medjool date, diced 1 cup unsweetened almond milk Pinch of salt . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring mixture to a simmer. Allow to cook and thicken while stirring for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve with your favorite toppings. 😌
user_30;user_30167.jpg;"I was mainly inspired to make these after having a black bean burger the last time I was in Staten Island. 🍔 It was good, but it didn’t live up to the promise of chipotle or plantains in it. So I decided to give a crack at this. These can be used for burgers or as a patty to serve with other grains and veggies. I highly recommend fries and mixing up some avocado and mango salsa to put over top of these (only a mix of half a mango, half an avocado, a handful of cherry tomatoes, juice of half a lime and 1/2 tsp chili lime seasoning; just mix and serve). Styling inspired by @cookingforpeanuts. ❤️ . Chipotle Black Bean Burgers 2 tbsp ground flaxseed 4 tbsp water 1 plantain (I recommend ripe if you can for more sweetness)* 5-6 baby Bella mushrooms, roughly chopped 1/4 medium red onion, roughly chopped 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained 1 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chipotle powder 2 tsp sazón 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tsp garlic chili sauce 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 2 tbsp creamy peanut butter . Set oven to 375F. In a medium mixing bowl, combine water and flaxseed and set aside for at least 5 minutes while prepping other ingredients. Peel ripe plantain and place on a lined baking sheet along with mushrooms and onions and bake for at 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside for a moment. In a food processor, add oats, beans, garlic and everything from the baking tray. Give it a few pulses to break everything up and continue to pulse until the crumbly mixture can start to hold shape. Dump contents into the mixing bowl with the flax egg and add all remaining ingredients. Start mixing the ingredients together with your hands to help incorporate the spices. To make forming patties easier, clean hands and leave them slightly wet (should help prevent sticking) form 6-8 evenly shaped patties. Place patties on a lined baking tray and place in the oven for 15 minutes, flip and bake for another 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven and serve with salsa. . Can be stored in the fridge or freezer. Make sure to individually separate each patty with parchment paper to prevent sticking together. . I used a ripe (yellow) plantain for this. If you have a green plantain, boil instead."
user_30;user_30168.jpg;Was hoping to squeeze in a walk at the park, but it just started snowing. 🌨 Looks like those plans are on hold for now.

user_30;user_30169.jpg;Hoping everyone had a good start to the week. 🙇🏽‍♀️Just sitting here planning content and finishing up this bowl of yum here. Had some extra kamut (a grain that is similar to wheat berries) in the pantry and paired that with some pressure cooked black beans (kept them plain to use through out the week) and some sautéed brussel sprouts with onion, and extra greens. Topped this all with some fiesta sauce I had left over from last week. 💃🏽 .  Fiesta Sauce 1 tsp miso paste ¼ cup almond flour 3 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 small sweet potato 1 cup unsweetened plain almond milk, heated in the microwave for a minute ¼ small onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed lightly with knife 2 tsp hot sauce 1 tsp smoke paprika ½ tsp chipotle powder ½ tsp cumin Salt to taste . Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Peel a small sweet potato, then cut into small cubes and place in the boiling water for about 6-8 minutes or until potatoes can be pierced easily. Strain potatoes using a colander and place in a blender. [Next step is optional] In the pan you just emptied, add onion and garlic and sauté until onions are softened, about 3 minutes. Dump garlic and onion into the blender with the potato along with other remaining ingredients except salt. Cover blender and blend on high until sauce is fully smooth. When done blending, taste sauce and add salt to taste (personally, I didn’t think it needed any additional salt, but everyone’s taste buds are different, so adjust accordingly). Adjust consistency with extra milk or water as desired.
user_30;user_30170.jpg;Had a lot of fun decorating my bowl this morning (maybe too much fun 🤔). But I love my morning routine so it never feels like a burden to do so. Don’t feel like you have to match my bowl exactly as it will taste the same even if you threw your fruit on top whichever way is easiest....beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. Had a lot of berries today and kept my oats simple so I could enjoy all the unique flavors of the fruit. 🍓 . Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds or ground flax seeds 1/2 tsp cinnamon Splash of vanilla extract (optional) 1/2 a sliced banana 1 cup unsweetened almond milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow to cook and thicken while stirring for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Then top how you desire.

user_30;user_30173.jpg;Had a lot of fun exploring some fun food in NYC today. Gave me lots of ideas for some fun future recipes. 😌 In the mean time, sharing a fun bowl I did enjoy this week (technically for lunch, but can easily be made a dinner option). Some balsamic glazed veggies featuring chickpeas as the main plant based protein source and tossed with lots of extra veggies. Savory with a light sweetness. Was really excited with how good this one came out. 🥦 . Balsamic Glaze Stir Fry 1 can chickpeas 1 small head of broccoli cut into florets 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/2 small red onion, diced 3 tbsp water 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp coconut aminos or soy sauce 2 tsp maple syrup 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 inch fresh ginger, minced 1/2 tsp dry thyme Pinch of cornstarch . In a small bowl combine balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, coconut aminos and corn starch. In a pan start by sautéing onions and mushrooms until onions are softened. Add in chickpeas, broccoli and water, then cover pan and allow to steam for about 4 minutes or until broccoli is bright green.

Serve with grain of choice (I chose quinoa). 🥣
user_30;user_30174.jpg;Something different for breakfast. 🥦I know I always post oats, but if that’s not your jam, then maybe meal prepping some of these tofu cups will help for those that want something savory. 👌🏽Pretty simple good, just pick your veggies and sauté them then blend the tofu base. Stir it all together and bake. I baked them in a muffin tin to make it easy to refrigerate and/or freeze for eating through out the week. You can use the cups as snacks, add to sandwich buns for a breakfast sandwich, or add to a bowl like I did. Paired it with a Japanese sweet potato, broccoli and some hummus. 😌 .

user_30;user_30176.jpg;Happy love day. Hoping that you all are loving yourselves a lot today. Showed myself some love by making a chocolate brownie oatmeal bake for one (don’t worry Gregory I’m making you one too). 💘 . Chocolate Brownie Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp almond butter 1 tsp ground flax seed 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/4 tsp baking soda 1 tbsp maple syrup 1/2 a mashed ripe banana 1/3 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk 1-2 tbsp chocolate chips Pinch of salt . Preheat oven to 350F. Combine all dry ingredients in a single serve oven dish or ramekin. Add remaining ingredients and stir to fully combine. Place in oven and bake for 25 minutes.

user_30;user_30177.jpg;I have to be really in the mood for a tomato sauce with my pasta. 🍝Typically I like non-tomato based sauces (nothing against tomatoes). So in search of a yummy sauce to use for lunch, I was highly influenced by pinterest after seeing a couple of taco pasta bowls. So I decided that I really wanted to make a fun chipotle flavored sauce for my pasta. The following fiesta sauce is what resulted, and ommmmg, sooooo good. I debated just drinking the sauce instead of pouring it over my pasta. 😂 Was glad there was sauce left to use for the pasta though because it was exactly how I had envisioned. 🥰 . This makes about 1 ½ cups of sauce that you can use for anything. 🤤 I used some for pasta, but you can drizzle it over salads, use it to dress up burrito bowls, to dip veggies or even to top tacos. As I mentioned this morning, I’m trying to creatively use up the almond flour I purchased, so you will see it in the ingredients. Alternatively, I imagine you can use 1/3 cup soaked cashews if you prefer. 🥣 . My pasta bowl used a serving of @eatbanza shell pasta, 1/4 cup of sauce, and then some other sauted veggies including onion, peppers, mushrooms and corn. . Fiesta Sauce 1 tsp miso paste ¼ cup almond flour 3 tbsp nutritional yeast 1 small sweet potato 1 cup unsweetened plain almond milk, heated in the microwave for a minute ¼ small onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed lightly with knife 2 tsp hot sauce 1 tsp smoke paprika ½ tsp chipotle powder ½ tsp cumin Salt to taste . Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Peel a small sweet potato, then cut into small cubes and place in the boiling water for about 6-8 minutes or until potatoes can be pierced easily. Strain potatoes using a colander and place in a blender. [Optional] In the pan you just emptied, add onion and garlic and sauté until onions are softened, about 3 minutes. Dump garlic and onion into the blender with the potato along with other remaining ingredients except salt. Cover blender and blend on high until sauce is fully smooth. When done blending, taste sauce and add salt to taste (personally, I didn’t think it needed any additional salt, but everyone’s taste buds are different, so adjust accordingly).
user_30;user_30178.jpg;I used to buy things very impulsively. 🙃I might use it once and then forget about that ingredient because I wouldn’t normally use it regularly. 😬 While I’ve gotten better with this and only buy things I need and plan to use, I still have a lot of random ingredients just sitting in my pantry and trying to get through them now. 🛒One of those ingredients is almond flour. I use it very rarely but at the moment trying to use it up effectively. Today, I added some almond flour to my oats, and it came out super yummy. What’s that one ingredient you have that you bought a lot of and are struggling to use up? I know this can’t be just me. 😂 . Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp almond flour 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp chia seeds 1 cup almond milk 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1 medjool date . Add ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and allow to thicken for 5 minutes. As oats thicken, lightly mash date to spread out evenly into your oats. Serve and top with extra fruit. 🍓 I used strawberries, blueberries, hemp hearts, roasted buckwheat, cacao nibs and pepitas. This went well with my almond biscotti tea. Was trying to have that all match. 😗
user_30;user_30179.jpg;Really enjoyed the heck out of this salad. 🥦The base of this salad included a mix of about 2 cups chopped spring mix 🥬, 6 sprigs cilantro roughly chopped, 1 minced spring onion and lemon pepper seasoning. Just tossed those ingredients together and placed at the bottom of my plate. Then topped with shredded carrots, quinoa, sliced cucumber 🥒, avocado 🥑 and these miso lime chickpeas sautéed with broccoli. 🥦Insanely good, flavor all through out. 👏🏽 . Miso Lime Chickpeas (makes to servings) 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 cup broccoli florets 3 tbsp veggie broth . Miso Lime Sauce 2 tbsp lite soy sauce or coconut nut aminos Juice of one small limes 1 tsp miso paste 1/4 tsp ground ginger 1/4 tsp garlic powder Pinch of corn starch 2 tsp sesame seeds . In a small bowl combine everything listed in the sauce ingredients and whisk together until smooth. Set bowl aside and heat up a sauté pan to medium heat. Add chickpeas, broccoli and veggie broth. Cover with a lid and allow to cook for about 4 minutes. Remove the lid and add sauce. Stir until sauce thickens and coats chickpeas and broccoli. Serve and enjoy. ✨
user_30;user_30180.jpg;Hey guys! 👋🏽 Hope you’re enjoying your week. Thought it might be helpful to remind you guys that you don’t have to fall into expensive habits to be a good vegan or have tasty foods. In a world where everyone goes for dates or super expensive nut butters...be a raisin. 🍇 . I’m kidding, but also not kidding. I often use dates because I like them, but it sometimes makes me forget how much more awesome raisins are for sweetening or enhancing food. Did I also mention they are hella cheaper??? 🤑 But lets not forget all the things raisins happen to be better at than dates for the same amount: . ✔️ Double the amount of iron ✔️ More calcium ✔️ More potassium . Don’t worry. I still love dates. I will continue to eat dates because they have a different sweet taste compared to dates and regardless of the source provide a good amount of fiber, but I won’t forget that my raisins can provide me with lots of sweet benefit on the cheap. 💚 . Vanilla Raisin Oatmeal 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 tbsp chia seeds or ground flaxseed 1/2 tsp vanilla extract Pinch of cinnamon 2 tbsp raisins 1 cup unsweetened almond milk . Combine everything together in a sauce pan. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook and thicken while stirring for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve with extra toppings. ✨ . PSA I know the bowl might look this way but it’s for presentation. I added a little more fruit that was leftover from decorating. All the seeds I purchased were either on super clearance or bought in bulk to save money. You can scope it out on my stories. 👏🏽
user_30;user_30181.jpg;There are days I don’t want to cook. 🧅Today was one of those days. I used as few ingredients as I could use and chose the easiest veggies to cook. 😂 Here’s whats in my bowl today: . ➕Sazón Lime Chickpeas: Take one can chickpeas, rinse and drain. Toss chickpeas with a few splashes of coconut aminos or low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp chili lime seasoning and 1/2 tsp @eatloisa sazón. Toss and place in air frier for 10-15 minutes at 370 depending on how crispy you want them. . + Sautéed Sazón Vegetables: start by sautéing 1/4 diced red onion and 4 sliced baby mushrooms until softened. Add in 1/2 sliced zucchini, 1/2 a diced bell pepper and 1/2 tsp sazon, and 1/2 tsp chili lime seasoning and stir to allow veggies to cook to cook. Add in 2 tsp coconut aminos or low sodium soy sauce. Sauté until veggies are coated and liquid is absorbed. Optional, but tasty, add the zest of a lime and squeeze the juice of half a small lime over top. . ➕Forbidden rice from @lotusfoods cooked in my rice cooker. Made a bunch so I have rice for the rest of the week. . Toppings: Mashed avocado, red chili flakes, cilantro and extra lime juice. 😌
user_30;user_30182.jpg;"Alright! Like I promised. Here is my baked oatmeal. 🥣One of the reasons I wanted to highlight this is that I know textures can play a big part in people’s enjoyment of food. When we think of oats we can often think only of oatmeal, but maybe you hate creamy textures. My solution, if you like crunchy make granola; if you want to feel like you’re eating cake, try it baked. 🧁 . This will be going on the blog, but for now a rough draft of the recipe in case you want to make it yourself. Pretty easy, this makes a single serving, but you can also make a bigger batch in a bigger dish to have for the week too. Here are the basics. . Blueberry Baked Oatmeal 1/2 cup oats 1 medjool date or 2 tsp maple syrup 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/4 tsp baking soda 2 tbsp walnuts 1/2 tbsp ground flax seed Pinch of salt Pinch of cinnamon 2 tbsp apple sauce or 1/2 a small banana mashed 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk 2 tbsp blueberries . Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor or mini blender, add oats, walnuts, and date to the container and pulse it a few times until mixture is crumbly. Place mixture into an oven safe dish or ramekin and add remaining dry ingredients. Then add in mashed banana and milk. Mixture should be thick (if for some reason the mixture is still dry, add in 1-2 tbsp extra milk). Fold in blueberries and then place dish into the oven for about 25-35 minutes (cook to 35 minutes if you want a muffin like consistency). 💚 Remove from oven and just let it cool for 5-10 minutes before digging in. 👏🏽 . Note: if you are noticing some green bits in my oats, I added some grated zucchini to this version because I wanted to (think zucchini bread). To modify, I used 1/3 cup oats, 1/2 small grated zucchini, and did 1/4 cup almond milk (all other ingredients were the same). 🥣 . Pro Tip: combine ingredients the night before in a baking dish and allow to sit in fridge overnight. When ready, just pop in the oven and bake while you get ready for work. ✨ . Top as desired. I did banana, peanut butter and blueberries with some cacao nibs and hemp hearts to garnish. Make it your own. 😌"
user_30;user_30183.jpg;I am definitely a creamy stew, curry and daal lover. ✨ One thing that sometimes is challenging is making sure that it doesn’t turn out watery. 💧 This particular daal I made with mung beans, was watery because I used cooked beans and they weren’t absorbing a lot of liquid or thickening the pot. But adding a little corn flour made it the perfect consistency without altering the flavor. Came out amazing. I also left out the coconut milk for some of you that deal with coconut allergies. Still creamy and still flavorful and rich. 💚 . Mung Daal 1 cup cooked mung beans or 1/2 cup regular lentils 1/4 red onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 inch fresh ginger, minced 1 small carrot, diced 1/2 medium zucchini, diced 1/2 tsp Cumin 1/4 tsp Turmeric 1/4 tsp Mustard seeds 6 cardamom pods, shell lightly cracked open 4-5 sprigs cilantro, diced 1 1/2 cups veggie broth 1/2 cup unsweetened almond or cashew milk 1 tbsp corn flour . In a medium sauce pan add onion and sauté until softened. Add in carrots, spices and seasonings and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant, continuing to stir to prevent burning. Add in beans, veggie broth and milk. Stir to combine and bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Allow to cook for 20-25 minutes. Remove cardamom pods. If watery, add in corn flour and stir to fully combine. Allow to thicken and feel free to add extra veggies like spinach or broccoli to your daal and allow to soften before serving if desired. Top or stir in cilantro for extra flavor/garnish. 🥣 . Greg was a huge fan of this. Almost ate the half I saved for lunch tomorrow. 😂 Made 2-3 decent sized portions depending on how hungry you are. 🥣
user_30;user_30184.jpg;It’s a miracle that I get yummy tasting strawberries at this point, but here we are. 🍓They were so beautiful and red that I couldn’t pass up. So in the bowl they went with some cacoa nibs, hemp hearts, pepitas, and banana. The perfect toppings for this vanilla oatmeal. 🥰 . Vanilla Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1 cup unsweetened soy milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow to cook while stirring for about 5 minutes or until oats have thickened. Pour into bowl and top as desired. 🍓
user_30;user_30185.jpg;A lovely Sunday. 💞Just needed a break from a lot of things, but now ready for the week ahead. Ended the night with this Stirfry. Just sautéed 1/2 cup mushroom and onions until onions softened. Then added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 inch ginger (minced). Add 1/2 cup cold rice and 1/2 cup beans of your choice. Add 2 tsp of soy sauce or coconut aminos and a handful of spinach then stir until liquid fully absorbed. Add optional sweetener like maple syrup or add some raisins to help sweeten. Feel free to add a little heat with 1-2 tsp Sriracha if desired. 🌶 Threw in some extra cauliflower I had yesterday. Simple, but so good. 🥬
user_30;user_30186.jpg;Happy Sunday everyone. ❤️ If you’ve ever wondered what the life of a food blogger looks like when they have only an hour to get ready to go out and they still have to make a breakfast post...this picture tells a part of the story. 😂 Made these maca oats while getting changed, doing my hair and chopping up the toppings. Of course when you’re in a rush the oats can feel like an eternity on the stove top, but I still managed this photo and immediately after packed it away to eat in the car while I finished my hair. 💁🏽‍♀️Surprisingly (or maybe not), the hair is the thing that takes the most time. I still managed to leave on time tho. ✌🏽 . Maca Oats 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1/2 tsp maca powder 1/2 a banana sliced up 1/4 tsp cinnamon Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened soy milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Once at a simmer, allow to cook and thicken while stirring for 5 minutes and then remove from the stove top. Top as desired, but I went with some strawberries, banana, blueberries, pepitas, cacao nibs and hemp hearts. So yummy. 😌
user_30;user_30187.jpg;Got so many veggies today and had to make this epic salad. 🥗 Can’t 👏🏽recommend 👏🏽this 👏🏽combo 👏🏽enough. 👏🏽 . In a bowl combine 2 handfuls of chopped spring greens, 1 carrot sliced into thin coins, 1 mini cucumber sliced thin, 1/2 cup cooked quinoa, 5 mint leaves diced well, 1 spring onion sliced thin, 1/2 cup edamame and roasted cauliflower (recipe below). Toss together and add to a serving bowl. Top with a miso tahini sauce (juice of half a lemon + 1 spoonful of tahini + 1/2 tsp miso paste. With a fork or spoon, mix this mixture together well until it thickens and the miso is evenly incorporated. Add a tbsp or splash of water to thin out slightly). Once at the consistency of your liking pour sauce over salad. 🥬 . Chili Garlic Cauliflower 1 cup fresh cauliflower 1 spoonful tahini (or other nut/seed butter of preference) 2 tsp soy sauce or coconut aminos 1 tsp chili garlic sauce A sprinkle of lemon pepper seasoning . Preheat oven for 400F. In a bowl combine everything except cauliflower. When we’ll combine add cauliflower and toss to coat. Spread cauliflower on a lined baking sheet and place in oven for at least 20-25 minutes or once the edges of the cauliflower crisp up.
user_30;user_30188.jpg;Happy Saturday! 🥣 I slept in a bit, but still felt pretty productive this morning. One of the things on my to do list was to have this oat bowl. Had to because the mango was ripe. And by now for most of you that know me, mango is my favorite. For those new, hi! 👋🏽 My name is Catherine and my obsession with mango is real. 🥭 Used a little less oats so that I could fit more toppings on my bowl today. 🙈 . Basic Oatmeal 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1/4 tsp cinnamon Pinch of salt 1/2 banana sliced up 1 cup unsweetened soy milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow to cook for about 5 minutes while stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from heat and serve. . I topped today’s bowl with mango, banana slices, blueberries, coconut flakes, pepitas, roasted buckwheat, and hemp hearts. 🤗
user_30;user_30189.jpg;A good way to end a good week! 👏🏽Some unanticipated good news and a delicious bowl of food. 😋 Kept it with simple foods. So let’s go through the yum. 😌 . ➕Frozen edamame, literally just heated it up in the microwave. . ➕Organic Red Rice thanks to @lotusfoods. Cooked in their rice cooker to perfection. . ➕Some vegan kimchi from @nasoya. . ➕ Sautéed veggies. Start by sautéing 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, allowing to brown slightly. Add zucchini and sauté for 2-3 minutes to brown as well. Add in kale then add in garlic powder, 2 tsp soy sauce and 1 tsp garlic chili sauce. Sauté until kale is wilted and liquid fully absorbed. 💚 . ➕Finally top with avocado and some everything but the bagel seasoning from Trader Joe’s. . All so good and satisfying! Have a good night! 🌙
user_30;user_30190.jpg;A bit dreary out today, but nothing that a bowl of matcha latte oats cann’t fix. 🍵 Ate this, took my B12, algae DHA/EPA and vit D, and feeling like a million bucks. 💪🏽 If you have any questions regarding the supplements I take, I explain them in depth in a highlight on my profile called Supplements. Feel free to ask questions below too. 👏🏽 . Matcha Latte Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 cup unsweetened soy milk 1 tsp chia seeds 2 tbsp coconut cream (optional) 1/2 banana sliced up Pinch of salt to taste 1/2 tsp matcha powder + 2 tbsp hot water . In a small bowl add matcha powder. With a spoon or a matcha whisk, gently break up any clumps in the powder. Add 1 tbsp of hot water first and gently whisk/mix together making sure no lumps remain. Add an addition tbsp of water, stir and set aside. Add oats, chia, milk and cream to a sauce pan and bring to a low simmer. Allow to cook and thicken while stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes. Remove oats from heat and add in matcha mixture to oats and fold into oats until matcha is fully incorporated. Serve topped with fruit. This is an extra step, but these oats to me were worth the extra care this morning. 🍵 Topped today with blueberries, blackberries, buckwheat, pepitas and hemp hearts. 💚
user_30;user_30191.jpg;It’s been a while since I attempted curry. 🍛This creamy chickpea red lentil curry did not disappoint at all! My favorite thing to add to stews and curries are red lentils. They are a favorite for the following reasons: . ✔️Iron packed ✔️ All the yummy plant based protein ✔️ Great for helping to thicken stews ✔️ so hearty and satisfying . Chickpea Red Lentil Curry 1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup red lentils 1/2 medium onion 1 cup crushed tomatoes 1 inch minced ginger 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 small sweet potato, cubed 2 tsp Garam Masala 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp mustard seeds 1/2 tsp turmeric 4 cardamom pods (press down lightly to crack the shell a little before throwing them in) 1 tsp cumin 2 bay leaves 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth . In a medium pot add onion and sauté until translucent. Add garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add in red pepper, Garam Masala, cinnamon, mustard seeds, cumin, turmeric and cardamom pods. Sauté for about 2 minutes. Feel free to add a splash of veggie broth if you notice a lot of sticking. Add tomatoes, sweet potato, chickpeas and lentils and stir to combine well. Add in vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat back down to a simmer and cover with a lid. Allow mixture to cook for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure that nothing is sticking. Remove cardamom pods and bay leaf. To make creamy, use an immersion blender OR take a portion of the mixture and add to a blender to blend until smooth then pour back into the pot. Mix well and serve. 🥣 . Served all of this with some @lotusfoods red rice and some sautéed broccoli. 🥦
user_30;user_30192.jpg;Was super inspired for some peaches in my oats thanks to @tumblinbumblincrumblincookie. I braved the cold yesterday to grab a fresh peach and just baked it this morning in the oven with a little cinnamon, cardamom, pinch of salt and date syrup. Baked at 350F until they were soft and omg so yum in my oatmeal. Baking fruit like this that isn’t super seeet is helpful for bringing out more of the fruits sweetness. Added some extra toppings like blueberries, pepitas, hemp hearts, cacao nibs, and walnuts. Bowls like this are always the most satisfying, nice warm and gooey. 🍑 . Cardamom Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp cardamom Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened soy milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow oats to cook and thicken while stirring, about 5 minutes. Serve with the warm peaches overtop. Thank you Lin! 👏🏽
user_30;user_30193.jpg;This stir-fry was one of the best experiences. 👏🏽Simple and so flavorful, but has a few tricks hidden inside. 😏 Here are some fun things you’ll find in this bowl to help elevate flavor: . ➕Fresh ginger to give it that classic stir-fry flavor. Don’t use powdered ginger for this. Can’t recommend enough. Plus you get the bonus of its anti-inflammatory benefits. . ➕Some raisins. I know that sounds odd, but it add just the right subtle sweetness to balance the savory saltiness in this dish. . ➕Tahini. Greg always jokes that I’m tahini girl, but it makes this stir-fry glossy and offers the most amazing balance and taste. . ➕Lemon zest for a little pop of brightness. Optional, but it was so nice. . Ginger Tahini Stir-Fry 1 cup broccoli florets 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms 1/4 onion, diced 1/2 cup thawed edamame 2 tsp soy sauce 1 inch fresh ginger minced 2-3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tsp garlic chili sauce 1 tbsp raisins 1 tbsp tahini Zest of half a lemon 2 tbsp water . In a pan start by cooking down the mushrooms and onions until softened on medium heat. Add in broccoli plus 2 tbsp water, cover pan with a lid and allow to steam for 3-4 minutes until florets are a bright green. Remove lid and add garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce, garlic chili sauce, raisins and tahini. Stir to combine and cook off any remaining liquids in the pan. Remove from heat and stir in edamame. Finish with the lemon zest and serve as desired. I paired my bowl with some quinoa and garnished with spring onions and red pepper flakes. 😌 Tahini used in this is by @soomfoods just in case you’re curious.
user_30;user_30194.jpg;Are you a kiwi fan? 🥝 Just a PSA because this inevitably comes up whenever I feature kiwi. Yes, you can eat the skin. No, you do not have to. But, if you do there are a ton of added benefits. . ✔️ You triple the amount of fiber you get in by leaving the skin on compared to just eating the flesh ✔️Higher levels of Vitamin C content ✔️Provides folate and more vitamin E than eating the flesh alone ✔️ 30% of the phenolics in kiwis are found in the skin (powerful antioxidants that help boost immunity and protect us) . Date Sweetened Oats 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1 medjool date, pitted and diced 1 cup unsweetened soy milk Pinch of salt . Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Allow oats to cook while stirring for about 5 minutes. When done, pour into your bowl and enjoy topped with fruits and seeds. I went with kiwi, blueberries, blackberries, cacao nibs, hemp hearts, and pepitas. 💚
user_30;user_30195.jpg;Had the most delicious salad tonight. 🥒Literally had all the flavors I wanted and was the perfect balance of textures too. I like to include everything satisfying in my salads, so for me that includes lots of fiber, some good starch, plant based protein, some healthy fats and some fun seasonings. Just promise me that your salads are fun for you and make you happy. 🥗 . ▪️RAW VEGGIES: Mixed greens. My green mix did include some spinach and baby kale. Also threw in some sliced cucumber. . ▪️STARCH: One giant sweet plantain, sliced into coins and baked in the oven at 400F for 15-20mins. Squeeze of lime and touch of salt. . ▪️COOKED VEGGIES: Some sautéed broccoli and mushrooms. Didn’t do much to them, just added a little soy sauce and cooked with a splash of water to soften the broccoli. . ▪️FRUIT: I love adding fruit to my salad especially fruit that is juicy. Kind of acts like a second dressing. Today I just used some blackberries. . ▪️PLANT PROTEIN: Some white beans seasoned with chili lime seasoning and a splash of soy sauce. I added it to my air fried for a few minutes to crisp up. . ▪️HEALTHY FAT: Super basic, but literally mixed a spoonful of tahini, juice of half a small lemon and a splash of water to thin it out. . ▪️FLAVOR: I used chili lime seasoning through out and added some extra flavor with the spring onions. . Have a lovely evening guys! 🍋
user_30;user_30196.jpg;Good morning! ☀️Thought it might be worth talking about the anatomy of a bowl. 🥣 If you’ve eaten breakfast or any meal for that matter and felt you could eat more, there is a good chance the bowl you consumed is likely not nourishing you the right way. Nourishment can be thought of in the terms of energy, being mentally content with what you consumed, and your mental awareness of your meal. Let’s break it down: . 1️⃣ ENERGY. What’s actually in your bowl? Do you think an instant oatmeal packet for example will sustain you a few hours? See how your body feels with the food you consumed. Ask yourself if you’re good or need to add more. Some people might feel sustained with that packet of oatmeal by itself while others need more rolled oats, some fiber from fresh fruit, some protein from something like soy milk, and/or some healthy fats. . 2️⃣ MENTALLY NOURISHED. If your food is making you feel bad mentally in any form or fashion, it might be time to move on to something else. It’s important to feel good about the food that’s fueling your day. If you feel low energy and crumby after a super sweet treat in the morning compare it to how you feel when you choose foods that sustain you for a longer period of time. It can also be learning more about yourself and learning what foods make you feel your absolute best. . 3️⃣ MINDFULNESS. Do you take time with your food? Not all of us have the privilege to take time with our meals and eat with intention or without distractions. But if there are some small things you can do to insert some balance with your time, definitely take advantage of it. It can be taking a bite and slowly chewing it at least once during a meal, taking five minutes to enjoy the first or last bit of your meal, or even putting your fork down in between bites. I often will have some of my clients work on just looking at their food and appreciate it for what it is. At the end of the day, we can all do the best we can. . Do note that there are circumstances that may make it difficult to participate in some of these actions. They can range from financial difficulty, anxiety, stress, time constraints and much more. [[continued below]]
user_30;user_30197.jpg;Made some mung beans earlier today. 🥣 I don’t have this bean too often as it is hard to find by me. But on a stroke of luck I found these mung beans on clearance at the grocery store. So I bought all the bags they had. 😂 Just cooked 1 cup in 3 cups veggie broth with a little adobo seasoning. While that cooked I baked some plantains and sautéed some kale and mushrooms in some soy sauce and garlic powder. 🥬Threw it all on a plate with some fresh cucumber slices and red pepper flakes, and that was my delicious lunch for the day. I batch cooked a bunch of the beans and veggies for the week for some easy mix and mash along with some grains and a stew. Looking forward to all the yummy eats this week. 😌 . Just in case, if you need a plantain tutorial, you can find my tutorials for both cooking with the sweet yellow plantains and the starchier green plantains in my highlights located on my profile. 👏🏽
user_30;user_30198.jpg;Happy Monday! 💜 A reminder to myself and maybe you as well to be gentle with yourself. Not everything you do is going to come effortlessly to you. There are things that will probably make you uncomfortable because you aren’t used to change yet, but keep working on your goals and know that this is all a process. ❤️Good vibes to you all as well as all the progress you might be looking for. ☀️ . Coconut Ginger Oatmeal 1/3 cup rolled oats 1 tsp chia seeds 1 tbsp coconut flakes 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground ginger Pinch of cardamom Pinch of salt 1 cup unsweetened almond milk . Add all ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Stir and allow to cook and thicken for about 5 minutes or as desired. Once done cooking, pour into a serving bowl and top as desired. 🥣 . My bowl this morning includes blueberries, golden berries, banana slices, pepitas, cacao nibs, and hemp hearts. 👏🏽
user_30;user_30199.jpg;Noodles, cauliflower bites, and baked tofu. For me, the true winner tonight. 🙌🏽 Used the same batter for the tofu that I used on the cauliflower and it was perfect. 👏🏽 If you want the recipe for these gochujang cauliflower bites you can find them on my blog linked to my profile or down below. Double the sauce and preferred bread crumbs if you want to do your tofu the same. Noodles I used were the vegan yakisoba noodles from @jslfoods. 🍜 .  Gochujang Spiced Cauliflower Bites 2 tsp gochujang (or sriracha) 2 tbsp tahini (I used the brand @soomfoods) 2 tsp soy sauce or coconut aminos 2 tsp maple syrup 6 tbsp of water 2 cups raw cauliflower, cut into bite size pieces 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs or gluten free bread crumbs (Trader Joe’s has a rice one that’s awesome) . Preheat oven to 400F. Combine all ingredients except cauliflower and bread crumbs in a medium bowl. Mix and you should get a slightly thickened sauce. Add in your cauliflower pieces and toss to coat in your sauce. As you coat, sprinkle bread crumbs over top and toss to evenly distribute over cauliflower pieces. Once all pieces are coated, add cauliflower pieces to lined baking sheet and place in the oven for 20 minutes or until you see pieces become golden on top. Using a fork, carefully flip cauliflower pieces and then bake tray again for 10-15 minutes until you see them get crispy on the ends. Remove from oven and allow to cook for 5 minutes before serving. 🥣 Note: if you cannot handle gluten, feel free to utilize gluten free ramen noodles as a yummy alternative. 🙂
