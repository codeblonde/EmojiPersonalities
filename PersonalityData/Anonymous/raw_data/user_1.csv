user_1;user_10.jpg;i believe that you are beautiful. i believe that you are perfect. i believe that you are worthy of being spellbound by your own divinity. i believe that you are deserving of remembering that you are god in disguise. i believe that it is your birthright to always feel safe in your skin. i believe that you are so brave. to be human. to be alive. to come to earth, and experience the temporary amnesia that caused you to abandon your wings. to experience the suffering of separation that caused you to forget that you are a living extension source itself, awakening to its own divinity through this fragile human life. so i want to say thank you. thank you for your bravery. thank you for your courage. thank you for the gift of your presence upon this planet. thank you for doing the best you can. thank you for picking yourself back up again, through the pain, through the heartbreak, through the emptiness. through the heaviness you thought would shatter you. it has all guided you here. it has all prepared you for your purpose. which is simply to remember that nothing could, or ever will break the source of heavenly love woven through every inch of your existence. the real you, the eternal you, is untouchable. stir your awareness gently from its slumber. softly reawaken the angelic nature of your being. let self forgiveness become your salvation as you rise in the remembrance that you were always free. your flight will remind others to unfold their wings. i believe that this is how we guide each other back home....by seeing ourselves through the eyes of divinity. and remembering that self love is our natural state of being.
user_1;user_11.jpg;i’ve been savoring moments of self intimacy lately. becoming my own source of medicine. just doing little things to offer myself kindness throughout the day. massaging my skin. making my bed. blessing my food. wearing cute clothes even if i’m staying home all day. playing moody music that makes me want to sing at the top of my lungs. being unapologetically honest even if it feels scary. writing poems just because. releasing lots of tears. speaking to my angels out loud. knowing they are hearing every word. sweating every single morning. feeling stronger every day. mentally and physically. listening to the unspoken whispers arising from the depths of my womb. trusting my instincts. worshipping my body. nurturing my worth. feeling. crying. praying. dancing. resting. being. drinking divinity into the depths of my bones. letting love saturate every crevice of my body until fear becomes a long forgotten memory. i moved into a new home a few days ago and i feel like i can fully rest in my own frequency here. gratitude has become my constant state of being. i’ve been breathing deeper. moving slower. with each inhale, i swear i can feel every internal barrier i’ve built between myself and love gently dissolving. piece by piece. brick by brick. my heart is melting open like a flower unfolding its petals to taste the familiar warmth of a rising sun. i feel like the more i slow down, and be more, and try less, the more magnetic my field becomes to the miracles that support the fulfillment of my mission. i believe the silence has a language of its own for those who have the courage to gaze beneath the chaos. i believe our souls speak to us through stillness. i believe that the entire universe is just waiting for you to stop for a moment...and listen. can you hear the sound of your dreams begging you to surrender just a little deeper? if you let go, i promise love will never leave you. it is all you ever were.
user_1;user_12.jpg;if i change, it’s okay. if i evolve, it’s okay. if i grow, it’s okay. it’s okay to lose touch with who i used to be. i bow to every past version of myself, for carrying me here. i forgive myself for every moment of self betrayal, because i know that sometimes i had to stumble backwards into patterns of pain to see the cycles that need to be broken. even in the darkness, i am rising. even in the emptiness, i am full. it is safe for me to make mistakes. it is safe for me to be imperfect. it is safe for me to be myself. i am proud of who i am. i love who i am becoming. my sensitivity is sacred. i love how deeply i feel. i love my smile, and my tears. i am the witness of these emotional waves, i surrender to their sacred currents of release. i treat myself the way i want to be treated. i rest in the refuge of my divinity. i am at peace in my skin. every breath i take is a prayer of gratitude for this human body. i gaze upon every inch of my being through the eyes of my higher self, who always recognizes how worthy i am of feeling beautiful and free. i trust the gentle whispers of my inner child. my mind is a temple of tender thoughts. i lean in to the wisdom of my instincts. my connection to source is unbreakable. i am nurtured by the unconditional love of mother gaia. i embody her resilience effortlessly. i am eternally enveloped by the embrace of my ancestors, angels, and guides. i am infinitely protected. i have a purpose for being here. the miracles that support my mission are magnetized to me. my life is holy. i am always enough. self love is my natural state of being. inner peace is my birthright. i believe in the power of my dreams. i allow the heaven of my heart to be fully anchored on planet earth, for the benefit of all living creatures everywhere. i am worthy of a beautiful life. i am a being of light. i am whole. i am free.

user_1;user_18.jpg;now she’s back in the atmosphere with drops of jupiter in her hair
user_1;user_19.jpg;my soul silently dreams of a softer world. a planet of pure peace, where every human being remembers to believe in magic again. where tenderness flows freely. where every single drop of water is seen as sacred. a heavenly planet that worships the effortlessly selfless nature of mother earth. a realm where women witness the divine beauty of other women as a reflection of their own. a sanctuary where the illusion of separation becomes a distant memory and we laugh back to the times when fear stole the laughter from our lungs and we placed our self worth upon external accomplishments. a refuge where emotions feel safe to be fully expressed. where vulnerability is perceived as the highest source of strength...and i can feel this place being birthed through each of us here and now. the leaves and trees weave whispers of redemption within my mind. reminding me to breathe. that everything will be fine. one day waves of forgiveness and warmth will flood the cells of all beings and envelope us in an ocean of unwavering trust that transcends the edges of our own minds. and until that day comes, keep going. keep rising. keep loving. the unknown is begging to become your home. sometimes we can only find ourselves in places where everything seems to be lost. look beneath the surface. fear always fades in time. and love only rises. keep hope alive.
user_1;user_110.jpg;concept: your purpose is whatever makes you genuinely feel the most alive and at peace and connected to your inner child in this moment. this is what will heal our planet. and it can look like anything. and it is constantly shifting. release the societal pressure that you need to be constantly working or grinding or achieving to have a beautiful impact within this world. your life is enough. you simply existing in a receptive, surrendered state of being to receive the frequency your soul and allow that to carry you is your purpose. this can take many forms. i believe that our inner light shines the brightest when we are truly, genuinely happy. so do whatever that looks like for you today. we can only nurture and heal this world by loving and listening to our inner realm first. lately i’ve felt the most alive when i rest in mother nature and listen to her whispers. so maybe this is my purpose right now. to be.

user_1;user_113.jpg;i’ve always felt most at home in places untouched by human hands. where i can hear the sound of my own breath as my thoughts dissolve into the earth beneath my bare skin. in her selfless creation, i see the purest form of myself. a creature who is free. innocent. and whole. a living source of feminine strength, whose ability to self heal transcends any force that threatens to darken her inner light. a goddess spellbound by her own divinity, eternally devoted to the path of her childhood dreams. the stillness whispers secrets through the wind, carrying the rhythm of ancient lullabies birthed beyond the boundaries of time. the river reveals the beauty of surrender as she paints her way effortlessly through this untamed forest. the trees cradle the warmth of the sun in their branches as they stretch higher towards the heavens. nothing is forced. nothing is rushed. and it is here, i remember. how to be human. how to love. how to fall. how to rise. nature reminds us that there is no where to go. nothing to do. no one to be. this existence is enough. 🌿 thank you @imiloainstitute for the jungle refuge during my journey in costa rica. your sanctuary is sacred beyond words. i couldn’t have asked for a more nurturing space to stay. i am forever grateful and cannot wait to return soon.
user_1;user_114.jpg;beneath the surface, you are always free. eternally beautiful. innocent. and wild. thank you @envisionfestival for reminding me of this. i’ve honestly been struggling to put my experience here into words. i feel more myself than i have in months...like every cell in my body is coming alive again as i learn to fall deeper and further in love with who i am becoming with each breath i take. being surrounded by open minded humans in the middle of a jungle dancing and listening to some of the most powerful artists for a week straight was pure medicine. my soul has been kissed by the sweet warmth of surrender. i finally feel at peace with the complete uncertainty of my reality at this time...not knowing where i’m going next, what i’m doing. there is so much relief and expansion to be found in releasing control and just letting life carry you in her wings for a while. i honestly don’t know what will happen next, but i know it will be beautiful. thank you to this sacred land, costa rica, for kissing my heart in sweet remembrance and light. i love you.
user_1;user_115.jpg;i haven’t had any phone service for the last few weeks here in costa rica which has been such a blessing in disguise. slowing down is so sacred. stillness is the ultimate cure. i didn’t even realize how fast my mind has been moving until i touched down here. i feel like i’m coming home to myself again. my breath has been deeper. my thoughts have been gentler. the world is softening and relaxing around me. life is so tender and sweet. i don’t have too many words right now. and maybe that’s a beautiful thing. when you are so overwhelmed with gratitude you don’t even know what else to say. sometimes “thank you” is enough.
user_1;user_116.jpg;breathe stillness into the depths of your body. slow down. listen. rest. take care of your invisible self. let your skin become a safe space for your soul to linger. find freedom in the inevitable solitude of this existence. there are no others. there is truly, only, just you. even the people surrounding you are only a living reflection of your inner realm. so may as well make it beautiful. uproot the weeds growing within your mind. paint your insides with the colors of your childhood dreams and watch as they gently come to life in your outer world. remember that it’s okay to pause sometimes. slowing down doesn’t mean you are going backwards. if anything...it is giving you the fuel necessary to go further than your mind can even fathom. remember that source supports you to the depth at which you are willing to surrender. so let go. and become lighter and lighter until you become light itself. this life is so sacred. please don’t take a single moment for granted. every choice you make is bringing you closer or further from your highest self. so before making any decision, ask yourself if your future self will thank you for choosing this. then act accordingly. take the higher path. it’s more difficult but more rewarding. keep hope alive and raise your eyes higher. don’t lower your vision for the ones who are afraid of heights.
user_1;user_117.jpg;maybe one day, you will choose to remember. your power. your divinity. your light. it won’t be easy. but it will be worth it. and as you heal your wounds...as you shed your skin...piece by piece....breath by breath...you may feel like you’re stumbling backwards as your reality of blinded comfort crumbles to pieces around you. i know that rebuilding yourself from the inside out is messy. it’s painful and confronting and so incredibly lonely at times. you’ll probably find yourself spiraling into past patterns of pain, only to recognize the fact that you were suffering in that self created situation in the first place. the moment you choose to take back control of your life, the moment you choose pick up your paintbrush and paint with the colors you like, instead of the colors given to you, a veil will lift. and no longer blinded by the illusion of victimization, your eyes will open. completely. and this can be terrifying at first. there will be things you don’t want to look at. things you don’t want to see through. things you don’t want to feel. you may feel scared. scared to taste the freedom begging you to unravel just a few more layers. scared to let go. scared to feel the pain is your aching heart is screaming to release. and as you tremble upon the edges of insanity and uncertainty, looking back at the world behind you, fighting against every urge to run into the familiar numbness of the past, a tiny voice will ask you to be still for a moment. to breathe. to be. this voice is so quiet that very few hear this gentle whisper above the chaos consuming their mind. but if you are lucky enough to hear this sound, listen. and forgive. forgive yourself for not knowing better. forgive yourself for doing the best that you could. forgive forgive forgive. let forgiveness become the source of fuel that carries you into the arms of freedom. i promise that the light won’t blind you. it will only open you to experience the sheer depths and unimaginable beauty of this human experience that is your birthright. please don’t fade away into the fears of the past. please don’t close your eyes again. please don’t go back to sleep. now is all that is.
user_1;user_118.jpg;i’ve called this land down under home for the last three months. and today, i left this nest to explore the world beyond this beautiful womb that has held me through some of the most intense cycles of death and rebirth i’ve ever experienced. so this post is a thank you. to this sacred land. to all indigenous tribes and ancestors who have woven their wisdom into the roots of the earth here. to every tear that spilled from heavy eyes that grew exhausted from holding everything inside. to the screams and the silence. to every whisper and secret spoken beneath a blanket of indigo colored stars. to the memories lived just outside the boundaries of time. to this unapologetically unpredictable existence. to the moments of pain so raw, so unmistakably human, they demanded to be felt. to be released as rivers that cascaded from my aching heart, watering the seeds of my dreams as they found their way to freedom. to every stranger i’ve met that became family to me in a matter of seconds. to all of my yummy plants i ate that brought my belly comfort and warmth. to the unspoken moments that stole the very breath from my lungs with their otherworldly beauty. to the laughter that spilled from my lips as my inner child stirred from her slumber. to the rain that poured from the sky when the whole world prayed for the fires. to my reawakened faith in miracles. thank you australia. for teaching me how to be kinder and softer to myself and to others. thank you for humbling me and bringing me back home to myself. thank you for showing me that just like the trees and the ocean and the moon, i am still growing. i am still learning. and i always will be. growth is forever. there’s no beginning or end.
user_1;user_119.jpg;illumination spilled from the lavender colored clouds cradling the heavens above me, painting my mind in the whispers of my wildest dreams. my thoughts softened as the roots of faith reached deep beneath the surface of my skin, unravelling the unspoken fears that had been eating away at my soul for far too long. i swayed beneath the trees stretching out their branches to drink in the afternoon sunlight, and felt freedom filling my lungs for what felt like the first time. i realized that the trees never worry if they will grow fast enough...so why was i rushing my own rising? unapologetically alive with the reawakened curiosity of my inner child, i could finally see this world through eyes unclouded by fear. and piece by piece, the beautifully broken reality i lived within began to heal. the more i loved myself, the more life seemed to love me back. i can feel an unspoken source of power rising up within me. a gentle power. a sensitive kind of strength. surrender is softening me. the unknown has become my guardian angel. i’ll rest in her arms for now. 📷: @the_nel_family
user_1;user_120.jpg;an empty mind painted in unspoken dreams. the taste of your lips and lavender colored sunsets. the beautifully wild unknown. saltwater skin. sandy sheets. sex that carries you to worlds beyond worlds. swimming naked. honestly just being naked, in general. on all levels. emotionally and physically. the sound of a voice stripped down with honesty. delicate tattoos. the smell of earth after it rains. humans who reawaken your inner child. overgrown backyard gardens. fresh baked banana bread. people you can be completely comfortable in silence with. home cooked meals that fill your belly with unconditional warmth. ice cold showers first thing in the morning. affectionate cats. bonfires on secluded beaches. women who genuinely want to see other women rise. star gazing beneath cozy blankets. strangers that smile back at you. beyonce. chai tea with a tiny splash of oat milk. singing. photography so raw you feel like you were there when you see the image. komorebi. sunlight pouring through the leaves of the trees. plant medicine. a perfectly ripened avocado. house plants. our ability to self heal through the remembrance of how perfect we truly are on the inside. the ancient wisdom lingering in the eyes of little kids. days spent doing nothing. deep conversations. random acts of kindness that restore your hope in human beings. my soul family in australia. the stillness and strength of the indigo ocean. the present moment portal. making music. steaming hot baths and creative flows that make you stay up all night. choosing faith over fear. how quickly the collective consciousness on this planet is expanding. the unwavering forgiveness of our mother earth. the kind of suffering that strengthens our compassion for others. shedding your skin. unravelling. crying. (seriously...how amazing is crying? i cry a few times a week at least. it’s always such a healing release and i feel so much lighter when i just let it flow thru.) letting go. surrender. change. freedom. growth. rebirth. new beginnings. these are a few of my favorite things. comment yours below. xx 📷: @the_nel_family
user_1;user_121.jpg;i forgive every past version of myself, for she carried me here. i forgive her for every single moment she stumbled into darkness, blinded by the pain of self sabotage. i forgive her for numbing my sensitive nature with distractions, for looking for love in empty places that only pulled her further from her soul. i forgive her for ignoring the gentle whisper of her intuition, crying out to be heard above the noise inside her mind. i love and forgive her, because each trembling step she took forward, guided me here. even when her body was aching with the agony of self neglect, even when her soul was bruised by the weight of shame hanging over her, she continued to walk forward into the depths of the wild unknown. no matter how broken or messy, i will choose to heal all parts of my being through unconditional self acceptance. i will make peace with my past, for everything is accessed in the now. forgiveness is the womb of inner unity. there are no mistakes here. only lessons that strengthen your soul. she is rising. 📷: @the_nel_family
user_1;user_122.jpg;hey fam!! 🙈 i have millions of happy butterflies in my belly writing these words because i’ve been waiting such a long while to share this with you. and today, the moment has finally come to spill this secret. this july, i’ll be hosting my next retreat in ibiza with @clariness.co! sorry guys, this one is just for us girls! 💕 the focus of this retreat is to strengthen your inner source of self love through sisterhood. as women, we have been conditioned to be bound by the illusion of comparison for far too long. i was actually severely bullied by girls growing up, and i know from personal experience how agonizing this feels. it is only in the last few years that i have attracted human beings into my life who genuinely want to see me shine. and i feel like this has only happened because i chose to love myself, first. real, honest connections and self love go hand in hand. when we choose to come back home to ourselves, and learn to hold even our wounds in unconditional acceptance, this inner state of compassion and love cannot help but be reflected externally. so this is my hope for this retreat. that throughout our journey together, you can begin to love yourself (even just a tiny bit more), and through this love, create lifelong connections with human beings who are devoted to supporting you maintain your inner peace. the path back to your soul is a courageous one to walk upon. it can feel so lonely at times, which is why I am so deeply called to host these retreats. to simply remind you that you are not alone. no one is immune to being human. and there is so much strength and beauty in our scars. but sometimes we can only fully glimpse this inner beauty through the reflection of others who surround us. if you feel called to join me...the link is in my bio with all the details. so much love.
user_1;user_123.jpg;thank you for your love. i wish i could respond to every single one of your beautiful, honest, gentle messages on my last post but i thought this is a better way to reach all of you at once. it definitely wasn’t the easiest thing to share...but i feel like i’m reaching a point in my life where all i can do is be fully transparent with myself and others. i don’t have the energy for anything less than pure vulnerability in every aspect of my life. i feel your support through this transition so deeply. i feel so held in genuine understanding and empathy by each of you. thank you. i hope that you can see pieces of yourself in my journey, and know that whatever you are going through right now, you are so not alone. whenever i’m experiencing a moment of darkness so raw and deep it demands to be felt...to be cried, to be released...i just remember that even this is temporary. and that this is teaching me the lessons i require for the next stage of my journey. as far as how i’m feeling...i honestly feel deeply exhausted. on all levels. mental. emotional. physical. i feel like i can’t sleep enough. almost like every single cell in my body is begging me to slow down and just breathe and do nothing for a while. like i’m being fully reset for this next chapter. i feel like my soul evolves so quickly but it takes my human self a little longer to adjust to the sudden shifts and changes. the exhaustion i feel isn’t negative, it’s more of a complete release into surrender. like reuniting with my soul and just melting into her familiar embrace. letting her cleanse me in waves of comforting emptiness. i’ve never felt so at peace and so free yet so uncertain all at once. it’s a beautiful space to be in. i’m learning to make the unknown my home right now. thank you for being here through the highs and the lows and the in betweens. i love you all.
user_1;user_124.jpg;i feel like i am finally ready to share this. and i hope that these vulnerable words are received with open minds and hearts by all who read this post. i am currently in the process of rediscovering who i am after parting ways with a truly incredible human being. it’s been one of the most intense shifts of my entire life but i feel in every cell of my body that this is the right decision for me at this time. my intuition has never guided me astray. and i am in the process of learning to put that inner voice first, over everything else. right now, i am learning to make the unknown my home. i am learning trust. i am learning surrender. i am learning freedom. i am learning faith. i am learning to lean into the uncertainty of fully repainting my life from scratch on a blank canvas. some days feel heavier in my mind than others. but my heart feels lighter than she has in a while...so i’m grateful for that. i want each of you to know that when people part ways, romantic or not...its not necessary because one person is bad or good, or someone is right or wrong, or someone messed up...it’s usually just because you are no longer serving each other’s evolution at this point in time. i really feel like it is that simple. there is no need to overcomplicate things. the mind will always attempt to do that. listen to your heart instead. ricky, you truly grounded me and held space for me to find true self love within my own being. the last year we spent together was one of the wildest, most beautiful adventures of my entire life...and i don’t regret a single moment in your presence. we both taught each other so much, and will continue to throughout this entire human experience. the love we have for each other hasn’t gone away, it has only shifted form. thank you for everything, ricky. you changed my life forever.
user_1;user_125.jpg;what does listen make you feel? close your eyes and spill your soul below...i love you all so much. thank you for being here. this is only the beginning. anchoring in the intention to make 2020 my most creative year yet. remembering that every ounce of love, of confusion, of pain, of uncertainty, every high and low and in between...is only strengthening my ability to tap into the emotional depths of self expression. remembering that everything is for the art. it is my hope that every single creation that pours through me reminds you that you are not alone. i am with you. forever.
user_1;user_126.jpg;l i s t e n is live. happy new year angels. honestly i was going to write a super long caption about how much this song means to my heart and soul...but i feel like it speaks for itself. it is the creation of three days spent in a self made music studio in our garage in hawaii earlier this year...literally recorded the vocals with a blanket over my head because we didn’t have noise cancelling walls. we had no plan, no expectation for this song. all we knew, is that we needed to make one. i really don’t even remember how this was created...our minds dissolved as we entered a complete flow state for three days. all sense of time, of self, of separation, dissolved as we offered our voices as vessels for the expression of source. thank you @vertigeux for breathing life into this dream with me. you are one of the most versatile and genuine artists i’ve ever met. and thank you @lucia.dami for creating the most beautiful cover art for listen. thank you to every single human being who brought this invisible art into physical form. you know who you are. i love you all beyond words and worlds. xx
user_1;user_127.jpg;in full transparency...the end of this year was pretty intense for me. on all levels. emotional. mental. physical. the closing of this cycle has stirred the wounds of my inner child in a way nothing has before, and all i can do is hold her in forgiveness as the rivers of buried emotion pour from my skin. i’ve felt so deeply exhausted these last few days that all i can do is breathe and rest. on new years eve i was literally in bed before midnight and spent the entire evening eating soup and journaling at home...but it’s what i needed. i feel like 2019 was my cocoon year. i became a little caterpillar and crawled into the center of my soul, curling into the depths of darkness lingering beyond the chaotic surface of our external world. it was a year of growing pains. of bone crushing lows and indescribably beautiful highs. i felt my energy being pulled inwards as self love became my medicine. i learned to heal through forgiveness. of myself, and others. most of my achievements in 2019 were internal. and i’m so okay with that. i feel like i’ve created an inner sanctuary that now protects me everywhere i go. if all you did this year was stay alive, that’s enough. don’t compare your path to others. you are exactly where you are meant to be. right here. right now. i currently feel like my wings are beginning to unfold. stretching me beyond these walls. pushing me further. deeper. higher. all at once. i can feel the womb that carried me all throughout last year slipping away, dissolving into the air around my body. i can feel my skin shedding. melting away the familiar layers that kept me safe when i needed nothing but stillness. but now, the time has come to fly again. and as i take flight, i feel the comfort collapsing beneath me. the unknown is begging to become my home. and all i can do is surrender to the infinite beautiful mystery of it all. i’ve never felt so deeply uncertain of everything yet so deeply at peace with this all at once. i know it is all for the art. i don’t create when i’m comfortable. it’s that simple. and in 2020...creativity is my top priority. so i know i called all of this in. my voice will no longer be silenced. she will be freed.
user_1;user_128.jpg;your pain doesnt need to be fought, it just needs to be loved love will bring you back to life the kind of unconditional love that only comes from within your own being that is your medicine this will heal you
user_1;user_129.jpg;i saw it in the way she gently embraced her hidden wounds in the tender up curves of her smile that never faded no matter who she was speaking to i saw it in the untamed storm that she released when she could no longer contain her fire in the beautiful mess she made of all the walls i had built up against love i saw in her a magic that i remembered dreaming up on tuesday afternoons, playing in the castle of my childhood room a magic i carried with me, in search of someone who could join my world of faeries and talking animals, coming together under grandmother willow trees to gossip about the wildness of their passing days of lions who were friends and fairies that taught me how to read. i saw the way she danced in her untamed world and i knew i was safe. for I had found another who’s heart was still free, despite all it had seen. -poem by @yaknowme_hitomi sent in a late night text hehe xx i love you
user_1;user_130.jpg;i spent nearly all of my life feeling like a complete stranger in my own skin. constantly comparing myself to other beautiful women, avoiding my own face in every mirror i passed by. feelings of insecurity eating me alive as i buried my body in beauty products, trying everything to be prettier, more attractive....buying clothes i thought were cool, starving myself, only to end up binging later on. the more external bandaids i attempted to patch up my internal wounds with, the further i fell from myself. it was an endless cycle of self sabotage that i’m finally rising out of through shifting out of by choosing to devote my energy to healing the invisible realms that compose my inner self. it’s honestly just within this last year that i can say that i genuinely love myself at a depth i never thought i’d access as a human being. and i feel like this love is glowing through me from within at the moment, (after going thru a massive shedding and rebirth this last month) which is why i am currently so passionate about expressing this body as a form of art through my photography. to feel your soul come home within your skin is one of the most beautiful emotions we can experience as human beings and i feel like right now i’m overflowing with so much appreciation of the journey i’ve been on with my body that i need to share it (or i’ll burst). not to make you feel separate from me, or to have you compare yourself, but to reflect to you what is possible within your own being. i hope that when you see my art, the love i have for myself becomes a catalyst for you to unearth this sacred source of intimacy within the roots of your own being. people wonder why i’m nude in nature all the time and this is because i feel most at peace when there is nothing separating my skin from mother earth. her raw, wild, bare self is beautiful and so are we. i have reached a point in my life where i’m kind of tired of explaining myself but i felt like i needed to share this to open a few minds to a new perspective. i believe that as women, when we embrace our sensuality for ourselves, we heal. i believe that nudity is natural. our perception of it isn’t.
user_1;user_131.jpg;bathed in the sweet nectar of golden honey light saltwater lullabies dripped into the mess of my mind painting her walls with the colors of stillness with the sound of freedom so i paused to taste what love feels like drinking in her warmth as she enveloped me in emptiness the kind that makes you become full
user_1;user_132.jpg;if only i could whisper to you the way the wind pulls the waves in her gentle orbit of surrender. if only i could warm your skin the way the sunlight kisses the leaves of the flowers as they bloom with each footstep you take. if only i could hold you the way the earth holds the roots of the trees as they weave their way beneath the surface of this world. what if my lips gave only kindness, the way the apple trees offered only apples. what if we remembered our innocence, and set our fears free. they would spiral deeper and deeper into the sky, dissolving softly into the sun. love would become the only truth we ever knew. wisdom cannot be found, it can only be freed. let go.
user_1;user_133.jpg;you are supported to the depth that you choose to surrender. let go of your plans and future expectations that only confine your beautifully broken wings. please be tender with yourself. take care of yourself. pray to mother earth, and she will envelope you in her mysterious dreams. trust your intuition. for she is never wrong. let the waves fill you with wonder, as they caress your skin in dolphin songs. every moment is sacred when your mind has the strength to stay empty. run away with me...as we spend our days doing absolutely nothing, yet everything. lost in a beautiful haze as we flutter from flower to flower. laughing like the little kids we are as we dance beneath the light flicking through the leaves of the trees resting above us. our souls are the anchors of eternal heaven on earth. the roots of the tree nourish the leaves...as above so below. breathe. 🕊  happy full moon ✨ this moment in our collective evolution is most likely bringing many unhealed wounds to the surface to be fully cleansed from your beautiful being. trust the process and find complete acceptance for e v e r y t h i n g that you are experiencing. we never lose our demons, we only learn to live above them. this too shall pass. let it flow. let it go. forever.
user_1;user_134.jpg;it’s easy to look out into this wild world and get swallowed into the stories that you should be doing more, achieving more, and being more. there’s this unspoken pressure to constantly “keep up” woven into the foundation of our crumbling society. i’m not sure what or who we are even keeping up with anymore or where this endless race is leading to...but i’d definitely prefer to get entirely lost in the wildflowers along the way. they whisper secrets to the minds that find the strength to stay silent in a world consumed by empty noise. i’ll answer questions with more questions as i nurture the untamed curiousity of my inner child. i’ll soar with the birds and shed my skin in shimmering saltwater pools as i dance through the ocean long after dusk, the cosmic sea reflected above me. little white freckles painted across the night sky. smiling at me from the inside. i’ll find peace in solitude. beauty in the emptiness. life in every death. home in the unknown. trusting the ever evolving elements of earth to teach me everything i’ve ever needed to know. that change is a symptom of growth. and growing is eternal. and i’m always, exactly where i need to be.you can find me in the in between moments. the moments that are raw and human and so deeply beautiful they steal the breath from your lungs. the moments when you feel so fully alive that any trace of division, of time, of fear, fades into a distant memory. the moments when everything suddenly just makes sense. like the gentle flicker of warmth in your chest when you are peeking over the edge of your inner walls...knowing that your wings will only appear, the second you hurl your limbs into the abyss below...and let go.
user_1;user_135.jpg;what is love, to you?  to me.... love is freedom. love is getting so deeply lost in the untamed imagination of your inner child that their dreams become the world you live within. love is the taste of air after lilac colored clouds have blanketed the earth in their tears. love is the warmth in your chest when you’re experiencing a moment so beautiful it doesn’t even feel remotely real. love is when someone looks into you without turning away...not just at you, on a surface level. love is messy. being vulnerable. being human. love is the rivers that pour from your eyes the day you grew too tired from holding it all inside, melting away your walls until all that remains is the fragile rhythm of a heart that has been broken millions of times but still continues to beat. love is your inner knowing that everything really is, going to be okay. even when it doesn’t feel like it. especially when it doesn’t feel like it. love is being held in the arms of your soul. the feeling of solitude that doesn’t feel lonely, for you can see yourself in all that surrounds you. love is emptiness overflowing. love is all that is. you are love. i am love. we are one. forever.
user_1;user_136.jpg;dear 11 year old claire, there are some things i want to tell you. 1. if you wait until you’re ready, you’ll always be waiting. 2. your dreams have the power to guide you to freedom. i know you feel a bit lost right now, but you will carve your own path. it won’t be easy. but it will be worth it. your life is worth more than the fulfillment of external expectations others have placed upon you. 3. trust your intuition. she is never wrong. literally. 4. the voice of your soul is fluent in the language of stillness. when your mind is empty, you will hear her whispers echoing through your inner abyss. 5. solitude is medicine. 6. waking up before sunrise is severely underrated. drink in the colors of dawn more often. 7. tell your parents you love them. they did the best they could, giving their own conditioning and wounds. and hey, you turned out ok. 8. forgiveness will free you. forgive yourself for all moments of self sabotage and neglect. forgive those who have hurt you, intentionally or not. 9. everyone is fighting an inner battle few know about...so always be kind. especially to those who aren’t kind to you. 10. crying is okay. being human is okay. your deeply emotional nature is a gift. sensitivity is a source of strength that connects you to all living beings. stay gentle. 11. the breakdown always comes before the breakthrough. 12. perfection will paralyze self expression. 13. your ski jump nose is perfect. and one day you will love how tall you are. you are so much more than your looks. when you see this...your physical form will shift to match your inner world. gaze into your soul more often, instead of a mirror. 14. plant wildflowers in your mind. your body listens to everything you think. make yourself your own home. 15. surround yourself with humans who make you feel like a little kid and lose track of time. these are your people. 16. fall in love with yourself, first. 17. life can shift completely at any moment. change is our only constant. evolve fluidly...trust that source is smarter than you are. 18. art will save you. 19. everything is gonna be ok. i promise. love, your 21 year old self. life only gets better from here.
user_1;user_137.jpg;for me, stillness is a sacred source of self love. when i give my mind the freedom to become completely blank, i sink fully into the beauty of this moment. i can listen to the gentle colors of the earth as they melt into my skin. i can hear the whisper of my inner being, calling me home. and with eyes unclouded by the chains of the past, and a future that will never come, i can see that nothing exists but now. this breath. this second. and in the emptiness, i become whole....overflowing with self acceptance, i can finally fill others without depleting myself. another form of self care i love is plant medicine from mama earth. nothing has healed my body, soul, and mind more than spending time in nature and indulging in the magic she so selflessly gives us. as you most likely know already, i’ve been taking syncromystic medicines consistently for the last few months and they have truly strengthened my inner journey of self love beyond words. my friend finn makes all of his products in hawaii with the purest of intention, and today i am teaming up with him to share some of the love with you! we’ve decided to send 11 of you the white rose dha + himalayn shilajit + focus cbd blend (my three favorite products)  to enter the giveaway: 🦋 follow @user_1 + @syncromystic + @fractalforestkauai 🦋 comment your current favorite form of self love, or share something that has deeply inspired you recently... 🦋 tag 3 or more friends!  there are no limits for how many times you can enter 🦋 the winners will be announced on the 25th of this month. soo much love!! xx  GIVEAWAY CLOSED. ✨✨✨ thank you to everyone who entered! 🕊
user_1;user_138.jpg;have you ever felt achingly deep nostalgia for a moment in the present? almost like you are watching life unfold through the ancient eyes of your future self...knowing that one day you’ll laugh and smile when all the pieces of your scattered memories come together. as you empty your mind, your soul becomes full...and your heart can finally make sense of the eternal mystery of our ever evolving existence. the limits of your head will never be able to fully comprehend the totality of this infinite universe. so don’t try to have it all figured out right now...you never will. surrender and just be. (easier said than done obviously. but spending time in nature helps. movement is medicine. listen to the sound of your breath. immerse your life in genuine humans. ocean waves. good food. good music. good nights. you are so loved. never forget it. keep rising.) 🕊 xx
user_1;user_139.jpg;let me remember the taste of youth the smell of summer and lilac perfume bittersweet bliss and saltwater tears sipping on dreams as love whispers near
user_1;user_140.jpg;something that has been coming to me super strong lately is just how crucial and necessary space is. to breathe. to be. to crumble. so that we can rise in wholeness. i grew up as an only child, and i always felt a little out of place with the people around me in childhood. because of this, my untamed imagination ran wild. i created make believe worlds with lilac colored dinosaur friends and angels who never left my side. recently i’ve felt my inner child crying out again for the silence that envelopes an empty mind...she is gently reminding me that solitude is a healing source of medicine. and change is a catalyst of freedom if you find the courage to surrender to the shifts that carve your path. you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. and you probably never will. so as you blindly stumble forward through this endlessly vast ocean of uncertainty, please know that in this moment, you are exactly where you are meant to be. surrender. let your mind melt into the natural ebb and flow of this ever evolving human existence...and you will unearth a deeper sense of self trust than you have ever known. our consciousness arises from a realm of infinite potential...so of course following your intuition doesn’t make logical sense to the limits of your human self most of the time. trust anyways. leap anyways. sometimes we don’t realize we have wings until we are falling...let them unfold.
user_1;user_141.jpg;children of the stars you have travelled so far to remember who you are illumination in human form divinity seeking refuge in the beauty of your own existence for a little while let any lingering trace of fear fade into the stillness woven through an empty mind let love guide you nurture you protect you may you remember that you are eternally free from all illusion that seeks to starve your soul you are love in its purest form return
user_1;user_142.jpg;you are here to understand yourself. not to be understood. learn to evolve without apologizing. change is a symptom of growth. nurture your natural process over the fulfillment of external expectations. you shed your skin so beautifully...continue to unravel your soul.
user_1;user_143.jpg;i love you. i love you the way a little girl has a crush on the boy sitting in front of her in a class so boring all she can do during it is fantasize about a fairytale wedding with a kid she’s never talked to. i love you the way a plant loves the rain and i love you the way an old couple can speak without saying a single word. i love you i love you i love you. i love that you don’t see me as who you want me to be, you see me for who i actually am. and you love me for all that i am. human and imperfect and crazy and beautiful. your love has helped me to love myself more. which is all i could ever ask for. life is like a living painting with you. sometimes i paint all over you in blue and make your shoulders wet with my saltwater tears as i cry out the stories that are no longer mine to carry. sometimes its sunlight kisses and sweet wine so delicious it makes my heart ache. it’s light and dark and messy and everything in between. thank you for being so kind and patient and gentle with my heart as she unfolds. thank you for believing in my strength. thanks for being my best friend on earth. this planet is brighter with you by my side. let’s light it up.
user_1;user_144.jpg;when you listen to the sound of stillness...what do you hear? 🦋🦋🦋 the ocean breathes saltwater lullabies through my soul, and i taste the freedom that lingers in release. i cry and dance and laugh at the mystery of this human existence, holding my wounded past in compassion. forgiveness flows through me like summertime rain, and i let the stories of fear unbind my wings. as i rise, others are lifted. as my light strengthens, earth is illuminated. silence is my medicine. my salvation. my cure. constantly bringing me home to myself, no matter how far i wander into the depths of my own mind.
user_1;user_145.jpg;all is well. truly. simply. let yourself melt into the perfection of this moment. unravel the stories that starve your soul. softly release the illusion of control. let it slip through your fingertips as you shift. let your mind taste the nectar of divinity drifting in the depths of your own lungs. inhaling love, exhaling fear. you are safe here. rest in the refuge of your own breath. learn to be tender as you transform. live gently. walk lightly. waves of angelic frequencies are enveloping our mother gaia in a cosmic cloak of divine protection. when i listen to the ones who speak without words, i know that love has already won. so i will choose to remain anchored in the beauty that the earth beneath me effortlessly embodies. the stars, the trees, and the ocean, carry infinite wisdom far beyond this little world. look beyond the surface. let the veils dissolve. we are eternal by nature. deeply intertwined with divinity. forever free. let surrender become your sanctuary.
user_1;user_146.jpg;today, let your inner peace come before everything.
user_1;user_147.jpg;i can honestly say that i really do love myself right now. maybe more than ever before. it feels like coming home. like the warmth of crawling into bed when your sheets and fresh out of the dryer and its raining gently outside. i feel a power growing stronger within me with each breath i take. a reawakened sense of inner knowing that everything is truly going to be okay. i feel freedom flowing through my lungs. i’ve let go of trying to figure life out. my wings have carried me this far. i’ve always had just what i needed in each moment to arrive here. i’m alive. i’m breathing. and this is enough.
user_1;user_148.jpg;just be here right now...let the veils be lifted from your beautiful eyes. you are the sound of stillness in your beating heart. can you hear your spirit calling you home? can you feel the tender kiss of the wind on your skin? the trees and earth are weaving whispers through your ears, reawakening the innocent wisdom of your inner child. soon...you will see love in everything, and everyone, for you have glimpsed the light of heaven within yourself. and as you melt into the delicate nature of your inner being, you will evolve beyond limitation. your soul will come alive again. the illusion of separation will lighten its grasp on your mind, and as your thoughts dissolve into eternal emptiness...you will remember. and you will feel like you are breathing again for the first time. 🦋🦋🦋 this song wasn’t planned at all...which is why it honestly holds such a special place in my heart. i was freestyling and just making up words as i went along with my friend kevin earlier this year in bali and we never even thought about releasing this track until a few months ago. i wanted to share it because it’s from my heart, not my mind. i love you. and i hope this song helps your wings unfold even further...you are eternally free.
user_1;user_149.jpg;she > i.
user_1;user_150.jpg;in the eyes of source, you are perfect. you are effortlessly pure. your soul is sacred. nothing you could ever say or do, nothing that has ever been said or done to you, will change this. the love within you is eternal. it cannot be touched by anything but the hands of divinity, in which you are forever held. seek refuge here. remember who you were before the world told you who you had to be. pure consciousness playing dress up in human form for a little while. to even be alive on this planet right now is such a wild miracle. as a collective, we are gently awakening from our slumber of separation. coming together as the family we always knew we were, before the conditioning, the fear, enslaved our sensitive being. we are returning home. rising upon the wings of ancient wisdom unfolding within us. remember your inner beauty. remember your inner strength. remember your inner light. you are enough. there is no piece of you that needs to be changed. all you need to do, is allow this remembrance to take root within the cells of your body. remember that there is no destination for that which is infinite. you are already free. enjoy the rise.
user_1;user_151.jpg;to all the humans with their head in the clouds and their hearts breathing in oxygen for what feels like the first time...keep rising. you are being purified from the inside out. the process of rebirth is kind of like living inside your house as its being remodeled. it can be messy. and emotional. and uncertain. and sometimes you’ll wonder if the walls of your skin will continue to hold you together as seemingly endless cycles of life and death circulate within the cells of your being. everyone is currently feeling this to a certain degree. trust me. you are not alone. please be gentle and kind to yourself in this state of metamorphosis. it’s okay to slip into a womb of solitude as wings are being stitched into your spine. nurture your delicate nature. remember the beauty of sensitivity. your soul is fluent in emotion. listen. you have everything you could ever need within you. place your faith in energetic frequencies that are unconditional. in the earth beneath you. the sky above you. the beat of your own heart. eat foods in their purest form. surround yourself with light beings who strengthen your evolution. be self reflective. spend time alone with mother gaia. feel the sun on your skin. stay present. stay here. this moment is all that we have for sure. let yourself feel into it. cry. scream. collapse. so you can laugh. dance. and love. release who you were to become who you are. your future needs you. your past doesn’t. you are being reborn. rest easy. this too shall pass. that’s what my mama always tells me. trust. you are love. you are loved.
user_1;user_152.jpg;she was medicine. a single glance reawakened your faith in living miracles. one sip of her nectar made the world wilt at the knees. the words that poured through her left fear gasping for air. all illusion dissolved in her unwaveringly tender presence. humans remembered their gentleness through her devotion to love. she had a wildflower soul. i swear the roots of roses grey within her ribcage. fed by the saltwater rivers birthed through her eyes the day she grew exhausted from holding it all inside. she had died thousands of times in this life, even while her heart continued to beat inside her chest. like a snake, she shed her skin the second it no longer served her. she was constantly changing. caught in the womb of metamorphosis. she was the innocent child, wild and fearlessly alive with curiosity. she answered questions with more questions, getting high off the moments most take for granted. like the sunlight filtering through the leaves of a backyard tree, or the warmth of a hot shower after an ocean swim at dusk. she was an alchemist. a bridge between heaven and earth. breathing love into darkness. turning pain into power. she always had an ethereal glow enveloping her form, as though at any moment, wings may unfold from her delicate spine. few fully understood her, but the ones who did found an eternal home in the depths of her heart. the space between her thighs was a sacred doorway through which pleasure became a prayer that brought those graced by her bedsheets back to life. she was a daughter of the sea. water was her sanctuary. when the voices of those who had abandoned their sensitivity threatened to suffocate her lungs, she rested in the arms of her inner world. away from the chaos and confusion, she gradually became fluent in the language of stillness. it told her there was nothing to prove, no where to go, nothing to do. a flame was growing within her. and soon, the whole world would be bathed in her wildfire of illumination. she is rising.
user_1;user_153.jpg;stay close to the souls who make you feel safe in their silence. sometimes stillness speaks louder than words.
user_1;user_154.jpg;lately i feel like i’ve been experiencing jomo. which stands for: “joy of missing out.” saying no, cancelling plans, to choose myself first. simplying life. slowing down. i just wanted to say, for anyone else feeling the need to be severely introspective/self reflective at this time, your emotions are valid. you aren’t letting this world down. you really don’t have to fix every issue upon this planet. all you have to do is love yourself a little more than you did the day before. keep taking time for yourself until you’re you again. stop rushing to be somewhere or something you’re not. you are exactly where you need to be. right here. right now. this moment is all that exists for sure. might as well live inside it.
user_1;user_155.jpg;peace lives where your walls dissolve.
user_1;user_156.jpg;i feel so much love all around me. it’s almost overwhelmingly beautiful at times. i feel the arms of the infinite holding me. caressing my skin. breathing light into my beautiful little cells. each inhale carries me closer to my inner home. i sense the presence of my ancestors in the ocean waves. their wisdom speaks without words. i see their footprints in the stars enveloping this world in a midnight colored cloak of protection. my faith rests in the earth swirling beneath me. i know a day will come when all beings will feel this sacred interconnection woven through everything. and until this day comes, i will make my life a living prayer. a devotion to love. i seek comfort in knowing that this energy is equally available to all creatures who have the courage to open their heart. to shed their skin and expose their tenderness. sensitivity is our salvation. let yourself feel. feel it all. our emotions illuminate the pathway towards pure libration.
user_1;user_157.jpg;i am at home in this skin. in gentle spaces where the sound of stillness suffocates the the seemingly endless surge of the self sabotaging thoughts living in the corners of my mind. i’ve been starving my fears little by little every single day. listening less to my head. more to my heart. learning to fall in love with my human self and this body is a pretty tumultuous yet beautiful process. getting a few steps ahead only to fall a mile behind at times. some days i look in the mirror and i like what i see. others not so much. this flesh is temporary. ever shifting. every changing. sometimes we get curvier. or thinner. or our faces break out when it’s that time if the month. it’s all normal and natural and divine. i’ve been trying to base my self worth on how i feel more than how i look. easier said than done, obviously. but spending less moments in comparison and more in connection have helped a lot. for the last few weeks, i’ve been outside most of the time. swimming naked in the ocean. holding my kitty luna on the porch as the morning sun warms her fur. afternoon naps. runs at dusk. cooking my friends dinner with ingredients foraged from a farm down the road. i’ve also been a little kinder to myself lately and i feel like this photo reflects that. so here i am. trying to find peace in the space in between who i am and who i want to be. a woman who loves herself inside and out and radiates kindness fiercely. knowing that my highest self is somewhat of an illusion to keep me constantly striving upward. if i ever caught up to her, it would all be over. the road towards her is the fuel for inner growth. which is never ending. if you are still reading this, congratulations. i love you. and i hope you speak nicely to your body today. she listens and absorbs every unspoken thought within you. this is the only current home your soul has to live within.
user_1;user_158.jpg;you cannot hide from love. no matter how hard you try. because you cannot escape the source of energy that composes the very earth spinning beneath your feet. when the weight of your own world becomes too heavy to bear, remember the one that has kept your very spirit alive until now. remember your first breath. the taste of life filling your lungs. remember the purity of water that cleanses your cells. remember the nourishment on your plate that our mother birthed for you. remember the children laughing for the first time. remember the birds unfolding their wings. remember the warmth of sunlight on your skin. remember the sacred rhythm of your own heart. the artistry of divine intelligence is the purest form of self expression that exists. this is why love will always rise over fear. light over darkness. because this is all that is...and all that ever will be. any form of separation is a self imprisoned illusion. i am you. you are me. we are one. remember your divinity. you are the witness of all things. don’t let the strings of this game pull you apart at the seams.
user_1;user_159.jpg;a little reminder that your pain does not make you less worthy. if anything, your suffering heightens your empathy for every living creature upon this earth...thus connecting you to everything that surrounds you. so kiss your wounds tenderly. walk lightly. love fiercely. the strongest souls have not risen by suppressing their weakness. they have found completion through gathering every piece of their precious being, their scars, their fears, their demons...into their arms and saying, “i love you. but i do not need you to protect me from this world any longer.”
user_1;user_160.jpg;i desperately ache for a softer world. a realm where women are kind to their bodies and men feel safe enough to shatter their walls. i believe in a tender humanity. in the little moments of intimacy. like holding hands and unspoken eye contact across a cafe. i believe in long days of nothingness followed by the warmth of a home cooked meal resting gently in your belly. my faith resides in the earth beneath my feet. the sky cradling my wildest dreams in her fingertips. i see god in the ocean waves, i hear her lullaby rising through the lungs of birds unfolding their wings in the early morning light. i pray for a day when we will no longer be controlled by our illusions of insecurity. a day when we will learn to love our beautifully broken pieces. a day when the sound of stillness will drown our thoughts into a subtle peace. when our holiness is measured by the depth at which we forgive. a day when our people will come together as the family we always knew we were. heaven on earth is already here. sometimes you just have to close your eyes to see it.
user_1;user_161.jpg;for the last few years, i feel like i’ve been caught in an endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. my life has been composed of a million highs and lows, many of which you have witnessed. but the further i devote myself to this inner path…the more i ache for the familiarity of like minded souls who to share my journey with. and i know many of you feel the same. i recently hosted a gathering in los angeles with my friends skybear, allie, and jade. the night was beautiful beyond words. getting to see you and hug you in person was the one of the most powerful, fulfilling experiences i’ve had in a long time. i truly feel that it is my purpose to be working with people in person…as you can only connect so far through a screen. this july, i will be hosting my first retreat with some of my beautiful friends in bali. we will be gathering to heal, love, and nurture our inner world. this feels like a new chapter for me. this has been a dream of mine for so long, and it would be an honor to share it with you. it is my hope that this rebirth retreat will serve as a catalyst of reconnection to the emotional nature of your existence. that you will leave not only with a new soul family, but with the courage to listen to that little voice inside. love will never leave you. sometimes you just have to be swallowed into the depths of darkness, to realize this. 🎶: how did i get here // @odesza 🖤 retreat hosted by @skybearb and myself.
user_1;user_162.jpg;you are here to understand yourself...not to be understood. this is something i have to remind myself of every single day. my life doesn’t require an explanation. if i change my mind, it’s okay. if i change, it’s okay. if i grow, it’s okay. if you are reading these words right now, i want you to know that my life isn’t perfect. i want to create art i am proud of, which is why these little squares are beautiful...but this account isn’t a reflection of who i am at my core. it is a channel for my creativity. existence is messy. it’s full of tears and self doubt and insecurities and figuring it out one day at a time. i am not immune to highs and lows of being human. we all have demons we are silently slaying inside. we all have unspoken insecurities that eat away at our minds at night. so please think twice before posting something online. don’t add to the darkness of someone’s inner war. i’ve been sharing my life online since i was 16. and while it has allowed me to have freedom, it has also fucked with my head a fair amount. wanting to speak my truth but feeling the weight of external expectations suffocate my voice. judgments spoken from the fingertips of strangers leaving scars inside my mind. social media has been one of my biggest teachers. it has shown me that you cannot please everyone. and that no matter how vulnerable you are, there will always be people who don’t see you for who you are because they are looking at you through their own perception. and that’s okay. it’s impossible to squeeze your soul into the neat and tidy mental box everyone will attempt to figure you out within. so stop letting other people change the way you see yourself. and stop apologizing for your evolution. it is my hope that when i share my truths and my life, i empower others to do the same through their own experience. my current path may not resonate with yours, and that’s okay. i create art because self expression is empowering as fuck. you never know what someone is going thru, so be kind to all beings. and don’t try to make sense of me. i am still making sense of myself.

user_1;user_164.jpg;sometimes out of no where i’ll get really really sad and i don’t know why. it could be the tiniest glance from someone, a comment from a stranger online, or feeling the weight of unconsciousness still permeating this world. it hits me out of no where and i often find myself immediately stumbling into whirlpools of self sabotaging thoughts, shifting through the mess inside my mind in a desperate attempt to figure out why i’m feeling this way. but i’m slowly learning that just letting myself feel whatever it is, and breathing into the temporary ickiness of it...helps it pass a lot sooner. but yeah. i get sad sometimes. i’m not sure if this is because i’m a pisces, because i’m sensitive, because i’m human, or a combination of all of the above. i don’t like to place labels upon myself because i feel like this only feeds into our conditioned addiction to the bandaid effect...categorizing pieces of ourselves to desperately squeeze into a self contained prison. masking the symptoms on the surface, instead of kissing the root of this wound. whatever it is. i don’t really know that i’m going at here. i just wanted to be open and share this because maybe you feel the same. i am not here to fix anyone’s problems, just to hopefully be someone that makes you feel less alone in the imperfection of this existence. next time darkness or emotional pain arises, try to feel it instead of attempting to rationalize it. at least this is what has helped me...what do you think? ps: breathe to the rhythm of this video...i promise you’ll feel a little lighter. filmed from a cliff i hiked in bali. 🙈 no drone necessary haha. just a curious spirit. 🦋
user_1;user_165.jpg;plot twist: your dreams are chasing you. but you keep running away from them.
user_1;user_166.jpg;have you ever felt so much love that your heart literally aches in your chest? heavy with the weight of emotion that cannot be confined in words, no matter how hard i try. falling in love with you was the easiest thing i’ve done in my entire life. i choose you. and i will continue to. every single day. we aren’t here to fix each other...just to hold hands while we fix ourselves. you are my living reflection. and i couldn’t imagine life any other way. thank you for being the best friend i’ve always wanted. for having dinner ready when i come home. thank you for holding me in your arms when i collapse at 2 am. body shaking. mind bruised in unspoken scars. face slippery with saltwater. thank you for your soft kisses and the smell of your hair in the morning. you feel like a pile of warm clothes straight out of the dryer smothering my body. you look like a million indescribably beautiful sunsets living inside a single human being. i love you so much baby. i know you know. thank you for rubbing my stomach when my period tries to kill me. thank you for being unapologetically you. i’ve never met someone so themselves. you being you is the most beautiful thing i’ve ever seen. you light up every room you enter. thank you for reminding me that life really isn’t that serious. thank you for worshipping my body like art. for mind blowing sex and thai takeout and movie night. thank you for untangling my thoughts that aren’t so nice, and filling me with kinder ones. for seeing my hidden darkness and still sticking around. thank you for listening. really, listening. to everything. i knew you were out there. i just had to learn to love myself first.
user_1;user_167.jpg;as women, we are portrayed as sex objects within this world, yet to embody our own sexuality is perceived as inherently shameful. as though the very skin we have been born into is wrong. as young girls, our intuitive nature is neglected as we are taught to be ashamed of our desires. cut off from our inner source, our creative energy is sucked from our skin. my sexual nature was severely suppressed growing up due to the limiting beliefs pushed upon me, and i often felt ashamed for lustful fantasies that ran through my untamed imagination. i always felt guilty about touching myself and giving love to myself in that way...but over the course of the past few years, i have reawakened my feminine energy through apologetic freedom of expression in all forms. i haven’t worn a bra since i was 16. and i don’t shave my 🐱 either. my hair is unwashed and tangled in saltwater memories. hanging out naked around the house is one of my favorite hobbies hands down. my body is my canvas. human beings are living pieces of art to me. pleasure is our birthright. and i love connecting to my sexuality through myself and my partner whom i trust deeply. 🌟👼🏼💭 for all my girls out there who haven’t experienced the beauty of a female orgasm... i got you. someone described this to me once in this way, and it really helped me. maybe it will help you too. 🤞🏽 close your eyes and imagine peeing. and now, while you are peeing, what muscle would you clench to stop the flow of pee? got it? ok. the muscle is the muscle you will clench to build up to an orgasm. so, next time you are masturbating or making love, try this out. squeeze and focus on pulling your sexual energy up your spine through your chakras. let it rise slowly...until stars rain down all around you. melt into eternal ecstasy. ✨✨✨ i want to hear your story...have you ever had an orgasm? what role has sexuality played in your journey? what has helped you explore this aspect of your being further? 🙈
user_1;user_168.jpg;note...i’m so sorry for making assumptions about anyone’s mental state. all i want to do is help people by sharing what has helped me on my journey. but i know it isn’t fair to make blanketing statements especially about those battling things i know nothing about. i am only sharing from my own experiences. of course nothing is a cure all for mental illness...i am not saying doing these things will make it go away. but please don’t underestimate the power of self love practices while you go through this. your diagnosis is not your identity. there is life to be lived in the darkness. meditation has transformed my life from the inside out. there is still hope inside of you. as human beings, we are all imperfect and messy. it’s part of what we signed up for. but we are all equally connected to a source of love that creates living miracles. and you can heal. i love you. ❤️ this was my post: to anyone reading this currently in depression, get out of bed if you have the energy to. i know you don’t want to do it. a lot of times we are resistant to the things that are best for us because when our soul rises, our ego dissolves. take a shower. feel the warmth on your skin. wash your hair. smile at the face looking back at you in the mirror. self care is so important. this body is the only home your soul has to live inside. how are you treating yourself? how is your mind treating you? don’t let your untamed thoughts bully you into self depreciation. you are beautiful. and you deserve to feel the sun kissing your skin instead of staring into a phone screen first thing in the morning. go outside and move your body. for me, when anxiety arises it is often a symptom of stagnant creative energy inside my body. write yourself a letter. paint a beautiful sunset. make a homemade meal. dance until your limbs are numb. cry if you need to. remember to nurture your inner child. because that is the real you. everything is going to be okay. i love you. i really do. you got this.
user_1;user_169.jpg;hey there! i need your help. 🙈💕✨ so many of you have already joined my app, which is just a safe little sanctuary in this wild world of social media to come home to yourself and feel seen within. there’s even a black hole to spill out your negative thoughts (we all have them), so that the voice of your intuition becomes stronger, beyond all that noise. i’ve been sending you little love notes throughout the day reminding you to take deeper breaths, quiet your mind, and tune back into truth. i just got back from africa a few days ago, and the app is currently an empty canvas. i’d love to include you in this creative process so that this space feels even more like yours. 🌿💭 since we are all connected, share a message below you’d like to hear during your day and i’ll put it into the app notifications! if your present self could somehow send wisdom to your past self, what would you say? ...i can’t wait to read your beautiful words.
user_1;user_170.jpg;this is for the girl who decided to pack up her entire life alongside me at 19 years old and move to a tiny little island in the middle of the pacific ocean. i remember eating baked sweet potatoes in your venice apartment dreaming about how one day we would move to hawaii and when we finally did it, we realized we could make any dream our reality. so we left the jungle and have been readjusting to society ever since. i can honestly say i wouldn’t be as much myself as i am today without your hand spun wisdom, morning pancakes, and warm energy. i look up to you just like this world does. your unconditional humility and gentleness are some of the most beautiful things about you. even in the less than bright moments. like when i crashed your car into a telephone pole or cried my eyes empty after my first heartbreak. you’ve seen me at my worst and still reflected my highest self back to me. to my pisces sister, happy birthday. i can’t wait to devour the millions of books you’ll pour your soul into (thanks for pushing me to finally write my own), and continue to learn how little we know through this messy life together. you are unstoppable. and this year is going to be the most mind blowing one yet. i already know. and to all women out there, moms especially, i see you. i feel you. i love you. i kneel beneath the footsteps of every woman who has walked before me. you have carved the earth we call our refuge today.
user_1;user_171.jpg;well, somehow i survived another lap around the sun on this little planet. just a few bumps along the way. lots of kisses too. this severely sensitive pisces is officially an adult human. woke up this morning with my moon cycle so i’m extra emotional today...but i’ll attempt to keep this short and sweet. (edit: i tried. did not really succeed so if you read this novel, i appreciate you an extra amount.) every aspect of our existence is impermanent. nothing belongs to us. everything flows through this fragile vessel, from the food we consume to the air we breathe. energy is eternally recycled through our being. we are all children of earth. and one day our skin will become soil again. trees will grow through our skeleton and birds will nest in our hair. everything appears to be more beautiful through the veil of past perceptions...so remember to hold this moment close to your heart. drink in the sounds, the tastes, the people that surround you. because none of it will be the same, ever again. emotions are temporary. remind yourself of that when everything feels like it’s crashing down on you. you have made it through moments you thought you would never see the end of. you are still alive. still breathing. this second is yours. and it is enough. i love you as i love myself. thank you for holding space for me as i grow and stretch into all pieces of myself...thank you to my friends and family for keeping me humble and sane in this crumbling matrix. this ride has been wild. and i feel like it’s just beginning. #21 ps: to all my pisces sisters out there!! happy early/late birthday or if i share today with you, that is a beautiful synchronicity! ✨🧜🏼‍♀️💦 take a bath or dip your toes in some water today. stay grounded and don’t let your emotions rule your life haha. i know legs are hard to get used to when you’ve spent lifetimes underwater but it gets easier in time. i promise. 🌈
user_1;user_172.jpg;i wish for a world where humans are kinder. where kisses taste sweet with humility and don’t leave young girls wide awake at night, wondering if they will ever be enough. i wish for eyes that see myself in all creatures. for a heart that remains whole no matter how many cracks are wrapped around her surface. i wish for more moments of timelessness. seconds so unimaginably beautiful you forget where you are and who you are and let laughter spill from your lips for how precious this fragile little life is. i wish for emotions that are felt unapologetically. for saltwater to pour from your eyes and lighten the heaviness you’ve been carrying for far too long. i wish for a universal language fluent in faith instead of fear. i wish for second chances. for forgiveness to envelope your soul and remind you that everything will be okay. even when it doesn’t feel like it. especially when it doesn’t feel like it. i wish for arms that will hold you in unconditional warmth. i wish for morning coffee with the perfect ratio of cream and a body to be tangled in when it is grey and sad outside. i wish for families to be reunited in peace. i wish for bruises to heal and scars to fade. i wish for children to have the courage to make their voice heard in a world that desperately starves for the stories of innocence. i wish for love. may it find you. may it become you. may you never forget that your heart is alive and beating. that you are deserving of every single unspoken dream that keeps you up at night. keep going, gentle warrior. heaven is on your side. 🌏🌿 @justdiggit thank you for your dedication to nurturing mother earth and healing our world. it has been an honor to make this planet more beautiful with you. ✨ time lapse by @nybcp. 🎶 @zhu my life.
user_1;user_173.jpg;i woke up this morning to the gentle rumble of a purr rising from the tangle of trees and honey painted grass blanketing the savannah. i blinked my eyes open, and rubbed the rose colored dust gathered at the edges of my lashes, hoping to catch a glimpse of the wild cat. inhaled the taste of warm earth and the sounds of birds unfolding their wings, singing to the sun. auburn light spilled over my skin. the wind softly enveloped my soul in waves of silence. i felt at home, even far away from the familiarity of our little city apartment and his arms wrapped around me. when you have a soul connection with someone, they are always with you. the energy of every life you’ve touched is imprinted on your heart. this trip has opened my eyes to the beauty of our own humanity. there are so many good humans out here on this planet. beings who breathe hope into the wounds of their brothers and sisters, knowing that we all belong to the same beating heart. earth is healing. right here. right now. so keep your head up, little one. faith will always rise over fear. 📷: @jasmina.toivonen
user_1;user_174.jpg;i’ve stared at this image for the last few hours, attempting to write out a messy thread of words. but i keep coming up empty. i suppose some moments simply speak for themselves. this was one of them. morning light in kenya. march 1st. feeling humbled and grateful. overwhelmed with emotion as usual. i’m a pisces. my heart lives in my head. all i really want to say is, thank you. to the earth. to her creatures. to humankind. hope trembles softly in my chest. my lungs are breathless.
user_1;user_175.jpg;stop saying sorry for the things that make you beautifully human. you are not a living mistake that needs to be fixed. you are a little miracle placed delicately upon this pale blue planet. if the universe didn’t need you, you would not be here. 🐘🌾 so honored to be with the @justdiggit team here in kenya. they are literally reversing climate change through rehabilitating wild spaces, creating sanctuaries for the beautiful animals living here, and making this earth a safe space for all beings once more. so happy to be filming this project with humans who are doing so much good in this world. keep posted on my stories for all of our adventures here. ✨ #justdiggitambassador
user_1;user_176.jpg;a species cannot be controlled unless there is a collective perception of external illusion carved into “reality” over time. all that surrounds us is a reflection of our current state of consciousness. this is why self love is our cure. this mirror is our medicine. when you devote yourself to this path of evolving awareness, when you heal your inner world, a new earth will arise through your fingertips. i know the path feels lonely sometimes. the external voices that attempt to crowd your mind can leave your body achingly empty inside. devoid of grace. numb to emotion. as human beings, we are deeply intuitive creatures. we all feel. we all cry. we all crumble. but when we refuse to cradle our wounds in our own fingertips, their scars stretch further around your soul. blocking you from feeling anything at all. we need to return to our emotions. to honor and see them for what they are, pathways illuminating the power of our inner self. have the courage to live life backwards. feel your emotions. follow your fears. trust uncertainty. continue to chose yourself. devote your relentless heart to your deepest desires. embody your truth. be. live. this is more than enough. this is everything. you were made by love, for you, to love. so do that. and one day, we will all break free.
user_1;user_177.jpg;hey there! 🕊🌿 here’s a few things you can do right now instead of scrolling thru your phone: go to a farmers market. make a homemade meal with an ingredient you’ve never tried before. call your mother. write a love song. write poetry. write until your wounds soften. declutter your room. if something doesn’t spark joy inside you, give it away. take a moment to close your eyes and envision your wildest dreams. braid your hair. do fifteen squats. start a youtube channel. (may be scary at first, but the ability to connect to this world is worth it.) learn a new skill. like painting. or yoga. or martial arts. breathe. just breathe. give yourself a foot massage. tickle your best friend. it’s an immediate energetic reset. rebirth your closet at a local thrift store. listen to the sound of stillness. stare at the clouds until they become creatures. walk down your street and pretend you’re an alien seeing this world for the first time. what is strange and beautiful in this renewed perception? climb a tree. feel the warmth of mama earth beneath your bare feet. feel grateful. you are alive. and this is enough. 🦁 mane by: @christinesilvermancolor
user_1;user_178.jpg;i want to be a voice for the unspoken stories. for the ones who are sculpting selfless energy into this earth. who are healing the ground beneath our feet with humility and grace. i want to be the lungs that breathe life into broken places. one of my intentions for this year was to create for others instead of myself. a few weeks ago, i woke up to an email that would change the course of my life. i was presented with the chance to pack up my camera and capture a project that is reversing climate change all the way across the world. justdiggit makes dry land green again by capturing rainwater and introducing sustainable agriculture to create healthy ecosystems. they have healed earth all throughout africa, making it useful for their local community. all they need is help spreading their message. so i said yes. and here i am. trembling with anticipation two days before i board a flight to africa. i am deeply humbled by these dreams coming to life. thank you for choosing to create with me. @justdiggit #justdiggitambassador
user_1;user_179.jpg;as highly empathic beings, we absorb the energy of all that surrounds us unless we remain centered within ourselves. and sometimes being “centered” is not as easy as it sounds in our age of over stimulating external distractions. over time our sense of self has become diluted. we have lost touch with the truth of who we are. anxiety should not be a social norm. but currently, it is. and the only way out, is within ourselves. healing our connection to this land and our spirit. a long time ago, our earth mother graced us with guides that would help our evolution one day. mary jane medicine has a massive role to play. but right now, most do not have access to her beauty. so a little nectar was extracted from her leaves, and CBD was created. the first time i put a few little drops of this plant under my tongue, i had no idea what i was getting my sensitive self into. long story short, i felt fear loosen it’s grip on me. my thoughts spoke kinder to me than they had in months. the tension in my shoulders eased, i could breathe a little deeper. i just felt super relaxed and calm, without the mental high i have experienced smoking santa maria. over the next few days, my sleep became deeper, taste became sweeter, energy became purer. and the fogged windows of reality began to fade into unity. less external voices attempted to crowd my head. my intuitive nature rose higher. i’ve been talking CBD daily ever since, and i cannot recommend this enough to anyone who is currently struggling with anxiety, bodily pain, insomnia, or even living a beautiful life and wanting it to be even more peaceful and reflective. when we allow nature to heal, without getting in the way, we become the living witness to a million little miracles every single day. we are reaching a point in time where we can rely upon our instincts over our past conditionings. where we can source out the ancient wisdom of this beautiful blue globe, instead of our tiny perceptions, for she has been watching this unfold since before a single footprint lay upon her surface. it is time to return home. 🌱🐍 what is your experience with cbd? how has this planet affected your life? please open my mind below. 💭
user_1;user_180.jpg;...when you smile at a stranger and they smile back at you.
user_1;user_181.jpg;don’t put me on a pedestal, for my true power rests in humility. see my fragile human life as a mirror of your own. for i am still wounded. i am still learning. i am still growing. and there is so much beauty in that. if children gave up when they fell for the first time, they would never learn how to walk.
user_1;user_182.jpg;no one really teaches you about self love in school. instead of learning rituals to clear our minds, our heads are filled with useless noise and memorized chaos that doesn’t fulfill our deepest dreams in the long run. (note: if you are in school and truly feel fulfilled with this as your path, this is powerful and beautiful. i am merely speaking on behalf of my own high school experience and for the people who feel as though there is only one set path for success. 🙏🏼 try to keep an open mind.) unravelling years of societal programming has unearthed my sensitivity. our emotional nature as human beings is the source of our intuition. it is the voice that speaks softly and gently. the unspoken whisper that tells you to do this, and not that. fueled by feeling over logic. but sometimes this inner compass becomes buried beneath the unconsciousness of our thoughts. but it’s ok. because there are ways to find your heart again. to breathe life into your soul, surrendering to the sound of instinctual knowing running through your core. a few things i do to nurture my intuition is limiting my use of external distractions, breathing deeply, drinking celery juice, moving my physical body, and being appreciative of every aspect of my current reality. i just uploaded a self love ritual video on youtube....comment below your favorite ways to take care of yourself if you’ve seen it. ✨🌼🌻💫
user_1;user_183.jpg;i wrote something for you. recorded it on my phone. threaded it through these moments. and here it is. a piece of me in your hands. something raw and slightly unfinished and i had resistance to posting this (singing is still something that feels super vulnerable to me) but my heart pulled me to share anyways. unapologetic self expression is the source of creation itself. maybe you will feel a less alone in this wild after listening. this is my hope. for everyone. heaven is within you. close your eyes. so you can see.
user_1;user_184.jpg;i love you, because i love myself. and i see myself in you. #reflection

user_1;user_186.jpg;people may attempt to make sense of you from the prison they occupy within their own mind. don’t allow yours to be caged by bars that do not even belong to you.
user_1;user_187.jpg;lately, i’ve been trying to find peace in the space between who i am and who i want to be. sometimes the distance feels suffocating. often i wonder what i am even doing as i wander aimlessly around this big blue planet, finding balance in the endless sea of uncertainty, and searching for an answer to a question i can’t even put into words. sometimes all i can do, is just breathe. fill my lungs with the colors of mama earth and paint my insides bright again. being drenched in the energy of pure souls who love without condition always helps as well. human connection is everything. 🌕🌼✨ if you have a moment...pour some love into someone in the comments. just choose anyone you feel pulled to. you can ever scroll until your heart tells you to stop, and then let that human know that you see them. anything has the power to heal or hurt us. lets use this little device in our hands to weave wildflowers into the wounds of this virtual world. or if you are in need of emotional support for anything in life eight now, spill your soul. pour out the chaos of your thoughts, so your mind can rest easy. everyone is fighting an unseen battle we know nothing about, yet most of our inner wars are linked by a common thread of isolation. lets shift that.
user_1;user_188.jpg;your sensitivity is not a curse. it is your compass.
user_1;user_189.jpg;✨☕️🔮🦄📝🌟 eternal mood....@alexisrakun 💭🐱💫 thank you for somehow capturing my soul in a single image + for sharing your cosmic creativity with this world. this pretty much sums up my past few weeks...feeling all the feels, writing until my fingers hurt, drinking endless chais, being kind to my mind, unravelling my inner child, lighting sage, exploring my sexual nature, talking to cats, listening to the gentle hum of ocean waves, creating who i want to be while i make peace with who i currently am...trusting every little step along the way. the baby flower sprout 🌱 is still the flower. don’t rush your petals...they will unfold when it’s time.
user_1;user_190.jpg;“This Full Blood Moon, Lunar Eclipse is in the first degree of Leo. This impact is like a Full Moon, on Steroids. Your personal life, your emotions, your relationships, your home and family, are all likely areas where this impact will be felt. This is a cosmic RESET and the opportunity to release, from your subconscious all memories connected to a 3D past, that are no longer desired. This then, opens the floodgates of awareness in ALL areas impacted within you. The Light rushes in ~ you AWAKEN more. There are no limits to the possibilities, that once were dormant within you. Do not under-estimate the powers that be. This is going to be an eclipse for us to empower ourselves and use this Leo energy to choose to begin sharing who we are or if we are already doing so, to expand into new ways of being and doing things. Even for many who have been in this evolutionary path for a while, things are changing, for even though we live outside of the matrix, we also have our fixed ways of doing things, of being and of even sharing, and for many this is a phase to surrender, hold unconditional trust and begin to do things in new ways, even though it can seem scary for the human self. The main Essence of this powerful Leo Eclipse is one of creativity, higher connection to our heart and healing. Leo is all about self-empowerment and nurturing the individualized aspect of Creation that we are. Leo is a very courageous sign, who loves himself and behaves as the empowered and sovereign being that He is, remembering his true potential and Divine heritage. Leos stand firm in their own beliefs, honoring who they are and truth above All. As Leo also rules the heart, it is an opportunity for us to move beyond our limited sense of the self to find unity with All.” ~e r a o f l i g h t ✨🌕 #doyoufeeltheshift? #severelyemotional? #sensitivityisactuallyasuperpower #everythingsgonnabeok #ipromise
user_1;user_191.jpg;don’t forget to give yourself a hug today and say silently, “i love you. i forgive you. thank you.”
user_1;user_192.jpg;saltwater womb. my forever home. you know me deeper than i know myself. a liquid blanket of love wrapped around this beautiful world...thank you for cradling me in your waters. you have given me life itself.
user_1;user_193.jpg;to anyone who has ever attempted to darken my light, hurl fear at my heart, or spoken unkindness towards me...i wish i could take your pain away. i wish i could gather you into my arms and hold you until you learn to let go. until you stop fighting this war against yourself. i know we all ache for belonging, and hurt people hurt people. but beautiful child, these lashes are only inflicting scars into your own skin. as a beautiful being named martin luther king once said, “hate will never dissolve hate. only love can do that.” and i want you to know that i love you still, despite it all. for i see myself in you. i have hurt people without meaning to. i still do sometimes, in my human imperfection. but there is love in me still. and there is love in you, too. i forgive you. and i thank you for making me that much stronger. one day, our souls will be one again. but until then, i will be holding out my arms to you in unconditional compassion, until the day you finally shatter your walls and surrender. until the day that love become your fluent language again. love, me. xx
user_1;user_194.jpg;just so everyone knows: sometimes as women, when we are on our moon cycle, our womb area becomes swollen and may appear to be bloated. this is 200% okay and natural. i am learning to love and accept my body unconditionally in all of her forms. she has carried me through so much...kept me alive even when i despised the very skin i was born within. this body is a work of art. no matter how she shifts in her natural cycles, i will still love and embrace her. this is the very least i can do. i am a living miracle. and you are too.
user_1;user_195.jpg;tenderness is truth.
user_1;user_196.jpg;sometimes, life gets worse before it gets better. as human beings living within this beautifully chaotic world, our existence is woven together by a threads of delicate impermanence. change is our only constant. we are caught in an endless state of becoming. breathing creation itself through our lungs. so it would only make sense that in this eternal womb of metamorphosis, darkness is essential to our inner evolution. your soul starves for experiences to fuel her growth. and often the most powerful truths and unearthed in moments of discomfort. learn to fall in love with uncertainty, and she will take you on one hell of a ride. let your fears excite you instead of isolating you. it’s pretty fun to surrender and say f🌼🌸🌻 it completely, then watch as the pieces of your life gradually come together in peace through spontaneous synchronicities and blind leaps of faith into the wild unknown. i had really no goal or plan in coming to aus, i just knew i needed to. the people and moments i’ve experienced here in one week are beyond what i could have dreamed. so journey on kids. earth is getting good again. keep your head up. ✨

user_1;user_198.jpg;sometimes i wonder if i even know what i look like. all i know of my appearance is the image i see in the mirror, filtered through self distortion, and moments captured through the lens of past experiences. you don’t see yourself in all those beautiful little moments when they are happening. right then and there. you don’t see your sleepy face in the morning, moon dust lingering beneath your lashes, limbs curled into the warmth of messy sheets. you don’t see yourself laughing out loud, so hard at a bad joke that your stomach aches. you don’t see yourself collapsing within the warmth of a human being who knows you better than you know yourself. you don’t see yourself in the raw moments that compose this very existence itself. having sex, swimming in the ocean, giving a stranger a helping hand, cuddling with your cat, sipping on your morning coffee, smiling at the stars. maybe if you could somehow see this you, you would fall in love with how beautiful you truly are.

user_1;user_1101.jpg;if you are constantly attempting to survive in the endless game of our external reality, instead of taking care of the world living within you, your physical form will begin to self sabotage in order to create the distance and solitude your soul is starving for. listen to the little voice beneath your skin. it is always speaking to you. in moments, people, and unspoken symbols. beauty is born through chaos, but nurtured in stillness. surrender.
user_1;user_1102.jpg;☕️ a few fun facts for your sunday morning:  1. i always suck on my tea bags (...it’s the best part). 2. webkinz was my only allowed online activity as a child. 3. i was obsessed with nancy drew. 4. and climbing trees. 5. sometimes both at the same time. 6. my mom created homemade raw blueberry cheesecake for every birthday i had. 7. i believed in fairies until i was 10. 8. i still believe in fairies. 9. i am twenty years old. 10. i am also a five ten feet tall giraffe. 11. my favorite hobbies include anchoring light into the consciousness of this earth, watching rain drops race each other down the windows, laughing until my insides ache, and making homemade mac n cheese for my friends. 12. i can only fall asleep on my back. 13. hawaii is home. 14. i feel this on such an indescribably deep soul level, no matter how many times i’ve left this little island, her call to return becomes more powerful each time. living simply is living at peace, in my opinion. 15. one of my biggest dreams is to create a healing sanctuary on kauai with ato nurture the collective rise of the feminine. 16. intentional use of psychedelics has singlehandedly transformed my perception of this reality. i am eternally grateful for plant medicine for helping me so i can help others. 17. my favorite color is the ocean. because it contains all colors. 18. i’m secretly a mermaid and i plan to grow my tail back in this lifetime. 19. pretending to be sane in a mad world is the definition of insanity to me. i’d rather be crazy and live this beautiful life fully, than always wonder “what if?” 20. all i want is to love. 21. and be loved.
user_1;user_1103.jpg;nearly all of my clothing is kissed by the colors of earth. the dirt buried beneath my fingertips is a symptom of seemingly endless seconds spent in stillness. listening to the gentle giants. the mountains. the ocean. the forest. the untamed beauty of these creatures wrestle my thoughts into a tangle of roots and rivers. pulling me inward. turning fear to fragile love. making my head quiet again. so i can listen. so i can hear the little lullabies sung through the lungs of this eternal home. she tells me there will be a day when the veils between heaven and earth will dissolve once more. everyone will remember their wings. and we will see that we have been dancing with angels disguised as humans, all along. be patient and trust that your path is unfolding towards the hands of unconditional compassion. in every breath. in every step. don’t let your soul to be suffocated by the chaos of this world. be nurtured by the warmth living inside your saltwater sun stained skin. this is your sanctuary. this is your home.
user_1;user_1104.jpg;i feel as though this past year was composed of a never ending surge of contrast. unforgettably beautiful highs paralleled by mind shattering blows. i am continuously humbled to be alive and be human during this collective shift in consciousness on planet earth, and so deeply grateful to the humans who have been beside me in spirit through all of it. the light and the dark. you know who you are. thank you. so many of the inner wounds i thought i had healed resurfaced this year, bringing me home to the simple truth that every time i seek beyond the simplicity that stillness effortlessly encompasses, i am again reminded that no external source can ever fuel the hunger for sacred union within. sometimes we spiral into past patterns just so that the lessons can sink in even further. i feel like one of my biggest attachments i am learning to let go of is the need for approval of others. which is a difficult one when you are just twenty years old and still figuring yourself out. the deeper i commit to this journey of inner understanding, and taking full responsibility for every aspect of my current reality, the wilder this trip becomes. there is nothing and no one to hide from. everything is happening at once. and this happening is beautiful. no matter what shape your evolution takes, it is essential that you release attachment to how things should be, and accept with unconditional awareness, how things are. take care of this inner world. give your soul every ounce of nourishment it is begging for at this time. we are experiencing massive shifts on a collective level, and you may feel as though you are emotionally and physically exhausted at this time, unable to be fully present amongst friends and family. it’s ok to tune out for a little while. take a nap. or two. or three. listen to the sounds of mother earth. immerse your senses in solitude. give, but never from your own cup. love grows from the inside out. pour from your inner overflow.
user_1;user_1105.jpg;do you remember your dreams in the morning when you wake up? 💭 for the last three days, i’ve been recording a voice memo the moment i wake up (it’s easier then writing for me), recalling any details i can remember from my sleeping state. the first few nights i didn’t remember anything, but last night i had a dream that i swam with these massive tigers in a river somewhere in africa...but there were massive walls locking us in. like we were trapped together in an outdoor cage stretching on for miles and miles. such a trip. i want to get better at interpreting my dreams because i feel like our astral world is just as important as our waking world in this reality. our dreams carry so many hidden messages for us. i really want to get better at remembering my dreams, so if you have any tips please leave them below. do you have a dream journal? or any nighttime routines that heighten your sense of inner awareness in this realm? let me know. 🦋
user_1;user_1106.jpg;for all my fellow mermaid pisces soul sisters...water is so important for our inner wellbeing. drinking it. being in it. playing in it. everything. if you don’t have access to a lake/river/ocean close to home, just try taking a shower first thing in the morning and rinsing the sleepy energy from your skin and i promise you will feel sooo good. slipping into the ocean at dawn is like caffeine for my soul. the sea is a liquid blanket wrapped around our entire earth and it is so humbling to be held in something so powerful and gentle in the same breath...it brings me right back home, every single time. 100X better than coffee in the mornings haha. i swear i feel more comfortable in water than on land. 🙈 ...anyone else?
user_1;user_1107.jpg;each morning, speak softly to the soul that lives within your skin. say, “i love you. you are enough. i will be kind and patient with you as you evolve and grow. every second of our journey together is sacred. there is nothing you could ever do that would separate me from you. you are enough. forever and always.”
user_1;user_1108.jpg;the moment you allow yourself to recognize your current experience as a reflection of your evolution rather than a victimizing situation, you will see the gift of growth in everything.
user_1;user_1109.jpg;people will love you. people will hate you. ...and none of it, will have anything to do with you. so keep your chin up little one. you are strong enough to be gentle. if you feel lost, hopeless, or emotionally exhausted, it’s ok to hit the pause button right now. i feel you. i’m with you. since i’ve landed here i’ve been feeling so much. all i want to do is sleep and be alone in nature. a lot of my friends are feeling this wave of stillness too, so let’s just ride it out together. learn to listen to your inner cycles. draw inward. curl up into your cocoon. slow down. breathe. remember that the energy within you is untouchable. it cannot be wounded by anyone, or anything. only you can chose to hurt or heal the physical reality existing beyond this edge of inner infinite. your body carries every self induced scar. every unspoken dream. every word your lips have never have the courage to spill. your mind is stained with moments and memories that are precious and sacred to you. so be kind and gentle to this body. this human skin. for you experience this very reality through it. the better you feel, the better this world will become. drink lots of water. eat sweet potatoes with sea salt sprinkled on top. make a home beneath your sheets. sleep longer if you need to. sink your bare feet into the earth. run. move. play. do not abandon the little things. for they compose everything.
user_1;user_1110.jpg;eternally enough.
user_1;user_1111.jpg;just a little kid with grown up powers living within this endlessly shifting cluster of cells and stars. i love my untamed mane and the little dimple in my chin. my saltwater skin is littered in scars and mud freckles. my boobs are free from the confines of wires and push up bras. i currently own one pair of army boots i found at a roadside thrift store in california. bali somehow swallowed up everything i was carrying with me that i didn’t need. i can’t remember the last time i brushed my hair. or washed it, for that matter. my arms are blanketed in sun bleached wisps. my mind is an emotional mess composed of everything raw and alive in this wild world. a little snake lives above the surface of my beating heart. she reminds me that it’s ok to shed your skin. its ok to grow. to change. that you are not how other people see you. you are how you see you. there are many different versions of me living inside the heads of others...all i want, is to make peace with my own beautiful mess.
user_1;user_1112.jpg;how you treat anyone, is how you treat everyone. #chooselove
user_1;user_1113.jpg;a mind consumed by ego will always attempt to cage it’s creation. it will seek to suffocate the breath of artistic expression which naturally flows through us all. beauty is our birthright. but the love that surrounds us is not ours to possess. nothing belongs to us. everything flows through this physical vessel, from the food we consume to the air we breathe. this energy is eternally recycled through our being itself. we are all children of earth. and one day our skin will become soil again. trees will grow through our skeleton and birds will nest in our hair. until we surrender to all that we are not...we will continue to search for wisdom beyond the walls of this body. constantly attempting to grasp onto something so indescribably beautiful, yet every time you stretch out your fingers, it somehow flies further from your reach. maybe we should just learn to leave our hand open instead. so that all the little butterflies can find freedom in our fingertips. what is meant to be, will always return home to your touch.
user_1;user_1114.jpg;👽 hello there. what are 3 things you have learned to love about yourself within the last year? 💭 mine are: 1. my endless addiction to inner growth. i often find myself abandoning situations which cage me within the confines of safety...even though something is easy, doesn’t mean it is good for you. the more i trust the uncertainty of this universe, the more myself i become. challenges strip away self induced layers of conformity that were never meant to be there in the first place. 2. my elfish nose. it’s like a little ski jump on a human face haha. i used to be so insecure as a teenager, and literally wanted to shift everyone about my physical appearance from the size of my boobs to my giraffe legs to the little gap in between my front teeth. over time, the distorted perception of my body is healing, and gradually i’m learning to love more of what makes me, me than the day before. 3. my childlike wonder for mother earth. especially the ocean. i’ve never felt more at home than floating way out in the middle of the sea, cradled in saltwater, staring up at the cloudless sky suspended above my head. nothing can touch you out there. the dirt, the forest, the jungle...these imperfectly perfect elements bring me back home to myself. every single time. ps: filming a q+a tomorrow for youtube!! 🙈🤞🏽 check two posts back to ask any final questions. also wrote a blogpost about the magic of cbd on my website. 🌱 link is in my bio. xx
user_1;user_1115.jpg;hey. if you are currently scrolling thru this little app, buried beneath your bed sheets, trying to escape from the aching emptiness inside your head...i feel you. i was you. i am you. i am still walking the thin line between making peace with who i am, and who i want to be. better. stronger. wiser. a woman who loves fiercely, and speaks unapologetically. who walks this human path of impermanence and sends ripples through the roots of time. but at the same time...i’m still a little kid who forgets she is a being of love sometimes, in this wild world. a few things that help me are stripping down naked and looking at myself in the mirror each morning. sculpting coconut oil into every curve and limb of this body and saying i love you over and over even if i don’t feel it in that moment. i used to be a girl who hid from her reflection in every mirror she passed, and some days i still struggle to unconditionally accept the skin that carries this soul. self love is not a pill you can take overnight. i still have to show up for myself every single day. i still have to breathe in between bites, to ensure i’m not burying my emotions. i still have to check in with humans i trust, who support me from spiraling into patterns of self sabotage. it’s ok to ask for help. from friends. from earth. saltwater is usually my drug of choice. and often times i am my own dealer, given my severely sensitive nature and the fact that i cry at least once a day. but recently...i’ve been shedding more happy tears than sad ones. and this is all we can hope for. to be better than we were yesterday.
user_1;user_1116.jpg;my human. 🖤 thank u for putting up with my 10000s of emotions each day. for forgiving me for all the things i say when im hungry. for your sensitive energy and unconditional warmth. for holding me in your strong arms when this world is too wild for me to carry. i would swim across oceans and grow legs for you any day. i am so happy we found each other again. this trip is my favorite one so far...lets keep going. 👽
user_1;user_1117.jpg;one of the most powerful nuggets of mom wisdom i ever received growing up was, “be kind to every being you meet, because everyone is fighting an unseen inner battle you know nothing about.” seeing life through this perception allows you the freedom to take nothing personally, for you can recognize the unconscious actions of another as a reflection of their own inner wounding. everyones mind is messy, and nothing ever has anything to do with you. not even that one thing. i promise. people may attempt to confine your beauty, your power, and your strength, to the limits of their own preconceived beliefs, but continue to speak your truth. now is not the time to be silent. we need to come together and rise as a collective. compassion is infectious. people will always see you through their inner perceptions, so at the end of the day, all you can do learn to be unconditionally loving to all. hold that mirror of kindness so strongly, even to those who aren’t loving to you. because they need love the most. this is something i’m still working on, for sure. social media has given me a pretty tough skin, but i still let myself get hurt by opinions and thoughts that don’t even below to my own mind. i’m curious, what has helped you shatter the confining expectations of those that surround you? what had allowed you to break free from the rules that do not below to you? 👽👽👽
user_1;user_1118.jpg;see the light as it shines on the sea? it’s blinding. but no one knows, how deep it goes. and it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me. and let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
user_1;user_1119.jpg;you know that thing you’ve been meaning to do? this is your sign. write your dream here. then go do it. 🕊 (ps: ...and let me tell you a little secret. this dream, is you. you know the unspoken thoughts keeping you up at night, staring into the emptiness, wondering why you are, where you are? wishing for something else? the little voice inside of you is trying to tell you something. are you listening? or is your mind consumed by the chaos of this external world, the noise attempting to tame the unwavering source of strength trembling beneath your surface. begging to be unbound. freedom lingers at the edge of your fear. dimming your light in order to stay safe isn’t helping anyone. burn your brightest. unleash your inner power. scatter pieces of your soul like wildflowers across the entire world. see in color. let go.)
user_1;user_1120.jpg;👽✨👅 hey you. sometimes being a human being on earth isn’t easy. but here are a few things that have helped me inside this simulation: 1. learn to see with your eyes closed. listen to the little voice living within. you know more than you think you do. trust your intuition. 2. wake up earlier. your mind is super sensitive at this time, so fuel it with pure energy. don’t look at your phone first thing in the morning. go outside. drink in the taste of dawn. 3. embody a constant state of gratitude. your heart is beating. your lungs are full. you are alive. and this, is enough. 4. say “i love you” when you look into the mirror. 5. think kinder thoughts. speak softer words. 6. listen to the innocent ones. children and animals are wiser than we ever will be. 7. embrace your raw beauty. unwind your hair. go barefoot more often. let the ferns tickle your toes. dance in the rain. climb trees. swim naked in rivers. let planet earth become your living playground. 8. drink more water. eat your veggies. animals are our friends, remember? 9. smile at strangers. every human has hidden wings, if you look deep enough. 10. spend more time in silence. meditation is medicine. stillness heals even the deepest of wounds. 11. see people as they are in this present moment, free from past perceptions. change is symptom of growth. 12. saltwater is medicine. tears or the ocean. or both. at the same time. best thing ever. 13. feel your feelings. it’s ok to be sad sometimes. but it’s ok to be happy, too. there is so much here to smile about. like rainbows and vegan waffles and ben howard. 14. make more home cooked meals.  say what you love about people out loud. 15. don’t assume. anything.  16. live life backwards. be fiercely passionate. follow your fears. trust uncertainty. nurture the dreams of your inner child. they will set us free. 17. you know that thing you’ve been meaning to do? feel the fear. and do it anyway. self doubt will suffocate you. shatter it in unshaken faith. 18. and...remember.  choose yourself, first. self love is the purest form of selfless energy known to humankind. you cannot give from an empty cup.  overflow. xx

user_1;user_1122.jpg;🕊 you are my favorite emotion.
user_1;user_1123.jpg;hi sunshine. 🌻✨ short story short: i just want you to know that i love you. long story long: shoutout to the humans have believed in me since day one. since i was eating bowls of banana ice cream drizzled in maple syrup on my back porch senior year of high school, talking about how one day i wanted to live on an island. flash forward one year. i left home at 18. booked a one way ticket to hawaii. lived in a little jungle shack and sold hand written post cards of a moon goddess painting for a living. swam in the stars. painted sun freckles onto my skin. saw my soul thru the eyes of my inner child and fell in love for the first time. with myself. mother earth has taught me everything i know. she is effortlessly fluent in love. and i am still learning to speak her language in human words. but along the way, i have made mistakes. countless one. i have both hurt and healed others with my voice. going from living inside a real jungle to a concrete one will naturally shake anyone up a little bit, especially when you are severely sensitive to everything. (...literally. everything. shoutout to all the other infp’s out there. surviving and thriving.) i let go of my mama island, because she taught me i carry my home within. she taught me how to fly. so i went to a city of angels, to find other humans with hidden wings. because sure, one soul can save the world. but it’s more fun to do together. are you in?
user_1;user_1124.jpg;out of the matrix garden their souls began to unharden fear softened within a womb woven by surrender herself words wrote themselves silly and people thought in feelings we learned to see with our eyes closed collected moments spun by liquid gold kids were our teachers the earth was our home the sky cried tears of laughter as we were reborn through the beauty of pure human indecision. 🖤 @ianahealey ...tomorrow we may paint a whole new world to play within.
user_1;user_1125.jpg;the other night, i was on my way home and the radio wasn’t working. i drove for a while in the stillness, the fading light painting roadside trees in auburn honey. the only sound, my breath and the tires endlessly spiraling beneath me. i started to hum. lungs warming gently until a little whisper rose from my lips. sang for the first time in a long time. i recorded a raw voice memo on my iphone. this is my little rip tide...i hope it makes you feel safe inside. if someone hasn’t told you yet today, everything is going to be ok. 🦋 @vancejoy
user_1;user_1126.jpg;the taste of saltwater wafts lazily through the open window of a kitchen littered with muddy pawprints. a sliver of dawn traces its way down the hall as light spills onto our sheets. a place where nothing exists but the sound of our breath and beating hearts. endlessly echoing through my mind. melting into eternity. your arms are my refuge between heaven and earth. the warmth of your touch is aching familiar. i could swim in our ocean forever. we are currently living within a little surf bungalow nestled along a secluded stretch of coastline. our backyard has become an untamed garden infused in butterflies and homegrown tomatoes. plants blanket the countertops in an emerald sea. i can’t remember the last time i washed my hair or wore shoes. my skin is freckled in sun kisses and handmade stories. time stands still as we sway. collecting moments. surfing til dusk. pouring our dreams onto paper. this is the place where we realize that nothing matters and nothing is everything and everything is love. there is nothing to do here, but be. and i love being with you.
user_1;user_1127.jpg;marigold musings 🐝✨ ...i know you like hearing my thoughts...so thank you for being gentle with me as i walk the thin line between embodying vulnerability and protecting my inner child on this platform. i know my voice matters. everyones does. lately....my mind feels lost in a maze of mirrors. so many reflections. so many voices. all beautiful...but sometimes my own song becomes buried beneath sounds that do not belong to me. i am what you may call severely self reflective and tend to experience thousands of emotions every single day. one minute i’ll be on top of the world and the next i’ll be collapsed beneath the blankets, sadness pouring from my eyes. good thing i love the ocean more than anything else in this world, as i’m often swimming in saltwater rivers running down my skin. i am grateful for my sensitivity, because it gives me compassion for others and let’s me connect to every living creature on such a deep level. some people think this means i have a problem, that i am bipolar or weird, but i have really just learned to fall in love with the beauty of being human and surrendering to my emotions in each present moment is part of the process. emotions are energy in motion. if you don’t feel them, they will get stuck inside your skin and suffocate your creative energy. sometimes it’s not easy feeling so much, being so young, with thousands of eyes watching me evolve and unfold. please remember that i am still in my cocoon too. still learning. still growing. i can only fly, when you can. because none of us are alone.

user_1;user_1156.jpg;i am learning to see this world through the eyes of a child again.
user_1;user_1157.jpg;i’ve fallen in love with the taste of stillness lingering in untouched places...drinking in the source of infinite immortality drifting in the silence between my thoughts. saltwater flecked skin cradled in the fingertips of mother earth. dancing through feathers of milky golden light to a sound my ears were once sewn shut to. being alone used to scare me. the isolation was suffocating. for who was i, if i was not pretending to be? once the masks dissolves...what was left underneath? it was not effortless, but pushing past this edge, shattered my self induced walls. over time...solitude has become my medicine. i have become my own best friend. and we go on lots of wild adventures together. undoing. unlearning. unfolding. saying less. listening more. thinking less. living more. doing less. being more.
user_1;user_1158.jpg;back to civilization...here we go again.
user_1;user_1159.jpg;what we consume, we become.
user_1;user_1160.jpg;one afternoon when I was six years old, sitting in the backseat of the car on a road trip to Montana to visit my grandparents, I asked my dad if unicorns were real. he turned to me without hesitation, looked me straight in the eye, and told me that although he had never seen one, if we happened to spot one alongside the road, he would pull over immediately and set me on it’s back for a ride. I spent the rest of the trip with my face pressed against the glass, eyes scanning every inch of the earth whirling past the window. while I didn’t happen to spot one that day, I’ll never forget this moment. I felt like my thoughts mattered. I felt like I mattered. I felt free. while my relationships with my father has never been anywhere close to perfect (is anyone’s honestly), I am immeasurably grateful that I was raised by someone who nurtured my connection to my intuition. I was never once put down for my desires or dreams as a child. I grew up believing everything inside my mind was real. and only now am I beginning to see...that it always was. my current reality is a living reflection of my intuitive nature. my untamed curiosity has breathed life into an eternal childhood dream. this deeply rooted faith has singlehandedly brought me to where i am today. take the time to listen to little kids. let them be your teachers. children are the closest thing to god upon this earth. their minds are medicine for this whole world.
user_1;user_1161.jpg;from the time i was a child, a wound i’ve carried within was the fear of not being enough. not being pretty enough. not being smart enough. not being strong enough. and i still see this wound being reflected in my current reality today. for nearly the past year, i have been paralyzed by a lack of creativity. i have starved myself from expression due to a low sense of self worth. my tendency to distance myself from humans, social media included, stems from this childhood wound. feeling undeserving of love. feeling undeserving of human connection. self love is not something that happens overnight when you spend nearly your entire life wishing you were someone else. over the course of this past year, i have learned to fall in love with being alone. solitude has singlehandedly been one of the most powerful forms of healing i’ve experienced. through over time, my loneliness has begun to eat away at me. human connection is a sacred part of this experience. my soul chose to come here to heal. and i want to help. i want to give back. this is all i’ve ever wanted, from the time i began this account. this platform can be powerful if i chose for it to be. i am so tired of limiting my potential. i no longer want to shrink away from what i’ve created. i am reclaiming my power. my birthright. my love. here and now. i am so sorry if you ever felt as though i took this for granted. i cherish each and every single one of you. we are not alone in anything. and my life is a lot less together than it may appear to be on screen. beneath the surface, we are all going through the same shit. so thank you for your unwavering patience throughout this journey. for being here as i lose myself to find myself. through the rise and fall. through everything. for those of you who are still listening, for those of you who have been here for me since my banana ice cream rants on my back porch, for those of you who see me as more than an image on your screen...these words are for you. thank you. for seeing me, even when i did not see myself. the future is not what it used to be.

user_1;user_1163.jpg;everyone is living their own version of truth. and every truth is true for that being given their current state of evolution. any judgement you project towards anything and everyone is a reflection of a wounding you carry within. for there is no separation between you and anyone. this world is your mirror. you cannot know anyone else’s place in their journey, for it is masked by your own perception of your place. it’s like standing on one side of a mountain covered in trees, and saying it is green, while on the other side waterfalls run down the slope, and someone is saying it is blue. both are true for each individual. this is the state of our world right now. everyone thinks they are right (and they are), but at the same time, everyone thinks that anyone thinks differently than they do are wrong. this is just another layer of illusion we have become bound to. dissolve the veil of duality, and eternity will emerge. for there is only being. presence. emotion. experience. a life that is real for every living creature. no one is right or wrong. nothing is black and white. everything just is.
user_1;user_1164.jpg;as living creatures, we feel all the same. we all collapse. we all cry. we all experience pain. our emotions reawaken our intuitive nature. the fragility of our humanity is what makes this existence sacred. our suffering shatters the illusion of separation in a single touch. it reminds us of who we are. that everything is connected. that we are not alone. as children, this emotional energy flows through us effortlessly. when we are sad, we cry. when we are happy, we laugh. though over time, we are taught to be tamed. self expression becomes bound to societal conditioning. we become numb. cold. unfeeling. cut off from our inner source, we begin to look outside ourselves for the cure to our state of unconscious disease. starving for the love we are unwilling to give ourselves. our collective dehumanization is making us into mindless machines. enslaved to a system sewn by the fingertips of fear. we are living within stories woven through the minds of others, rather than writing our own. you matter. your thoughts, dreams, ideas...everything. it all matters. you know more than you think you do. trust your instincts. chase your curiosity. do not break yourself to fit into a broken society. do not sacrifice your soul for the illusion of security. nothing is safe. nothing is certain. learn to fall in love with letting go. this is how to be free. this is how to remember.
user_1;user_1165.jpg;hi. it’s me. i am love. an infinite source of energy existing in all places, at all times, currently seeking refuge within this 20 year old skin. i am your living reflection. i am not an image. i am not a number. i am not “user_1”. for even this is a label. having this account does not magically grant me immunity to the fragility of this human existence. i still cry and fall apart and feel everything you do. i’ve spent the majority of this past year sharing less than one percent of my life through social media. i am well aware that i have been distant from this platform. i know i tend to disappear from here for weeks or months on end at times. but this time away was the catalyst in healing my connection to myself. stillness became a sacred source of energy which nurtured my inner world. solitude is my medicine. my purpose is not to be liked, accepted, or validated by this external world. my purpose is to heal. there is so much i want to say. to share. to give. i couldn’t manage to fit it all in this tiny little caption, so i sat down today and let my thoughts pour out on video. the link is in my bio. for those of you who are still here, for those of you who are still listening, thank you. your existence is a living source of hope for my own. i love you.
user_1;user_1166.jpg;you know more than you think you do. listen.
user_1;user_1167.jpg;since touching back on native soil, i have barely had the strength to get out of bed. i am emotionally exhausted. depleted deep within. for the last few months, i’ve been caught in a seemingly endless cycle of heightened stimulation. swallowed into a current of ceaseless change and unrelenting chaos, entangled in so deeply in stories and lives belonging to other beings, that the lines began to blur between where i began and they ended. my heightened sensitivity left me feeling like a sponge worn thin. like i absorbed so much of others, i lost touch with my own truth. one week ago, curled up alone in a little air b n b in bali, a wave of homesickness washed over me as saltwater rivers poured from my eyes. i missed walking into a local grocery store and recognizing everyone by name. being wrapped in the arms belonging to dozens of familiar faces. i missed climbing trees and swimming naked in backyard rivers. i missed foraging fresh coconuts from roadside beaches, and losing track of time in a the simplicity of a sanctuary where the most exciting news of the year is if the one lane bridge floods due to heavy rain. i missed gathering herbs from backyard gardens and the warmth of stories spoken over home cooked meals. i missed being barefoot. i missed being free. i missed myself. and i’ve been trying to find my way back to her ever since. sometimes you can only love, what you have lost. i could see how sacred this island, this family, is to me, through letting her go. and i knew it was time. to return.
user_1;user_1168.jpg;i spent the whole day winding through a little beach town attempting not to kill anyone on a scooter. this has been successful so far. stay tuned for updates. traveling solo for the last 30 days has shattered the illusion of isolation i spent nearly my entire life conditioned to be caged within. it has opened me up at my core. i’ve had no cell service. no sense of direction. most days spent wandering aimlessly, rising at dawn. finding a family in the selflessness of strangers who give you a lift to the local market in the pouring rain. who open their arms and homes to you when you have nothing to offer but love in return. i saw god in the eyes of a stray starving kitten today. the sheer magnitude of compassion that surged through me while sharing a meal with this innocent creature was medicine for my soul. you can literally open your heart to any being at any moment if you chose to, you can experience love in everything. everyone. everywhere. divinity lingers in all living creatures. there is nothing lonely about being alone, when you can recognize your reflection in all that surrounds you. this journey has only led me right back to where i began.
user_1;user_1169.jpg;what is love, to you?
user_1;user_1170.jpg;my life probably doesn’t make sense to most people. and that’s okay. but i am learning to walk the thin line between sharing and living. this is a sliver of my story. i don’t want to influence you, i want to empower you. your story matters, too. learn to breathe life into your own.
user_1;user_1171.jpg;currently: spellbound and intoxicated by the sheer beauty of being fully alive.
user_1;user_1172.jpg;unfold.
user_1;user_1173.jpg;march 7th. today, i turned twenty years old. and today, i wrote the first words of my first book. currently engulfed in solitude on a remote island off the northern coast of new zealand, nestled in a little air b n b i booked for four nights. alone. overflowing. free. taming my thoughts through transcendence. tangled in sheets of syllables, making love to language like art. every cell in my body, enveloped in waves of dizzying electricity. the whole world is spinning beneath my feet. i have pierced through a veil blanketing humanity in a sea of unconsciousness. i will no longer neglect this gift i’ve been graced with. it is time. everything has led up to this. here. now. the instinctual thirst to honor my intuition runs through my veins. my voice is a sacred source of medicine. my words will reawaken the intuitive nature of all living creatures upon this earth. hawaii was my prelude. this is my opening chapter. everything has changed. the future is not what it used to be.
user_1;user_1174.jpg;yesterday i flew to the other side of the world with a one way ticket. one backpack. two sneakers. no plan. whatsoever. now i just need to learn how to make friends with humans instead of palm fronds and fit into a modern society in which clothes and shoes are required. wish me luck.
user_1;user_1175.jpg;there is no such thing as “being spiritual.” because we are all spiritual. we are all souls within bodies. reflections of divinity having a human experience within this fragile form of flesh and skin. continually evolving on the endless spiral that composes our existence itself. circling back to the same experiences over and over again, until we heal and grow through them. we are all bruised and messy and beautifully alive. being spiritual doesn’t make you special. if anything, it can make you feel incredibly isolated and alone in this world because you start seeing through everyone’s bullshit. it can even make you feel lost when you start seeing through your own bullshit. when everything is stripped away, what are you left with? who do you become when no one is around? can you love yourself in your purest nature? every single human being is living upon a different earth shaped by their inner veil of perception. i don’t want you to blindly look up to me or adopt my truth as your own. for it has been shaped by my own life. my own losses. my own suffering. my own love. i want you to accept nothing, and question everything. question me. i want you to strip away every layer burying your authenticity until only your rawest form emerges and your darkness is staring you straight in the face. and then i want you to love the shit out all that you are on the unending journey towards unearthing your own inner truth. please don’t look up to me as an image. look into me. not at me. i am a mirror. see me as your living reflection.
user_1;user_1176.jpg;money. the one thing that no one talks about on social media (or ever, really). it consumes our society, our minds, our lives. but is severely avoided in any and all conversations at extreme lengths because it is so damn. controversial. i am 19 years old. and there is no rule book for any of this. my life is messy and a lot less together than it may appear to be. i am fairly sure there isn’t a single logical bone in my body. nearly every decision i make is guided by my heart over my head. one year ago, i left my apartment in los angeles, gave away nearly everything i owned, booked a one way ticket to an island, and never looked back. no plan. no direction. i had little to no financial security at the time. i was selling art prints and hand writing postcards. living month to month from the income i was making just to get by. due to my intuitive nature, i have the tendency to neglect the responsibilities of functioning as a human being within a world governed by numbers. i can’t even remember the last time i glanced at my bank account. for so long, i perceived money as this toxic illusion of security. while most of this world is driven by wealth alone, i am so far on the other end of the spectrum that i forget to take care of myself at times. i still have to pay bills and rent and fill up my car with gas and buy food and do normal human things. for some reason, i have felt guilty about making money for so long. i held it out at arms length, and avoided it seemingly at all costs. yes, i am aware that this is entirely illogical. i am trying to shift my current perception of money. to see it as an exchange of energy. not as something that is inherently toxic and negative. because the truth is, the more you have, the more you can give. for example. if i currently had one million dollars sitting in my bank account i would probably have opened up an animal shelter/healing retreat/started a nonprofit…the list goes on and on. i have so many dreams that could be elevated by a stronger financial foundation, and i no longer want to be caged by these self limiting beliefs. (will be continued on my website, coming soon. xx)
user_1;user_1177.jpg;i can’t wait for the moment you see yourself through my eyes.
user_1;user_1178.jpg;i am claire. michelle is my middle name. it is also my mother’s name, which i inherited after she gave birth to me at home in the midst of a spring snow storm in colorado on march 7, 1998. i hope to be half the badass she is someday. i live in a little beach town nestled along the coastline. no traffic lights. one gas station. a place where people call one another by their first name and being barefoot in grocery stores is socially acceptable. I can’t remember the last time I brushed my hair, wore a bra, or shaved my legs. for the past nine months i drove a car i found on the side of the road whose windows didn’t roll up. at all. and it rains in hawaii. a lot. a few weeks ago, tiny ferns began to grow in my backseat. growing up, i was a severely introverted only child who found a home in books instead of humans. I can count on my fingers the number of people who really know me inside and out. if you are a friend, you are family. when i love, i love relentlessly. fiercely. unapologetically. i am an anorexia survivor. I used to eat under 300 calories a day and not be able to walk up a single flight of stairs without nearly fainting. today, I wake up each morning as the whole world sleeps and run for hours on end. movement is medicine. wounds turn to wildflowers in time. instagram is not who i am. it is a channel for creativity. just because i use weird words and write long captions does not mean i am enlightened or have ascended into some magical fourth dimension. when i was a little girl, all i wanted to be when grew up was pretty. I hated my giraffe limbs and elf nose, my dimple chin and unmanageably thick hair. seventh grade was the loneliest year of my life. the bathroom stalls were my sanctuary from bullies during the day. my mother’s arms were my refuge at night. each day i would come home from school and collapse into her embrace. she would cradle me in her limbs, gently brushing the saltwater spilling through my lashes. soft hazel eyes steadily met my own as she held my face in her fingertips and whispered, “hurt people, hurt people. they are the ones who need your love the most.” now I am grown up, and all I want to do is change this world.
user_1;user_1179.jpg;some humans are so starved for love that they tear into the skin of others for a taste of sugar for a sliver of light but my skin is earth and when you carve wounds into my flesh the mountains will collapse the clouds will exhale oceans and the winds will writhe in agony as this world crumbles to ashes beneath your feet you will be left hungrier than ever hollow and empty for hate is a double edged dagger and by digging your knife into my skin you have shattered the foundation of the only home you live within.
user_1;user_1180.jpg;like liquid gold rising from the dust of my own ashes, i am a living symptom of my suffering. i have known what it is like to have nothing. to feel nothing. to be nothing. only through being swallowed into darkness, did i uncover my inner source of light. this life arose from the roots of my deepest wounds. it was only through surrendering to surging depths of pain that shattered all that i once was, that i could become who i am. who i was placed here to be. suffering is a sacred initiation into unshaken strength. i will no longer bury my broken pieces. for they are what have made me whole. on july 14th, 2016, i left home. $500 dollars to my name. a single backpack resting against my fragile spine. a oneway greyhound bus ticket to los angeles, pressed between trembling fingertips. i was 18 years old. no plan. no direction. and in this concrete jungle, i lost myself. entirely. i had no solid foundation in who i was. i was still caught in the unending cycle of seeking my inner self worth from validation of others. i abandoned my authenticity for a false sense of belonging. i sacrificed my truth and shifted my beliefs to align with those i was surrounded by. and in turn, my physical form began to crumble apart. the further i fell from my truth, the further my soul drifted from my body…until it abandoned this physical vessel entirely. when i looked into the mirror, i no longer recognized the reflection staring back at me. numb. hollow. broken. starving for love. i wanted to belong to another body. i ached to escape my skin. i hated who I was. who I had become. so I self sabotaged. mindlessly binged and binged to feed an emotional hunger deep within. i became heavier, though still felt achingly empty. there were days in which i could hardly crawl out of bed. i nearly got to the brink of death when a burn on my leg turned to a full blown infection in a matter of days. i was forced to take several antibiotics to cure the infection, which i had a severe allergic reaction to. my entire body broke out in hives. but this was the tipping point. this was my wake up call. i knew something was wrong. something needed to shift. so, i let go of everything.
user_1;user_1181.jpg;i found a home within the arms of strangers who turned to family in a matter of seconds. humans who made time for stories spoken over home cooked meals beneath a blanket of stars. who made time for love. i learned that happiness is effortless and gentle. it is the soft flicker of light whispering through roadside fields at dusk. the exhale of a setting sun, bathing our world in liquid gold. the warmth of saltwater flecked skin pressed against mine. the taste of 7 am coffee from food trucks and the selflessness stitched into the hearts of those who carry you for miles in the back of their pick up trucks without asking for anything in return. finding ourselves in lost places. drinking in the wild air whirling through an open window as we traced our way through backyard coastlines. listening to the echo of waves kissing the slumbering sand in endless infatuation. collapsing into bed after scampering barefoot through a living nirvana until the last sliver of light melted beneath crystalline waters. the days dissolved together and time faded from my mind. weeks would pass in which i would hardly glance at my phone. i felt whole. i felt free. I felt infinite. overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of being fully alive. these moments were sacred to me. and i knew they would slip through my fingertips, if i held them out to this world. so i continued to delve deeper within.
user_1;user_1182.jpg;this past year has been by far the most beautiful, yet the most difficult of my entire life. a whirlwind of missteps. of downfalls. of imperfection. i have lived a life held together by threadbare stitches. messy. raw. broken. our existence is composed of duality itself. hot and cold. salt and sugar. light and dark. you need one, to feel the other. so much unfolds beneath the veil of this little screen. through letting go of social media, softening the endless surge of distractions infiltrating the collective consciousness of this external world, i drifted into a sanctuary of stillness. and it was here, I was finally safe to surrender. I was finally safe to collapse. so I did. I shed my skin as darkness tore through me. clawing at flesh and bone as its screams escaped my lips, starving for the taste of air. howled until my limbs were trembling and my lungs were numb. unearthed the emotions I had been burying for years. cried and cried until I was empty inside. watched as the walls I had worked so tirelessly to build shatter to ruins beneath me.everything was stripped away…until I was left with only love. my illusion of self dissolved as eternity emerged at my fingertips. I gazed upon every inch of my being through the eyes of unconditional compassion, and felt as though I was seeing myself for the first time. and gradually, this love grew and grew until others were able to see me, too. through the reawakened fluidity of my borderless heart, I experienced a depth of connection i was unaware existed until i fell head over heels in love with the purity of stillness that arises from living within the eternal embrace of this present moment. connection to myself. connection to others. connection to every living creature upon this earth.
user_1;user_1183.jpg;i know i’ve been distant. i’ve never felt more disconnected from social media than i do right now. it is as if even when i am here, i am not truly here. and for those of you who are still listening, i need to release what has been weighing so heavily on my heart. for the past few months, i’ve felt lost. suffocated by self induced doubt. paralyzed by the illusion of perfection. wrestling with untamed thoughts inside my mind. caught between two worlds. stillness and creativity. constantly torn between tracing inwards, and pouring outwards. giving love to myself. giving love to others. one of the most frequent requests i receive, is to share more. to show more. to make more videos. to take more photos. and for some reason, every time i raise a camera to capture this life, something inside my soul screams not to. initially, i thought that this was because a piece of me still feared vulnerability. as though transparency can only be embodied through exposing my inner world on film. documenting raw moments of my life to dilute the illusion of perfection constructed through social media. and today, it hit me like a tidal wave. my thoughts unraveled as a million droplets of water descended in unison, washing over every fiber of my being. clearing my vision. the truth is, vulnerability is a living expression of creative authenticity. doing what you love. loving what you do. and my purest form of self expression is writing. it always has been. since the time i was a child, and i relentlessly poured my imagination into the faded pages of the little journal that never left my side. words were my refuge. my sanctuary. instagram has never been about images for me. it has been the words. i don’t want to be looked at. i want to be looked into. i want to be listened to. i feel as though i’ve been so caught up in embodying the expectations of others, that i’ve become blind to what’s been in front of my eyes this entire time. all i want to do is write. all i’ve ever wanted to do, is write. i’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to see this. there is so much more i want to say, and i will, as time goes on. thank you for listening to my words. this is just the beginning.
user_1;user_1184.jpg;the forest exhaled softly as her limbs knelt beneath a sky bruised with lilac clouds. drifting through delicate dreams, i watched as a moonrise kingdom rose from the ashes at dusk. lost in the lungs of this living nirvana, i learned to breathe again. xx photo edited with my H O M E collection of presets. gentle illumination blended with natural tones. coming soon. @user_1presets
user_1;user_1185.jpg;from the time i was a child, i felt everything. my skin was like a sponge, soaking in all that surrounded me. i lost myself in the minds of others. became entangled in thoughts and emotions that did not even belong to me. my fluid heart merged and blended with every being i came into contact with. their suffering became my own. their darkness consumed my light. sometimes i felt as though i was carrying this weight of the whole world upon my spine. i was conditioned to see my sensitivity as a weakness, i was fed the lie that to survive in this broken world one must become numb. empty. cold. i played the game for a little while. but the further i buried my emotions, the further i drifted from myself. i know now, that sensitivity is a sacred source of unending strength. the borderless nature of my existence as a child allowed me to glimpse this earth through the eyes of eternity. in every creature, i saw myself. a living reflection of love that composed the very fiber of my being. so i knelt before the innocent. the wounded. the broken. i became a voice for the voiceless as forests shattered arounds and mountains collapsed. i screamed until my lungs were starving for the taste of air, and the tears of clouds painted rivers into my skin. there is beauty lingering in destruction. in remaining soft in this rigid world. for though the darkness of others becomes your own, so does their light. so feel. feel it all. feel everything. embrace vulnerability so that your edges may crumble and your walls may shatter. rise in the illumination of your inner flames as they dissolve the illusion of isolation and turn your cage to ashes. expand and expand and grow and grow until you embody the essence of eternity. i have been beautifully broken. but i am still breathing. i still rise.
user_1;user_1186.jpg;the essence of our existence is fluid by nature. as humans, we are in a constant state of evolution. ever shifting. growing. becoming. effortlessly reborn within the eternal embrace of each present moment. though within our society, we are conditioned to resist change and uncertainty, we are taught to sacrifice our souls through becoming enslaved to the illusion of security. all that i know for sure, is that nothing beautiful arises from what is easy or safe. up until today, my life has been composed of a million little blind leaps of faith. i have learned to chase my curiosity and fall in love my fears, for freedom lingers at their edge. i will be embarking on a new chapter in life soon, but before i do, i wanted to create something that would embody the indescribable connection i have to hawaii. my home. this world between worlds. a living refuge between heaven and earth, cradled in the waves of a crystalline sea. for the past few weeks, i’ve been pouring every ounce of my heart + soul into this project. it’s roots have grown beneath my surface for so long...and i am so excited to finally share this, with you. i am currently designing a new collection of presets. called “home.” through painting images with the colors of my imagination, breathing life into hues and light, i’ve infused the nostalgic energy of this island into each preset i’ve created. it is my hope that they may illuminate the beauty and strengthen your connection to own home, wherever on earth you may be. this home reconnected me to my roots. though i know this connection only arose through nurturing the light within myself first. this reawakened illumination gradually grew and expanded until it became a living reflection in all that surrounded me. we are each on a journey of becoming that which we already are. so i became my own sanctuary. i became my own home. because in the end, home isn’t a place. it’s a feeling. it is love. ps: follow @user_1presets for little sneak peaks + updates on my collection launch ✨🦋🌟
user_1;user_1187.jpg;love filled lungs.
user_1;user_1188.jpg;the moment your hand wrapped its way around my own, i cradled the warmth of a thousand stars in my fingertips. like a wave washing over a coastline, your light was soft and gentle. it stirred my soul from her slumber as it whispered beneath my skin. reawakened the curiosity that once composed every fiber of my being. stitched wings upon the spine of the little girl buried inside of me. the one who nearly wilted beneath the weight of this world. your untamed imagination nurtured the rebirth of my inner child. crystalline carved my veins as i shed my skin and rose through a womb of celestial grace. followed the illumination of your footsteps to the edge of this earth, gathered my feathers, and free fell. drifted into the arms of infinity as we retraced our roots. swam through lavender clouds and danced barefoot in lullaby rain. climbed the slender limbs of coco trees as the sun blanketed our skin in liquid gold. lost in an inner nirvana, we returned to our origins. a new earth emerged before my eyes as as i glimpsed eternity through your own. a mind free from fear, you see your reflection in every trace of beauty that surrounds you. the little grains of sand clinging to your skin are no less than the milky galaxies lingering in the indigo sky above. the lungs of the forests and rivers exhale the same sound of eternity. and this is the purest form of freedom. effortless interconnection with the sacred source of love running through all living creatures. the rhythm of unspoken unity. rising and falling with each breath you take, as your sleepy head rests against my chest. in your soul, we are one. in your eyes, i found myself.
user_1;user_1189.jpg;i am what you may call a severely unbalanced human. entirely all or nothing. i will never post just to post. i will never create out of obligation. i value you more than that. i value myself more than that. social media has gradually become saturated with surface level content in a world achingly hungry for depth. i will only ever share, write, or if i feel inspired to. and for the past few weeks, i’ve hardly glanced at my phone. through letting go of social media for a little while, breaking away from the surge of information constantly infiltrating our consciousness, i reconnected with the unending source of creativity that lingers in the silence of my own mind. in mindlessly consuming the thoughts of this world, how can you unearth your own truth? i believe that the purest form of authentic expression arises in stillness. i drifted away from instagram to pour every ounce of my energy into a childhood film that has been in the making for months now. many sleepless nights later, fueled by coffee and passion alone...it is finally finished. my perfectionist tendencies cause me to be incredibly hard on myself in all i create and do, but i can honestly say that this movie is the most beautiful work of art i have ever breathed life into. it embodies reawakened innocence, ethereal love in human form. raw. real. whole. as i am. as you are. i can’t wait to share this piece of my soul, with yours.
user_1;user_1190.jpg;i carry this home within.
user_1;user_1191.jpg;the sound of your soul echoes softly beneath my skin. a whisper in the wind, breathing air into the living symptom of an unforgettably beautiful memory. like being cradled weightlessly in the lungs of a gentle hurricane, these collapsing waves stir my wounds until they turn to wildflowers. i see the illumination flickering in the depths of your fragile heart, a flame burning softly at the edge of this world...your warmth calls me home.
user_1;user_1192.jpg;and one day, the whole world fit inside my arms.
user_1;user_1193.jpg;i was the girl who would wake up at 2 am, skin trembling with chills. who would grasp the sheets and attempt to pull them tighter around what i had become. a collection of fragile bones and lucid fears. a living symptom of sleepless nights, starved by the demons that lingered in the depths of my mind. i was the girl who would take two bites of food on her plate and claim she was full as she pushed it aside. the girl who longed to belong to another body. who would pull at her flesh in every mirror she walked past, desperately praying she could somehow escape the skin she was born within. i was the girl who became so small, i nearly vanished into thin air. this girl died in my arms today. i was on a run. the cool air swirling around me as i descended the slope of a road encircling the mountains near my house. i glanced at my feet, drumming against the earth below, and stopped suddenly. the whole world seemed to slow around me, as i gazed down at my body. i felt as if i was seeing myself for the first time. my bare toes, my lanky limbs, painted with bruises and scars, stories etched into freckled skin. i traced my fingertips across my face, absorbing the composure of my cheekbones, the tip of my elvish nose, feeling the warmth of my breath spilling softly from my lips. an ocean of unending acceptance washed over me for all that i am. i wrapped my arms around myself, and spoke through saltwater rivers running steadily from my eyes. “i love you. i’m sorry. please forgive me.” i was sobbing. repeating the words over and over until they were burned into my brain. after years of being consumed by self hatred, my legs still carried me. air still filled my lungs. my heart still beat inside my chest. my body kept me alive, without me even asking it to. and if this isn’t the purest form of unconditional love, i’m not sure what is. and in that moment, holding myself on that dirt road, the little girl who became nothing, turned to ashes in my fingertips. i raised my hands to the sky, and watched as the wind reached down to gently lift her from my grasp, carrying her broken pieces until she dissolved into the pale blue sky. and i felt like i was finally coming home.
user_1;user_1194.jpg;this universe sustains all creatures in alignment with their purest form. this earth does not seek to be anything other than what she is. the effortless perfection and unimaginable beauty of our natural world is a symptom of surrender, sourced through the universal thread of interconnection that flows through all living beings. every aspect of creation is given all that it needs to be fulfilled here on earth. the slender limbs of an oak tree, steadily reaching out to cradle the sky. the fragile yet agile wings of a bee, carrying its body delicately as it dances from flower to flower. the blades of grass flecked softly with morning dew. the curvature of a wave as it collapses within itself. the thunderstorm lullabies echoing through emerald mountains at dusk. no one watches a rain drop fall upon the earth and says, “oh, that could have been better. that raindrop should fly back into its cloud and try again.” but why are we so cruel and harsh with ourselves? like nature itself, this purpose is to simply be. just as you are. here and now. we were each placed here with a purpose. a dream. a gift, only we can give. this is the cure. do not rely upon the limited comprehension of a mind conditioned to be comforted by the cage of certainty. do not sacrifice this dream that stirs the depths of your soul, for the illusion of security. follow your fears to the freedom that lingers on the edge of rationality and spontaneity. unapologetically pursuing this passion, relentlessly honoring your intuition is the most selfless gift you can offer this world. there is nothing dignified about burying your beauty, your infinite potential, as to fit into a broken world. the elevation of your existence into its highest essence will illuminate the paths of countless souls, and guide us along the path of universal interconnection towards the collective remembrance of our origins. listen to the stillness lingering within the depths of your sacred heart. let their gentle whispers guide you home. the way out, is within.
user_1;user_1195.jpg;this morning, a new earth emerged at my fingertips. i watched as dawn gently gathered the stars lingering in a pale indigo sky and slipped the moon beneath her sheets. i listened as the waves softly kissed backyard coastlines and coco trees unfolded their limbs to cradle the sun. fairies and finches stretched their wings in the flickering light drifting through wisps of clouds suspended in the air swirling above a living nirvana. this little sliver of neverland, lost in a crystalline sea. i drank in the taste of saltwater as the sound of stillness filled my lungs and northern winds wove whispers beneath bare skin. the crickets exhaled one last lullaby as the forests were bathed in liquid gold. i woke up with the whole world wrapped around me, and still somehow felt weightless in its grasp.
