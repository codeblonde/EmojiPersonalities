user_26;user_260.jpg;Winner winner tofu steak dinner! Plus a lil fried rice situ 😋 The tofu steaks were just made from extra firm tofu blocks which I sliced thick, scored, then marinated with soy sauce, vegan fish sauce, minced ginger and garlic and baked. Nothing spesh but simple and nourishing! ✨ OH OH OH we are finally mooooving!!! (We’ve been staying at Will’s fam home since we got back from Mexico 🏡) Excited to finally be in my own kitchen space 😆🙏🏼 (it’s SUPER DUPER pink.. think grey-pink 😅 which I’m not the biggest fan of) but HEY! There’s a GAS stove and an oven and running water and honestly I am grateful we have found a place 👍🏼 Things are a little chaotic at the moment - also working on that mental health atm - so not much time to cook until we get settled, but dooo stay tuned 🥰 Can’t wait to show y’all the new kitchen!!
user_26;user_261.jpg;I won’t be posting any cooking this week. I’ve been struggling to find what the right thing to say is. I still don’t exactly know. But like so many of us, I am outraged by the murder of George Floyd. Of Eric Garner. Of Janet Wilson. Of Breonna Taylor. Of Ezell Ford. Black Americans who have died at the hands of the Police. So I’m saying something instead of nothing. Sitting all the way over here in Australia may feel far from the protests, but even here is there so much more I can and need to do. ⁣Racism is alive here too. In Australia in 2015, David Dungay, a 26-year-old Indigenous Australian was held down by officers so hard that he died while begging for his life. His family are yet to see any justice. This is not a one-off case either. It’s uncomfortable, but we need to sit with our discomfort and question it. Some of the things I do are probably supporting white-supremacy in ways I don’t even know. I’ll be actively working to unpack that this week and forever more. ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ I’m educating myself this week with anti-racist works and ask you to do the same. I will be sharing some of these resources in my stories. “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.” - Martin Luther King⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ No matter where we may be in the world, we can become better allies to the black community. Teach your kids about racism. Change your beauty standards. Confront racial injustices even when it makes you uncomfortable, especially with family or friends. Do you follow mostly white influencers, authors, artists, speakers etc? Broaden who you are influenced by - follow more Black leaders. ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #JusticeForAhmaud #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #JusticeForEricGarner #JusticeForEzellFord
user_26;user_262.jpg;More GFSD pero con seeds ✨ #weakcaptionsoz
user_26;user_263.jpg;HOLLANDAISE! A sauce I loved in my pre-vegan days for it’s simplicity. ✨ No obvious flavours, but a deliciously lip-smackin’ balance of buttery, tangy, fatty goodness. 😋 I tried to capture that in my version of a vegan holly so you won’t find any loud garlic or onion flavours here (as good as garlic and onion powders are!!) - just a vegan version of this classic sauce, just as simple and subtle! Recipe saved highlights and on the blog (user_26.com) - recipe on blog is for Vegan Eggs Benedict! 👌🏼
user_26;user_264.jpg;VEGAN TWIX!! 😱😱😱 from the dessert wizards are @wearenutie! 🍩 It’s also gluten-free!!??? (deeply sorry to everyone who doesn’t live in Sydney 😅) I honestly didn’t expect the caramel to STRING LIKE THAT. Caught me off guard in a good way. But got chocolate on my shirt. Worth it tho. Daaaaamn, nutie!
user_26;user_265.jpg;Curry Noodle Soup with Crispy Potatoes! 🥔🍜 Believe me when I say THE CRISPY POTATOES ARE SO GOOD ON DIS. Try it try it try it DO NOT DENY IT 💁🏻‍♀️ Recipe on website and also saved in highlights! 👌🏼
user_26;user_266.jpg;Today’s gluten-free sourdough: for some friends to taste test! 🥰 I‘m finding that the GF-sourdough is surprisingly super tasty. While it doesn’t have delisssh rye flavour, it’s super nutty and mellow. ✨ I ground some of the flours right before I mixed the dough and I think it makes a huge difference! 😋🌾
user_26;user_267.jpg;Lunch was a BANGER!! 🤙🏼Spinach and Artichoke Casserole with White Beans a la Caitlin @frommybowl was 😙👌🏼!!! SO cosy, easy, filling and delicious! HIGHLY recommend! 🤤 We gobbled it UP with many a slice of homemade gf sourdough slathered with vegan butter. A perfect autumn meal. 🍁🍂 Any recs for easy dump-and-bake type meals? I’m a convert 🙋🏻‍♀️
user_26;user_268.jpg;MY FIRST GLUTEN FREE SOURDOUGH. NOT BAD. GOOD SIZE. 🥖🍞
user_26;user_269.jpg;DELI REUBEN, BUT MAKE IT VEGAN!!! ⚠️ Pastrami from @plantedandco, kraut from @gagasforguthealth, pickles and russian dressing on homemade seedy sourdough for a wicked #VeganReuben 👌🏼✨
user_26;user_2610.jpg;Not sure if I love making sourdough or sourdough-discard things more 🤔 Anyone have any great discard recipes they’ve whipped up recently? Please please please share wit me belowww! 🤗 Already on my list of to do are: chocolate cake, crumpets and banana bread! This was a no-knead overnight SD focaccia I threw together last week (nothing special but also everything with discard feels special)!
user_26;user_2611.jpg;My last 8 posts have been brown/beige/yellow foods... and if you thought it was time for a more colourful post, YOU’D BE WRONG! 🙆🏻‍♀️ Pasta for lunch today!
user_26;user_2612.jpg;Mayak kimbap straight up reminds me of Gwangjang Market in Seoul, South Korea 🇰🇷 Behind almost every single stall in the main food section of this market are ladies rolling trays on trays on trays of ridiculously delicious mayak kimbap and slathering them in sesame oil and sesame seeds.... but also whilst cooking tteokbokki and preparing banchan and mixing bibimbap! #multitasking These women are in the ZONE and they run the entire food market, whipping up traditional Korean eats. It was amazing to see. 👌🏼Gwangjang was of the best food markets I’ve ever visited in my life and a real highlight of our Korea/Japan trip last year! I was so surprised to find that majority, if not all of the kimbap, here was vegan. (Not so at Myeongdong, which is another famous street food market with a more modern vibe). Today I made some and it was a good time! 😋 Instructions saved in highlights now! They are easy and so delicious - I did cucumber and kimchi (from @gagas)! Don’t forget to use pure sesame oil + toasted sesame to reeeeally make it kimbap. First photo is homemade - rest are lil snippets of magic from Gwangjang. Full #VeganInKorea video(s!) on YouTube if anyone is keen to make themselves HUNGRY.
user_26;user_2613.jpg;Never a bad night for hot Creamy Mushroom Stroganoff! This strog legit tastes like it’s got sour cream in it and it’s súper súper *chef’s kiss*!! 😙👌🏼✨ Creamy, hearty and just perf as the days get colder and colder! 🥶 Only realised recently that stroganoff is actually Russian...so it’s stroganov?! Seems obvious now 💁🏻‍♀️🧐 Anyhoo - recipe is on ze website!
user_26;user_2614.jpg;If you can’t beat em…. join em! 😛 Officially on that ISO sourdough train! 🚂 This morning I pulled the lid off my cast iron pot for the first time - not baaaaad!! Even had some cute lil ears! I was chuffed. Spent a week mucking around with strengthening my starter and doing a lot of research, and it was well worth it. I’m not a pro (maybe one day though 😉), so not sharing process in stories, but this first loaf has given me the confidence to keep going! Can DEFINITELY recommend doing research first - take notes! Many notes! Watch videos! Read blogs! Make bread! Eat carbs!!!!!!
user_26;user_2615.jpg;Thissa fab dip! She’s a Baked Creamy Artichoke and Spinach situ. Recipe now on the blog. This dip is in existence because I made these fab sourdough crackers using ze @bonappetitmag discard cracker recipe. (Recipe in their highlights!) They’re magic and disappear. Real fast. Make this combo and have a goooood weeekend!
user_26;user_2616.jpg;Get rid of your frownie, make this brownieeeeee! 🤸🏻‍♀️🍫 Starting the weekend RIGHT! Also pumped I got a photo of this coz the sun goes down at 5pm now (?!?!) and I don’t use a proper camera coz I dunno how/am to lazy to learn 🙃 so yay for that!
user_26;user_2617.jpg;This maaaay look level 10 spicy but I think it’s really only like a level 6 spicy. 💁🏻‍♀️ Plus you can make it level 4 spicy or if you reeeeally want to, you could bring it down to a level 0 spice and it’d still be delish. What is it? It’s crispy and chewy Korean rice cakes (tteok!) and tofu smothered in a delectably dangerous-lookin’ red sauce. (But remember the thing we said about the spice levels? YOU are in control, baby 💆🏻‍♀️) Recipe in bio and in highlights! 💛✨
user_26;user_2618.jpg;VEGAN EGGS BENEDICT!!! ⚠️ MYAMYAMYAMYAM! 😋 Aaah I made this today and it was everything I have ever wanted and moreeeee 👌🏼 The hollandaise is GAH. So good. Buttery and subtle and very hollandaise-esque. But vegan. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Oh. You can make it too. Recipe is on ze blog, link in bio 💛✨
user_26;user_2619.jpg;A lemon lover’s dream! ✨ Lemon Raspberry Polenta Cake using @domestic_gothess’ recipe! Original recipe is blueberry but I switched it up for rasps! It’s a super easy bake and absolutely delicious 😋! If you’re looking for something to bake this week - totally recommend this! 😙👌🏼
user_26;user_2620.jpg;Happy Sunday, y’all! 🌞 Getting some sol on ya skin (especially when it’s a cold) makes you feel 🕺🏻Likewise, getting some boba in your tum also makes you feel 🕺🏻
user_26;user_2621.jpg;Happy weekend!! ✨💛 Having a chill weekend eating leftovers, seeing my fam and going on bushwalks! Hope your weekend is going well - take it easy!🕺🏻 Winter is creeeeepin’ in and we’ve had a few very very chilli days here in Sydney! Threw together this vegan KFC plate yesterday as you may have seen in my stories and it was a fun time! 😋 Cauliflower, shimeji and oyster mushroom ‘original recipe chicken’. I still can’t believe how easy it is to find the list of 11 ‘secret’ herbs and spices hahaha. Didn’t quite taste as KFC-ish as I remember (I mean I was using cauliflower and mushroom), but the overall effect was still very impressive! 😱 Would LOVE to have a go with seitan or even tofu sometime...in the distant future - this was HARD WORK 😂😅. Tapped it out on the blog if you want to have a go at it anyway! HAPPY WEEKEND! #VeganKFC
user_26;user_2622.jpg;What a SPREAD this was!! 🤤Our incredibly delicious dinner from a few nights ago! I ordered a few things from the fantastic folks at @plantkitchen.co and Saag Tofu was one of them! 💛 Also this giant chickpea samosa (also from PKC) was truly giant!! To complete the spread I made some Indian-style falafel with freshly picked curry leaves from our family garden (recipe in highlights) and they went perfectly with the tangy and sweet tamarind chutney from @indianfritterie 😋
user_26;user_2623.jpg;Cosy rainy day lunch ☔️ Sun-dried Tomato and Mushroom Polenta Bake slathered in a good amount of garlicky green dill sauce (recipes for both on blog!), salad, @gagasforguthealth kimchi and pickles! 😋✨🌱 YOOOM.
user_26;user_2624.jpg;Just popped up the recipe for this EASY VEGAN FOLDED BREKKY EGG! 🌱🍳 It’s a chickpea and tofu situation and it’s YUM. I seen y’all in the US with your fancy Just Egg errday and I AM SRSLI JEALOUS. 😩 It’s probably not coming to Australia for another 50 years (we pretty much just got Gardein, bless) SOOOOO I made my own 😛 Got that eggy ‘bounce’ which I love. If you want extra egginess, add black salt and you will literally be in eggy heaven. 🙏🏼 But also if you don’t have it, no sweat! Can be hard to find - look at your local Indian grocer if there’s one near you. Otherwise regular salt is 👌🏼👌🏼 Eggies are real good wedged between English muffies with a sausage patty!🕺🏻MIAM! #VeganEgg
user_26;user_2625.jpg;Cute buns from cute parents! 👨🏻👩🏻💛 Mum and Dad made SO MANY BAO omg. I gobbled up 4 as soon as I stepped into the house while picking up some supplies and herbs this morning and they were YUM - filled with mushroom, cabbage, carrot, noodles and ginger 😋 Very simple but so gooood! If you’re looking for a bao dough recipe, there’s one on my blog from when I made vegan BBQ pork buns! Fill with whatever you like!🕺🏻
user_26;user_2626.jpg;Someone please enlighten me. WHY do Brussels sprouts get such a bad rap? 🤷🏻‍♀️ They are literally unreasonably delicious.
user_26;user_2627.jpg;BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. 🙏🏼 Best flavour of pancakes. Or maybe lemon blueberry. 🤔 If you have been searching high and low for the recipe for these, I’m sorry to say they came from the bestest ever GF pancake mix that we bought in Mexico. All I do is stick blueberries into them 🤷🏻‍♀️ They’re SO GOOD and I’m pretty sure there’s only one good batch left so SOOOOON, I’ll be forced to try and recreate the mix after. Stay tuned for when these pancakes run out I guess 🤪
user_26;user_2628.jpg;My dad is the condiment King. (No joke his name is literally King 👑 ). He’s so good at getting flavours BANG ON in asian sauces and lil sides and pickles and other tasty fermented morsel-thangs. GAH. The most frustrating thing is that he eyeballs EVERYTHING so it’s so hard to get a recipe out of the man. 😅 Can only really learn by watching and of course, TASTING. 😋Here we have (clockwise) chinese quick-pickled garlic-cucumbers (I call them quickles), some sorta fermented chilli + shallot + sesame + extra chilli oil BONANZA, a fermented soy bean (natto) ‘salad’, and an Indonesian gado gado peanut sauce. And they’re all fkn fantastic. 😋
user_26;user_2629.jpg;Thank you past-Liz for making a new batch of these cookies last night 🕺🏻

OOFT. #vegan

user_26;user_2633.jpg;Managed to get a hold of some tteok! (Korean rice cakes!) what a TREAT! 😋 Whipped up my favourite way to eat them: tteokkochi! 🔥Think texture PARTY - it’s crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! Not as spicy as you might think, and very delish.
user_26;user_2634.jpg;LIFE IS HARD, EAT A CARB!! But also eat carbs when life isn’t hard because it’s crucial for brain function and energy. Just eat carbs all the time! 🍝⚡️😁 ⁣ -⁣ Cauliflower, Mushroom and Lentil ..... Creamy... Bolognese...ish?! I don’t know what to call this haha 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ (Sorry Italians, i know it ain’t bolognese but it’s the easiest way to describe what’s goin onnnn y’kna?) Anyway! CAN CONFIRM IT’S DELICIOUS. I had it with rigatoni and hit it with some cashew parm and OOH LA LA! 😙✨ ...maybe ‘Pasta Ooh la la’ is a good name? 🤔 Recipe for this bby is on da blog, applications for new name for this delish mess now open. #vegan

user_26;user_2636.jpg;Didn’t like chocolate until I became vegan. True story. 🍫 (I still believe vanilla and strawberry are superior flavours of ice cream/milk, sorry! 😈) But chocolate covered dates (filled with PB!!) are pretty magical ⚡️
user_26;user_2637.jpg;Noodle-slurpasana 🧘🏽‍♀️ One day when this is all over, this pose will return to my regular practice at all Sydney vegan noodle studios 😏🙏🏼✨ #pranayumma

user_26;user_2641.jpg;SHEPHERD’S PIE (AGAIN)! ✨ Made the shepps/cottage pie again and it was WILD 🙌🏼 The mince is TVP which always surprises me with its RIDICULOUS protein amount (over 52g per 100g LIKE WTF), but moreover, never ceases to impress meat-eaters with its very convincing mincey texture. Also stores for ages dry in the pantry. It’s just too good. Anywayyyy i added a lil extra potato and herbs this time too - rosemary on top is *chefs kiss* 😙😙 can recommend but no sweat if you don’t got! Recipe on website! Don’t forget the garlic! 🙃

user_26;user_2647.jpg;MY NO.1 CRAVING 😭🍜💥THESE FAT JUICY SPICY BIANG BIANG NOODS from @XIANEATERY! Best in Sydney - IDGAF what anyone else says. Head chef is from the Shanxi province and SHE IS A BOSS LADY. The noodle QUEEN. She makes THE BEST LIANG PI around (signature cold noodles drowned in some magical chilli oil and vinegar situation). I’m currently at Will’s in self-quarantine and not in the delivery area. 😩 Please support this fabulous family! May I suggest ordering the signature BB noods or the Spinach noods ⚠️ FOR VEGAN: be sure to ask for no meat, no egg ✨ The signature cold noodles are automatically vegan, served with those excellent spongey gluten chunks OOFT👌🏼🙏🏼
user_26;user_2648.jpg;SWEET POTATO GNOCCHI? GUMMY BEARS IN SPACE? 🤷🏻‍♀️ YOU DECIDE! Choose your own adventure, I say. Well, here’s whatever-it-is, in the same delish sweet potato sauce from last night, topped with crispy oyster mushrooms. Wrote it all up good n proper and recipe’s on the blog now! Got enough of those damn peppers left so we might just keep having this 😅😅 Gnocchi recipe by the lovely @veganbyeden - go spy on her delicious foods!👌🏼 #YamsOnYams #YammyYams

user_26;user_2652.jpg;I used to dislike most mochi until we went to Japan. In fact, I still didn’t love it until halfway through I RANDOMLY had a craving for mochi. 🤷🏻‍♀️ NEKK MINNIT we eatin’ mochi for arvo tea every single FLIPPIN’ day until we leave the country. 🍡 Chewy, sticky, rice dumplings, usually filled with red bean! Can be weird at first but I trust everyone will be captured by its simplicity and fun texture in their own time. 👌🏼 Also it’s super super easy to make. Scroll down my feed to a SUPER DUPER PURPLE mochi for the recipe! 💜
user_26;user_2653.jpg;THIS ONE TIME AT SCOUT CAMP I saw our scout leader put fruit chutney into the cottage pie and little-me was like 🤯 WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DO THAT, DAVE? (... I mean... it’s got raisins in it!!) But as I soon found out, and will remember forevermore, it makes really REALLY good pie. (The dankest.) 🙏🏼 Am currently without fruit chutney in this self-quarantining existence, but I raided the pantry and found some onion jam which proved a very worthy substitute! Can recommend. Recipe on the blog, link in B. #StayInYourCottagePie #ThanksDave #FruitChutney

user_26;user_2655.jpg;Just 2 weeks ago we were in Mexico getting snorkel tans and eating every single vegan taco we came across! 🤪Never really experienced real Mexican food before and MY GOSH it was mind-blowing and SO vegan-friendly! Vids coming soon! Apart from food, my favourite parts of the trip were: getting to practice Spanish everyday, visiting the ridiculously phenomenal Pyramids of Chichén-Itzá and Teotihuacán, learning about Mexico’s crazy magnificent history and of course, the brilliant PEOPLE of Mexico. So sad we had to cut our trip short but grateful to be home safe and healthy 💛✨

user_26;user_2665.jpg;My favourite way to eat korean rice cakes: #tteokkochi! The red may seem a bit scary but they’re defs more of a 😅 than a 🥵 kinda spicy. I lurrrve how the CRISSPY contrasts with the sticky of the sauce and the chewy of the rice cake. Crispy is something you don’t really get in any other preparation of tteok (korean rice cakes). Recipe continues to live happily on the blog (user_26.com) and on YT if anyone is interested! 🍡🔥

user_26;user_2667.jpg;BYE INSTAGRAM 👋🏼 ⁣ Hi friends! I will be taking a break from this account. No set time-period, just as long as I feel. I’m not going to go into detail but I have a lot of growing to do. 🌳 I love this platform for so many reasons but right now I just feel a little unhealthy. Optimum health isn’t just looking healthy on Instagram. 🙃 Thanks @drnikkistamp for that.⁣ -⁣ As you may already know, I’ll be attending the @ecowarriorretreats in Costa Rice in March 2020 to learn more about permaculture, regeneration and sustainable living. It will probably be the last one if you want to join, please do!!! It will be an invaluable experience. Not sure if I will be back before then so just sharing now! 💁🏻‍♀️⁣ -⁣ I’ll still be making some videos on YouTube (loudnoodle) and active at @mylkandbun during market periods only. If you need to contact me, you can reach me via email 📧 Please do not contact me via @mylkandbun unless it’s bun related 🙈 ⁣ -⁣ Thank you so much for the support and following along. Looking forward to sharing more in the future! 😙 An early Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all you lovely humans. Be kind and eat more plants ❤️ Liz

user_26;user_2673.jpg;BEST VEGAN RAMEN IN TOKYO 🍜 8 vegan ramen shops later🤰🏻and this fine bowl of noods from Gotsubo/SHAKA is officially my pick the title! #SorryItsNotTsTanTan ⁣ -⁣ It’s curry ramen but not so curry that it’s no longer ramen, if you know what I mean! 💁🏻‍♀️She’s fragrant and spicy in all the right ways. 😙 Broth is not too umami, not under-seasoned, not too creamy, but not just salty water either. Noodles are 👌🏼 in texture. If you’re in town, be sure to slurp this one down! Hopefully you’ll see what I mean 😜🇯🇵 (PS. you want to choose the ¥870 one! ...PPS. Yes it’s really only ¥870.)
user_26;user_2674.jpg;Getting my slerrrps on this week 🍜 Best vegan ramen in Tokyo where are youuuuu? 😲
user_26;user_2675.jpg;Another of my favourite places in Tokyo 🌟 A tiny space and total gem of a restaurant called Gopinatha’s run entirely by one lady 👩🏻‍🍳 Theres about 5 bar seats and two smaller tables for two. The only thing on the menu is a set meal which changes daily depending on what produce she’s picked up 🍆🥬🥕 Everything is made from scratch - so simple but crazy delicious!!
user_26;user_2676.jpg;A street food highlight for me: Taiyaki from Taiyaki Wakaba! 🐟 #Taiyaki are kinda like filled-waffles, traditionally filled with red bean paste called anko, but now other popular fillings include sweet potato, pumpkin, chestnut or even custard! Taiyaki is not usually vegan so this is a double score. 🥳 At Wakaba they only do an anko filling. The taiyaki are cooked in moulds which are filled individually and then cooked over charcoal. In the video, you can see them testing if the taiyaki is cooked by opening the moulds - if it falls out, it’s done! Also love the ventilation situ haha. Just get rid of the whole window, why not!!? 😝⁣ -⁣ Found this awesome gem on @soy4life_jp’s account! Following vegans in Japan (and Korea) has been the best way to the best eats! ⁣ #vegantokyo #veganjapan #ビーガン
user_26;user_2677.jpg;My fave place in Tokyo so far: Nagi Shokudo! 🇯🇵 No frills, just delicious and nourishing vegan food at a good price 👍🏼 I highly recommend the set-lunch, you can choose the three main components! I had the fried soy meat with chilli sauce, eggplant and tofu in a tomatoey sauce (tasted like South Indian tomato chutney for reallll) and okra and capsicum. #NagiShokudo #VeganInTokyo #VeganInJapan
user_26;user_2678.jpg;AIN’T GOT TIME FOR RULES IN TOKYO! 💁🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️If you’re wondering what the rule was, it was to only eat Japanese food...but ALAS, here I am eating blue ice cream, falafel and smashing burgers! 🕺🏻 Too much good food in this city! I also love the commitment by a lot of restaurants (at least a lot of vegan ones) to using organic and macrobiotic ingredients! Very refreshing 🌿 #GoodBuy #VeganInTokyo #VeganTokyo
user_26;user_2679.jpg;So the vegan set meals in Kyoto were totally nuts! ✨🌟 ⛩ I don’t think I appreciated the attention to detail enough at the time! Here are the 5 best set-meals we chowed down on in Japan’s former Capital: ⁣ 🍱 (BEST) Yubanzai Komameya Nishiki - A traditional and special Yuba feast which had yuba or tofu in every element - lots of unique textures and flavours. You need your ask for vegetarian and then specify no milk, egg, cream, dashi. ⁣ 🍱 Vegan Cooking Arashiyama-kan Tofu and Vegetables - a very kind elderly man owns this restaurant and was super passionate about telling us about the preparation of all the dishes and the ingredients! Too delicious! ⁣ 🍱 Hale Vegetarian (they also serve some seafood here) - a total gem hidden through a small door at Nishiki Market. Amazing yuba and rice dish! ⁣ 🍱 Onwa (in Nara) - the sweetest little eatery in what feels like a tiny house? Add rice balls to your set meal if you’re hungry! There was GF apple pie baking for our whole visit and we had some before we left. Try the matcha ice cream too. So good. ⁣ 🍱 Itadakizen - I think this is a chain (?) but didn’t feel like it at all. The food was amazing! ⁣ #VeganInKyoto #Kyoto
user_26;user_2680.jpg;So good 🌸🇯🇵
user_26;user_2681.jpg;I told myself I was only going to eat Japanese food in Japan... but there are so many vegan burgies, surely it’d be rude not to! 😉 I used to lurrrve fish burgers and both of these are indeed vegan fish burgies. The first one from Morpho Cafe was amazing - the texture of the fish wasn’t actually too fishy but it worked out real good as a whole - this was the better burger. The 2nd one from Ain Soph had DA BEST vegan tartare (and a lot of it 😛) but the patty was a tad too oily even for me and I struggled to finish it 😅
user_26;user_2682.jpg;A very unique Inari sushi from Senbon Inari at Fushimi Inari station 🤗 FUN INARI FACTS: If you go to Fushimi Inari shrine, you’ll see hundreds of fox statues! 🦊 🦊 It’s the shrine dedicated to Shinto, the god of rice, and foxes are said to be the messengers at Inari that supposedly love eating fried tofu pockets! They’re either shaped as rectangles to represent rice bags offered at the shrine, or triangles to represent a foxes ear! ⁣ -⁣ At Senbon Inari, the tofu isn’t as bubbly as regular Inari which is usually made from deep fried tofu pockets called #aburaage tofu. More tofu flavour and inside is seasoned with what I thiiiink was maybe yuzu?! Had a yum tangy citrus feel going on. 🍋 They have two vegan options that you can get (they have a very clear allergen list in English!) 😋 Inari is definitely one of my fave types of sushi!
user_26;user_2683.jpg;Day trip to Nara today! 🦌 Dawdled with some deer, walked past that super famous mochi shop and visited @onwa_cafe for these stunning (in taste and looks!) plates of local produce 🥕 Chased lunch with some ice cream and a freshly baked tart and it was 👌🏼 Stressed a few days ago over gettin’ work done while here but then I remembered to just live in the now and enjoy everything around me 🤗 So just takin’ it eeeeasy while we’re here ❤️🇯🇵 Japan is swell!
user_26;user_2684.jpg;As much as I love eating out, there is nothing quite like a home-cooked meal 🏠 It’s been a while! Today while we wait out the wind and rain, I whipped up a simple soup, some Japanese curry, little sweet potato chippies and a couple of imperfect rice balls 🍙🍛 Stay safe, Japan ❤️
user_26;user_2685.jpg;Eating emojis 🍡🍡🍡 This is HANAMI DANGO ☺️ found at Nishiki today! 🇯🇵 #VeganInJapan
user_26;user_2686.jpg;Day 1 in Japan! 🇯🇵⛩ Kyoto has an older traditional feel to it - the streets are littered with traditional houses that are in great shape, everyone is riding bicycles everywhere and things are very chill and lovely. Vegan roasted soybean soft serve acquired at Nishiki Market! (Both of these are for me lol) 🌱🍦When it comes to cravings, I don’t play 😉 Sooo full of flavour and very silky, much creamier than you’d think just by looking at the texture. It GOOOD 👌🏼 Off to a fine start! #VeganInJapan #TofuIceCream #Kyoto
user_26;user_2687.jpg;Currently stuck in an airport and dreamin’ about this G🍦🍦DNESS…. I can totally use ice-cream as O’s, right?! 🧐 Major craves for @brainwavecafe’s new vegan soft serve back at home in Sydney - it’s Thai milk tea flavoured, which if you’ve never had before, is one of the best flavours your tastebuds will ever encounter 😋 Hope there’s some good vg soft-serve in Japan to curb these cravings until I get back home!!! 🤞🏼 Brainwave is a newer veg cafe of Sydney, but I reckon also one of the funkiest. It’s got serious vibes, a new vegan brekky menu and some rockin’ asian dishes. If you go, my favourites are the katsu-don: vegan cutlet atop rice, the avo-holic: the funnest avocado dish you will ever eat (think avo-3-ways), and the new vegan sweet sand sour ‘pork’ which tastes exactly how I remember it. Now Sydney frands, please gooooo and send me pics so that I may live vicariously through you. Will trade for Japanese vegan food porn. 😜🇯🇵
user_26;user_2688.jpg;Last day in Seoul!!! Kimbap, Bibimbap and Agar noodles from Gwangjang market! 😋 🇰🇷 Very happy with how much we have managed used our own containers in this city! Although we have had a couple of plastic moments, mostly in the first couple of days when I lacked the confidence to push for no plastic in my broken korean, the rest of the time has been successfully single-use free! #VeganInKorea
user_26;user_2689.jpg;No ad. No 10% code. Just grab any cup and make it BYO👌🏼 #NoSingleUsePlastic #EvenWhenGettingStreetfood
user_26;user_2690.jpg;Making our way through the last few spots on my list of Vegan spots in Seoul 🇰🇷😛 I don’t know how it’s worked out so well, but we’ve unintentionally saved all the best places for last. We’ve eaten the most delicious food over these last 3 days or so! I guess it’s because we’re staying kinda central to Seoul, and all the good stuff must be further out and away from all the touristy areas?! In any case, I’m super grateful it hasn’t been the other way around 😉 Today we had one of our best lunches yet at @gguncookinnew 🇰🇷 A kitchen that cooks without onion and garlic too, which is always super impressive when the flavours are 💥! #VeganInSeoul #비건
user_26;user_2691.jpg;No amount of rain can’t dampen this soul in Seoul! This city has me feeling sunny on all its days. 🌻🇰🇷
user_26;user_2692.jpg;There is SEOUL MUCH GOOD VEGAN FOOD HERE! 😱 I hope you‘re all enjoying my stories! I’m honestly just overwhelmed with the amount of vegan options here - I haven’t been posting many posts because my phone is just too crowded with amazing food pics and they all deserve hearty explanations or captions which I feel like I haven’t had time to write due to eating more amazing vegan noms. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just going to take my time and post them as I feel.⁣⁣ 🇰🇷⁣⁣ This was a set lunch I had, and a GF burg Will had at @so_iroum 😋 I’m currently writing a HUGE vegan guide to Seoul and editing some big vids feat. traditional Vegan Korean food ✌🏼 So keen to share! #VeganInKorea
user_26;user_2693.jpg;NEW VID: Vegan Korean Bakeries in Seoul! 🍰 More than just bread! We get Bingsu, Vegan CROISSANTS 🥐 (yeah ikr!!!?) and so many tasty treats - who knew Korea was this Vegan friendly? I certainly did not!

user_26;user_2696.jpg;Hello and just checking in from Korea! 🇰🇷 Another lovely day in Seoul 🚲 After some awesome sweet treats from @sunnybreadkr (rhubarb tart was my fave!), we hired bikes and biked along the Hangang River until the sun set. There were so many people just at the park having a picnic dinner and watching the sun set - UHHH it was so wholesome!! Eeep my heart is full! 🥰
user_26;user_2697.jpg;I am LIVING for VEGAN 👏🏼 KOREAN 👏🏼 STREET 👏🏼FOOD!!! 😱 There’s so much vegan food is available in Seoul - you just have to know where to look 😏 Maru Jayeonsik Kimbap is a little 100% vegan eatery in Insadong that serves up all the traditional street foods that you can find at the market with one difference. It’s all vegan! ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ I’ve been seeing the likes of tteokbokki, kimbap, hot-bar, mandu (dumplings) and odeng all over the markets but haven’t been able to have anything until we visited Maru! Been here a few times now and it’s absolutely fantastic. It’s very very well priced with great serving sizes and everything is served with a smile. Stay tuned for the vids, people. Definitely a must-visit in Seoul ⚡️ #vegankoreanstreetfood #insadong #마루자연식김밥
user_26;user_2698.jpg;You may not be in Korea but don’t fret, Sydney friends! There is some amazing new vegan noms right at home! 🥳😋 @brainwavecafe has a brand spankin’ new vegan brekky menu! Cara and I tried it just before I left and it’s colourful, nourishing and tasty ☺️ Check out my stories for more deets on dishes! ⁣⁣⁣ -⁣⁣⁣ On deck we have:⁣⁣⁣ 🥗 Super Nourish Bowl with vege-balls⁣⁣⁣ 🥓 Big Breakfast with chickpeas ⁣⁣⁣ 🥑 Avoholic (avocado 3-ways!)⁣⁣⁣ 🍧 Banana Berry Smoothie Bowl⁣⁣⁣ 🥞 Hotcake (one THICCC hotcake)⁣⁣⁣ 🍦 Thai Tea Soft Serve (not technically breakfast but don’t let that stop you ok)⁣⁣⁣ -⁣⁣⁣ We also had a sneaky sample of their new vegan sweet and sour ‘pork’ and it was wowzerssss.

user_26;user_2699.jpg;👀 Today we lunched on an assortment of Korean Temple Foods at Sanchon (산촌 사찰음식전문점) and it was just super duper! 😗 The food was simple and light but absolutely delicious. Oh mannnnn ☺️Three courses of an amazing set menu. Filmed it so it’s coming to a video near you soon! 🥢 Had to share a pic now too coz... well... everyone needs to see this gorgeousness. #VeganInKorea #Seoul #Vegan
user_26;user_26100.jpg;#workingwithsydneywater Growing sprouts ‘n’ seedlings takes some time, sun and WATER! 🌞🌿💧 Especially these avocado seeds, which can take months to sprout! I’m constantly making sure these bad boys have enough water to sit in and I’ve invested in a little greenhouse as a way to save a little more water. Giving my sprouts a little home means water evaporates more slowly 🏡 Less watering is needed and *bonus* it helps keep the heat in which also speeds up the sprouting process.

user_26;user_26101.jpg;Things that I thought would never happen: me turning into a GF-pizza hypeman - like HELLA HYPE. 🙀 @gigis_balmain, people! Not everything in this pic is gluten-free, but all the pizzas were. My dear gluten-free friends, your days of dense, dry and spongey-ass pizza bases are over. This ish is light, fluffy and tastes pretty spot on like a regular pizza bases. If I hadn’t known it was GF, I probably wouldn’t have picked up on it. For. Real. My favourite pizza was the Patata e Porcini hands DOWN. I’m talking potato, rosemary, porcini and red wine puree, Italian sausage and crispy tuscan kale.

user_26;user_26109.jpg;I like my matcha simple. 🍵 I’ve long tried so many different concoctions with different magical powders.... reishi, ashwaganda, spirulina, astragalus, tocos, coconut butter but naaaaah. Now? Ceremonial grade matcha, hot soy milk and maybe a little sugar is just 😙 How do you do yours?

user_26;user_26113.jpg;How crazy is it that I am fortunate enough to judge the food I eat. Who am I to say it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’?! I am part of a part of society where ONE, I don’t have to worry about going hungry, and TWO, I am also in a position where I can (and do) JUDGE the food that I depend on for my very survival. You probably are in a similar position too. I’ve been caught up in this thought recently as I learn more about the world and it’s people - including people right here in Sydney. The world is literally like The Hunger Games and we are the rich bastards who don’t even know what it’s like to go hungry. Here we are, playing games and having competitions and discussions about food. Food that a LOT of our fellow humans don’t have. This reoccurring thought is one of the reasons I haven’t felt a pull to share a lot of food content on instagram or youtube lately, and worked more on the market stall. But I’m still very much in love with food. Good food. I’m in love with eating it and sharing it and talking about it and even judging it. I don’t expect to stop sharing it any time soon. But one distant day that may change. I know I want to do good, on a big scale. Food is definitely part of that journey and I’m currently entering a world of new thoughts as I consider what happens next in my life. In different situations and in front of different people, I can feel either pride or shame in regards to being a food blogger. Let’s see where this journey takes me. Hmmmmm.
user_26;user_26114.jpg;If you travel to eat like I do 🤪and you’re planning on coming Sydney, make sure your plans include visiting @sydneyveganmarket. It should definitely be the main event of your eats in Sydney. As a local, I really do believe that it has theeeee best vegan food in Sydney and the vibe can not be matched!

user_26;user_26119.jpg;It’s Homelessness Week 2019. There is currently a state of emergency for homeless women in NSW. This week I’m wearing my hand-cut, hand-sewn badge from @LousPlace_Sydney to show my support for more housing to be prioritised for women across our state. 🧡⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ This is a topic I feel super passionate about, as it’s highly misunderstood and there are too many misconceptions about it. ⁣The words Recovery, Dignity and Safety have been chosen by the women of Lou’s to remind us that housing is about so much more than just a roof over your head. ⁣ -⁣⁣ 11,403 women will be homeless tonight in NSW.⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ 40% of women who are homeless are leaving family violence. ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ No one starts their recovery from addiction or mental illness while sleeping rough (on the streets).

user_26;user_26122.jpg;Today I’m lunching on some Northern Chinese side dishes, known as #liangcai (凉菜)! The traditional versions of these particular dishes should always just happen to be vegan and the best way to explain them would be common foods with uncommon flavours! ⚡️⚡️ We’ve basically got tofu, peanuts and potato, but jazzed up with different combos of Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, soy sauce, Chinese rice wine and sesame oil. 🥢 So flavourful but light at the same time! The tofu is is in the form of bean curd sheets, the peanuts are lightly braised in soy sauce (so umami!) and the potato is shredded and stir fried - super crunchy and unique! 🤩 I also swear there’s no better way of eating celery than in chinese cold dishes. 😉 #vegan #凉菜
user_26;user_26123.jpg;Vegetables at their finest!! Really can’t get over the new @bibimbapsydney bowl @buddhabowlcafe 😭🥰 I could honestly eat bibimbap every dang day #비빔밥
user_26;user_26124.jpg;GET THIS IN YA TUM! @buddhabowlcafe and @earthlingsasha/@bibimbapsydney have worked together to release a new vegan bibimbap! I am actually obsessed. 🤩 It’s packed with different prepared vegetable elements called NAMUL #나물, and this new bowl features some very unique authentic namul like GOSARI #고사리, delicious fern shoots high in protein and vitamin B2 and sweet-braised Lotus Root called YEONGEUN JORIM #연근조림 There’s also some very classic Korean soybean sprout namul, eggplant (!), kale, tofu and delishy spicy gochujang sauce. UGH Its so good. 🙏🏼😩 Available NOW! PuhLEASE go try it at @buddhabowlcafe and we can all be obsessed together ok thank you byyeee!
user_26;user_26125.jpg;Still buzz buzz buzzin’ from the market! (and washing 1000 tea towels + aprons 😅) - Missed having bibimbap dearly but I smashed this ramen by @nudo.ramen and aaah it’s so good! Generously topped with all the things including delish eggplant chunks (!) and has STRONG tonkotsu vibes and a full-flavoured broth.

user_26;user_26128.jpg;Not 100% happy today and that’s okay. That’s just how it is today. Everything changes. Nothing is permanent. Been a big week of relentless thinking 🤔 One of those weeks where my brain doesn’t shut up: Why haven’t you done this yet? Don’t forget to do that! Are you doing what makes you happy? You should probably exercise more! Be more positive! Post more videos! Post more stories! Live more eco-friendly! Get more followers! Do more markets! Grow more food! Volunteer more! Donate more! Look at this person, they do this. Wow. Look at this person, they do that. Damn I should be more like that. More, more, more, more, more... that’s been my brain on repeat until yesterday I was finally like HANG ON. Enough. Enough of this sh*t. You are enough, this is where you’re at and that’s cool. We all know we’re not supposed to hate on ourselves. It’s supposed to be all about #selflove these days. But knowing is one thing and doing is another, especially when we are so used to comparing ourselves, scrutinising, judging and just getting down on ourselves. We just gotta keep practicing. ☺️ That’s it. Groove on, sister ❤️

user_26;user_26131.jpg;Vegan strawberry pocky! 🥰🍓 I was never a chocolate kid, still am not. Strawberry flavour is my JAM. Strawberry milkshakes, strawberry ice cream, strawberry #yanyan, strawberry hello panda and strawberry pocky were my go tos and I wish everything was available VEGAN. @pockyusa what do you say!? There’s definitely a market for it 😏🍓🍓🍓Been meaning to make these for a while but only finally did it when Cara @theberrytraveller made me some on Thursday and then I decided I couldn’t survive the weekend without some more. She folded crushed freeze dried strawberries into vegan white choccy which was GENIUS and gives it a real fruity tang, so that’s what I did tooooo! I was lucky enough to have some pink @veganz chocolate too, so mine came out ultra pink which I LOVE!

I’ve honestly never been turned away. Sometimes they’re surprised because it’s just never happened before, so just be patient and explain you’re tryna save some plastic. I always have the lid off, straw out of the cup, so I just hand the empty cup over when I finish ordering and ask, ‘could you please just put it in this cup?’ You should be sweet from there. If anywhere wouldn’t take my cup I would just skip the bubble tea that day. At least I hopefully planted a thought-seed as to why people would want to bring their own cup. ⁣ -⁣ 🤔 Where’s the cup from? ⁣ 💁🏻‍♀️This is just a standard tall mason jar that I bought for $2 in Canada, but The LID however is a pop-top from @ecojarzaus and I use it everyday. It fits any wide mouth mason and also the fat straw. The STRAW is from @thesourcebulkfoods and I picked it up at the Balmain store. ⁣ -⁣ 🤔 Where can you get vegan bubble tea?⁣ 💁🏻‍♀️ Gong Cha has soy milk for no extra charge, @miandtea_ at the Sydney vegan market and @bean.code makes their own fresh soy milk daily!

user_26;user_26138.jpg;Giant tteokkochi! 😛 Pretty sure you’re supposed to chop these up before you cook them but my mind made a b-line to this inidividual-stick idea and then I just had to 🤷🏻‍♀️ ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ Tteokkochi is personally my fave form of tteok (korean rice cakes), spicy, sweet, salty, crispy, chewy and outrageously delicious! 🍢 The recipe lives on my website if you’re reeling for a spicy feeling ⚡️ #vegan
user_26;user_26139.jpg;Hot boba is game-changing and I’ve decided this winter I am all about it. On oat milk. Also game-changing is learning doing your laundry before you run out of clothes 👏🏼 What’s good in your 2019?
user_26;user_26140.jpg;So here’s some tea: I used to LOVE eggs. In fact, eggs themselves are still delicious in my mind and I still get mad cravings for eggy things (I know heaps of vegans will find this gross - sorry but true) 😩 I went through a phase of pretending I was super over eggs but... I really don’t think I am. They’re yum and I get it 🤷🏻‍♀️⁣ -⁣ THE THING IS - the egg industry is disgustingly efffed. Like EFFED. We’ve all been lied to and all the nasty stuff is hushed up which is why most people have noooooo idea what happens. 🤔 Don’t take my word for it, look it up and make up your own mind about it. (And no, don’t go on egg-farm sites obvi). If you’ve been thinking about going ditching them eggies, I’m here for you! If I can, you can! And if you haven’t thought about ditching them, maybe start! 👯‍♀️⁣ -⁣ SO. For days when this eggy cravings hit, I’m thankfulAF for all things in the savoury-substitute-egg department. 🍳Tofu scramble, chickpea flour, BLACK SALT (aka magic eggy smelly salt) and all them big science people working on vegan egg products. The vegan egg world is getting bigger! ⁣ -⁣ Anyone else loved eggs before going vegan? Legit comment coz people don’t believe me when I say I loved/love eggs. 🍳💔 #breakupwitheggs

Super simple recipe below if you want to give it ago! ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ 🍫 Microwave 50g vegan butter and 1 cups of choc chips together for 1 minute. Mix until smooth and all choc chips have melted. ⁣⁣ 🍫In a separate bowl, microwave 3 tbsp peanut butter and 1 cup vegan marshmallows together, and stir until all mallows are melted. ⁣⁣ 🍫Transfer both mixes into a large mixing bowl along with 2 cups Rice Bubbles, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 cup crushed salted-peanuts and 1/3 cup desiccated coconut. ⁣⁣ 🍫Transfer mix into a lined baking tray refrigerate until firm (at least an hour)!

user_26;user_26145.jpg;In society as we know it, the system distracts us so much that we aren’t always able to see the full picture. 🤔Problems overlap other problems and rich and powerful make it very difficult to make any needed systemic change. Our only other option is to stay hopeful, stay driven, stay passionate about change-for-good, and start with small changes in our own lives, our own actions and our own communities. ❤️ Every bit does count. ⁣ -⁣ I’m so proud to announce that @mylkandbun will finally be able to contribute to an issue I feel strongly about. It’s always been the plan for this little stall to help tackle the issue of homelessness, and we are just getting started. ✊🏼⁣ -⁣ Homelessness is a social issue that not many seem to know about (I myself didn’t until I did a unit on it at university), and I was truly shocked at the statistics and how complicated it is. ⁣ -⁣ 3 things you probably didn’t know:⁣ 1️⃣ Only 7% of people who are homeless in Australia are sleeping on the streets. Majority are couch-surfing with friends or family, sleeping in cars or staying at shelters and hostels.⁣ 2️⃣ 15,872 Australian children under 12 years old are homeless. This creates instability in their lives, affects education and development and creates uncertainty in their futures.⁣ 3️⃣ The majority of causes of homelessness are NOT drug and alcohol use. ⁣ -⁣ Thanks to everyone who has offered to help and volunteer already. You guys can definitely expect me to talk about this, but for now this is all I’ll share. In the next few weeks I will be learning about more ways in which we as individuals can do more to help. You’ve heard it before: #BeTheChange

user_26;user_26160.jpg;One of my favourite spots ever is a little Japanese cafe in India! 🇯🇵 Cafe Okaeri has only 4 tables and Michiko the owner/chef is the only person working there. She moved to India over 10 years ago and now serves simple but delicious vegan food from her humble little cafe up in the hills of Rishikesh. It’s a delight. Will remember her little vegan soy puddings forever.

user_26;user_26163.jpg;Have you made mochi yet!? 🍡😋It is so so so easy and authentically vg+gf! Use any filling you like! Here’s a basic microwave-method below: ⁣⁣ -⁣⁣ ⚡️BASIC MICROWAVE MOCHI⚡️⁣⁣ 🌱 naturally vegan + gluten-free 🌱⁣⁣ ~⁣⁣ Ingredients: ⁣⁣ 3/4 cup glutinous rice flour (I use erawan brand)⁣⁣ 3/4 cup water ⁣⁣ 2 tbsp sugar ⁣⁣ Cornstarch or potato starch for dusting⁣⁣ ~⁣⁣ Method:⁣⁣ Dust a tray heavily with cornstarch and set aside. Pre-prepare 6-8 balls of a filling of your choice and refrigerate for 20 mins (e.g peanut butter, red bean paste, black sesame paste). Mix all mochi ingredients (not filling) in a microwave safe bowl until VERY SMOOTH! Be patient - lumps are 🤦🏻‍♀️ and make for a lumpy mochi 😅. Microwave for 2 minutes. Mix your mixture aggressively! Microwave for another 1 minute! Mix again until you have an even and sticky dough, and scoop out onto the dusted tray. The cornstarch helps the mochi not stick to anything. The mochi will still be hot so be careful, but you will need to work while it’s still hot. Cover mochi in cornflour and form into a log. Cut into 6-8 pieces. Form each piece into a circle and use it to encase a filling of your choice. Pinch to seal in the filling! ⁣⁣ ~⁣⁣ RECIPE VIDEO ON MY YT CHANNEL on how to make red bean paste + matcha mochi + strawberry mochi! ⁣⁣ ~⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ .⁣⁣ #mochi #daifuku #homemademochi #vegandessert #japanesecooking #japanesefood #veganjapanesefood⁣⁣

user_26;user_26177.jpg;This month we’re looking at JAPANESE food! 🇯🇵🏯🗾 I’ve always felt a pull to this wonderful culture - one that combines both tradition and modernity, and I’m so excited to explore it this month. Shibumi (渋み) refers to the particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. I think one reason it’s so easy to fall in love with Japan is because the Japanese tend to celebrate simplicity, and we could all use a little more simplicity in our lives. ⁣ -⁣ This morning I spent the day exploring a few Japanese supermarkets where the lovely tenshu (店主) taught me so many new things about handmade Japanese daifuku and mochi! 🍡 And this was the dinner at @thisismanmaru, which serves an array of bio-dynamic, sustainable, fermented foods.

user_26;user_26186.jpg;Make 2 kinds of Dim Sum dumplings!!! (Just posted a vid - link in B, bby) 🥟🥟🥟 I grew up eating so many of these bad boiizzzz and I’m SO happy with this super easy vegan version! 🌱 The first one is the very classic ‘Har Gow’ Prawn Dumpling (shrimp if you’re from ‘murrrrica) and the second is ‘Gao Choi Har Gow’, a Garlic Chive and Prawn Dumpling. I personally prefer the latter - I just love Garlic Chives in a dumpling! It’s also even better if you pan-fry immediately after steaming. I highly recommend. 10/10. Yes yes YES.⁣ -⁣ They are so fun to make! The hardest part is probably rolling the wrappers and folding the dumplings, but after a few tries you’ll be a pro! And tbh it doesn’t have to be perfect - it’s more about experiencing the dumpling making process and getting to eat something you’ve created! ⁣ -⁣ Both dumplings are steamed and delicious pockets of YUM and taste so damn super authentic thanks to @lamyongaustralia and their vegan prawns! 🍤 I personally think this is their best product (and my favourite) - the flavour and texture of the prawns is on POINT and they’re so easy to cook! Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have had fun creating it! 🕺🏻⁣ ⁣ #VeganDimSum #VeganDumplings #蝦餃 #HarGow

Seriously WHO!!?🤷🏻‍♀️⁣ ⁣ In reality, these techniques and methods were probably developed over decades, if not centuries of different combinations all leading to the most deliciousness dishes. Each region also adding their own pizzazz and flair. Continual creation, continual discovery and continual improvement - I’m so for it 💁🏻‍♀️ ⁣ ⁣ Now it’s the time for vegan dim sum, so we’re taking everything one step further!

If that’s not #selflove I don’t know what is! - In this recipe we’re using the Sayur Roast Pork by @lamyongaustralia 🍃!

user_26;user_26195.jpg;CRISPY EGGPLANT TARO MANTOU BURG! 🍆 Crispy eggplant katsu, slaw and a little hoisin to glue it all together on a soft and fluffy taro steamed bun! Yesterday I saw @annachaannn’s mantou burger from Taiwan and today I woke up on a mission to create a vegan version 🙏🏼 Mission COMPLETE! It’s the eggplant from my sticky eggplant but I double-crumbed it in cornflake crumbs before deep frying! #vegan #mantouburger #veganburger

user_26;user_26197.jpg;Man I love these markets so much. They are a serious vibe. As a visitor, as a stall holder, this event is seriously just so much fun, everyone is so supportive, so many people bring their own containers and oh my good lordy LORD there is so much EXCELLENT FOOD! 🕺🏻 - Some faves I hit up this month: @ishouldbe_souvlaki (the best vegan food in wrap form EVER) @miandtea_ (NEW! The lemongrass banh mi is absolutely bonkers and I LOVE the bubble tea!) @treat.dreams (frappe game is so delectable and delish!) @bibimbapsydney (they can do no wrong and the newest addition to the menu, kimchi fried rice, was astoundingly good. Perfect amount of spice!) @plantbasedeatery (We religiously get the chilli cashew chicken and taro spring rolls every market and it’s consistently on point) @funkypiesbondicafe (theeee flakiest damn pies of your life) - Also got an excellent jar of tomato chutney 🍅, made from rescue imperfect toms, from the food-waste warriors at @fortunatefood!
user_26;user_26198.jpg;Get in ma TUM! 🤤🥢 I’ve come a long way. I remember being so absolutely crap at folding dumplings as a kid. I rolled strange multi-sided wrappers, I tried to put way too much filling in and they almost always burst when they were cooked. 😅 But it was fun to be apart of it. Dumplings are a family affair and each Chinese family tends to have their own special recipe, a specific filling, a specific way to wrap dumplings. It takes time, patience and a lot of practice but it’s always worth it! Time and care and ❤️ definitely make food more delicious! Check out these beauties! 🥟🥟🥟 #vegandumplings
