user_27;user_270.jpg;When was the last time you were fully present? Dedicate even just 10 minutes today, to fully arriving here. Use your breath to guide you home. Get your bare feet on the Earth. Surrender to the sensations of the wind. Anytime your mind wanders, draw it back. Feel into the expansive limitless realm of the present, how all things have the power to be born through and healed here. 🦋 May you experience the nothingness that you are. May you experience the totality of everything you are. May you touch the part of yourself that merges with the divine.
user_27;user_271.jpg;Your angels are waiting for you to call upon them... Enter a state of meditation and ask, “Show me the power of your miracles” be slow, listen, receive. The thoughts in your head aren’t random, often times they are your guides trying to assist you, for every single one of us is a channel for higher consciousness. With all that is going on prioritize stillness like never before. Even the wind has messages for those who listen with their whole body. Let me know what’s coming through for you. xx
user_27;user_272.jpg;An appreciation post for some of my closest friends, thank you for making my life better in every way. I would do absolutely anything to support your growth in all things and literally just want to reflect back all the love you’ve created in me. Here are some old moments on Polaroid [ the only recent photos are with D after we broke months of self isolation to protest together] I’m so humbled to be surrounded by people who nourish me fully 🦋
user_27;user_273.jpg;Healing looks like more than just doing yoga and meditation. Healing looks like silently crying on the bathroom floor at 2am. It looks like cups of tea in every corner of your room. It looks like screaming into the wind. The real work is messy and uncomfortable and even triggering. That’s good, get triggered, get uncomfortable. Welcome everything. This is how we work through our karma. This is how we break the cycle. The system is being cracked open, more people (including myself) are being educated on the systematic oppression that has been playing out for years. To heal as a collective means we all must crack open and take a look at the ways we have been perpetuating racism and feeding into harmful stereotypes. It means paying homage to the struggles behind the hairstyles and trends we borrow from black culture, honoring the black lives taken by police brutality, standing up in the face of discrimination and refusing to support companies who support black oppression. “ I understand that I will never understand. However, I stand.”
user_27;user_274.jpg;The lie is the belief that you have to suffer in silence... Comment some things you’ve learned about mental health. I think it could be really beautiful :,)
user_27;user_275.jpg;Stay home, talk to your plants and play dress up instead.. Pretty much my lifestyle since I was 8 years old listening to Britney Spears with my roller blades on around the house. When I was younger I genuinely thought there was something wrong with me for wanting to be alone all the time. Up until I graduated I would often feel exhausted from socializing. I didn’t like wasting my voice on the mundane or having surface level conversations. I wanted to speak the truth even if it was painful, I wanted to facilitate growth and healing from my exchanges. It wasn’t until I found my tribe that I started to love this about myself and feel liberated in my own silence. We are so quick to demonize our feelings and invalidate ourselves if they’re different from everybody else’s ! As you get older the beautiful thing is that you realize you feel just as alien as everybody else. [ styling ethically made pieces from @lacausaclothing ]
user_27;user_276.jpg;Did you know there’s no such thing as a “bad” meditation? One of my favorite ways to describe meditation is, simply saying “Hello” to yourself. Whatever may come up is valid, and will reveal where the inner work ( aka deconditioning, re-writing, forgiving, healing ) can begin. We’re so used to comparing ourselves and our progress that some people refuse to meditate for fear that they won’t be good enough. All it really takes is a deep breath and curiously watching as the stories unfold. For many people on their journeys, we’re starting fresh everyday. There’s no comparing. Every moment we’re given an opportunity to breathe through the chaos, to use our tools to witness rather than react, and embody our practice. Some days it’s easier than others. Having a consistent meditation practice is only meant to help us return to love as quickly as possible, and make this human stuff a little easier ✨
user_27;user_277.jpg;I remember driving with my friend to get @PlanBOneStep emergency contraception during high school. #Ad I could hear the adrenaline and fear in her voice when she called me telling me the condom she used with her partner broke. We didn’t have a safe place to go to talk about sex, so we really supported each other during times like these. We drove to the closest CVS and found Plan B right off the shelf - no prescription or ID required. Ever since then I’ve tried to be a resource for the women in my life, and I want to make sure you have the information you need. So, what is Plan B? Plan B helps prevent pregnancy before it starts by temporarily delaying ovulation. A lot of people call it the morning after pill, but the fact is, it should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, or if your primary birth control method falls through. But, the sooner you take it the better it works! Sometimes our Plan A doesn’t work out, but it feels good to know there is another option. That said, it shouldn’t be used as a regular form of birth control. Stay safe and keep supporting your friends! Make sure to always read the label. Check out the link in my bio and stories for more information on Plan B.
user_27;user_278.jpg;Sometimes growth is so subtle that you don’t even realize it’s taken place. Until you wake up one morning and smile at the sun shining in, moaning as you stretch your body and tangle your limbs further into your sheets. There’s a moment that feels like fine sand sifting through your fingertips, a deep clarity of the gift you have just arisen to. And the reverence extends to every arc and roadblock along your journey. You remember that waking up in peace is a miracle. You remember how breathing once felt painful, and breakfast felt like giving up. How even now when those feelings return, they never stay. You’ve learned that they speak but you don’t have to listen. Every single day you chose to love, despite it all and now it seems as if love is choosing you... it always has been.
user_27;user_279.jpg;We’re on planet Zenon. You ask me to prom. This is what I wear :
user_27;user_2710.jpg;When I was younger my checks at the school cafeteria would always bounce, so I started stealing food to eat at school. In 6th grade I jumped out of a third story window. I got into my first fight in 7th grade, the girl brought a knife. A year later I got in trouble with the cops for being with gang affiliated thieves in a stolen car, I had no idea about either. The year after that I watched someone snort Molly and stare at a fish tank for an hour, while one guy got branded on his right butt cheek, my friends and I got pulled over that night but the cop let us go. I wasn’t even 15 when all of this happened. And this was just the beginning. By the time I was a sophomore in High School I was over all the partying and bullshit. This is when my spiritual journey really began.  I get asked how do I stay genuinely happy or if I’ve always been this “way”. The truth is, I have been seeking safe space for years, without even really knowing it. I’ve always carried tenderness in my heart, and for a lot of these moments I felt like an alien observing my surroundings, taking them in and trying not to get lost. My past is just a story the one I’m writing now wouldn’t be possible without. I know a lot of you have had tougher or crazier experiences, but I always feel waves of bliss just knowing I am safe. At any moment, I can look up at the sky and genuinely say “thank you” with a smile on my face and in my heart. For all I have learned, all I have healed, and all that’s been gifted. Your past does not define you, and if you’re going to look back make sure it’s to see how far you’ve come <3
user_27;user_2711.jpg;If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you go and why? What places have been deeply resonant with your soul? Heh only casual questions here ✨
user_27;user_2712.jpg;For the first time in a long time I feel like my body and my mind are fully my own. The more I drop into the senses, into asana, into song and dance, the more access I have to that deeper presence within. It almost feels like I’m giving birth to myself. So much of my conditioning and self inflicted stress came to the surface to be cleared. I held space for it until I was brimming with tenderness again. I learned early on that there’s no point in running from absolutely anything. Because what needs to be felt will always manifest itself in some form, demanding to be acknowledged. There’s nothing to fear. On the other side of the resistance is so much love. Take a deep breath, make space for what’s swelling up inside. Reclaim your sovereignty.
user_27;user_2713.jpg;Give yourself permission to be your most fully embodied self. Whatever that means. Moment to moment, don’t hold back your voice, your dance, your tears or your prayers. Let the wild woman crawl out of you and howl today. Spend some time on all fours pushing away the Earth, rotating your hips, tilting your head back in pleasure. Make new sounds. Dance courageously through the shadow and light within. Speak to the sky. Let your senses take you over. Resist nothing. Feel your infinite self emerging.
user_27;user_2714.jpg;Continue to move, continue to die, continue to breathe, continue to be reborn. Shed all that needs to be shed. Welcome everything. Reclaim your power. Go deeper, further within, than you ever have before. And at the end of every week, write yourself a love letter for how good you’re doing despite it all : )
user_27;user_2715.jpg;There is a meditation to be found in ritual, in connecting to the subtler and subtler layers of being. Yoga has been twice daily for me, I feel my body remembering things my mind can’t. I’ve been cleaning, chanting, dancing, cooking, reading. There are less thoughts and more presence. When you are resting in the witnessing it can initially feel frightening not to “feel” in the same way you’re used to. I always get caught off guard at the experience of having no emotional reaction to things. But only because this is the way we have been conditioned, to get animated and heated about everything in our external realm. A true testament to your practice is how well you can simply witness and return to equanimity and love. Nothing is happening directly to us, it’s all just happening, a grand unfolding. What rituals have you been doing? What helps you surrender?
user_27;user_2716.jpg;Reminders : Make more art Be more kind Heart centered awareness Consume everything as medicine Condition your mind to focus on the good more than the bad Honor energy over everything You are attracting the frequency you are in
user_27;user_2717.jpg;You know you’re tapped in when it feels like coming home :) #sisterhood
user_27;user_2718.jpg;And every so often, if you get still enough, the overlapping sounds of the mundane happenings of the world will resonate like a symphony of angels. You will look around teary eyed and in awe at the presence of God in every one. The conversations between humans will take place in slow motion, a smile upon someone’s face will feel heaven sent. Everything you have previously seen taking place will, for the first time, feel radiant with divinity... it has always been this way but now you have the eyes to see. The way the light pours in from the sky and caresses a strangers face, the look in the eyes of people who have known each other for a very long time, the lost soul looking for answers in the sky, the colours, the overlapping sounds of life, a vignette of beauty all around. This existence is a miracle, each breath is an opportunity, let the mere happening of life leave you in awe. How grand it all is.
user_27;user_2719.jpg;If you struggle with anxiety ~ Try to start and end your day with conscious breathing. ~ Make a list of reasons to be proud of yourself at the end of every day or week. It can include simple things like “ I cooked a healthy nourishing meal for myself” or “I had more positive thoughts about my future.” ~ Talk to someone, use voice memos or journal to release the narratives running wild in your mind. ~ Anxiety is born in the mind, spend more time doing things that make your mind feel effortlessly still. ~ Ask yourself: Will I continue to perpetuate these feelings or break the cycle by acting out of love even when I’m feeling this way? ~ When having a panic attack, extend your exhale double the length of your inhale. By doing a 4 count inhale, 8 count exhale until you feel calm again.This breathing pattern ended my anxiety after using it consistently for a month!
user_27;user_2720.jpg;So much life (and death) is happening away from this screen. If you see this post, please take 8 deep belly breaths and allow yourself to drop into every sensation in your body ✨ #energiafeminina
user_27;user_2721.jpg;My home in humans... Forever grateful to experience deep intimacy with friends ♥️
user_27;user_2722.jpg;All I wanted was to feel safe, and then life gave me so much more than that. Every day I bow down and thank the sky for allowing me to see the love in everything, I worship every bit of this existence ✨🙏🏼
user_27;user_2723.jpg;And when the time comes, allow yourself to dance in the lightness of being again 🌾 This simple bliss is all I crave. To be in love, to be in nature and to feel no separation from it all.
user_27;user_2724.jpg;All the bi, pixie, heartbreak visions your heart desires in one video ✨💕🦋Thank you @raveena_aurora for calling upon me for this. ‘Headaches’ out now!
user_27;user_2725.jpg;Let me know your current prayers, blessings or manifestations. I want to share them with the mountains ✨
user_27;user_2726.jpg;I speak in the language of softness and femininity, this is where my power lies. I am drawn to spaces where I can provide the tenderness of “woman”. Spaces where I can speak with no words, where I can hold your hand and know everything I need to know. My power lies in the listening. I don’t feel the need to speak that often, but when I do I want every word to be a prayer. And when people can’t receive this love, my firey Kali does not come out, instead the softness becomes even softer, my voice a whisper, and I disappear into the noise of your world. My love is so subtle but so strong and when it can’t be received I simply bow down and keep dancing my dance... Notes on being a highly sensitive person navigating all the realms of being ✨
user_27;user_2727.jpg;Concept: The sun is shining on your skin, your heart is open, breath is deep, and utter peace washes over every cell in your body. You are whole, you are complete. The depth at which you embody your beliefs will determine their effect in your life. If you want miracles to happen, be the miracle 💫 [ photo taken last August in the Sahara dessert. Somewhere I hope to return.
user_27;user_2728.jpg;When you speak as a way to love, you will always be liberated. Because you are using the gift of voice as a tool to liberate others. And when you write to love, you will always be liberated. Because you are honoring the sacred transmission of these words aching to be set free. And when you love just to love, you will always be liberated Because you are tuning into your truest purpose on this earth, which is of the highest benefit to all beings everywhere. Arriving at this frequency allows miracles to unfold.  Loving is a rebellious act in a world hardened by fear. Remembering, trusting, surrendering are all acts of courage. To break through the molds of generations and shine light into a new world.. This is what this current paradigm shift feels like to me, making our existence a living prayer to the Earth. Using all modalities of expression in communion with love.
user_27;user_2729.jpg;A single act of self love can transform the course of our energy throughout our day. To facilitate this shift in my own life, I love cleaning my entire space and then putting on this tea tree, aloe and chlorophyll face mask from @bioClarity. I’ve been using this for so long and am so happy to share my discount code for 15% off your own bioClarity products using the code HITOMI. Of course, they are all vegan, cruelty free and use plant based botanicals that support collagen health and anti aging. I also love massaging my entire body with aloe vera while I dance naked with the sun on my skin. I take this special sacred energy I cultivate in my sanctuary and bring it out into the world with me. In order to be present with anyone or anything, we must first be present with ourselves ✨ #gardengivenbeauty #bioclarity #bioclaritypartner
user_27;user_2730.jpg;It’s strange, but the older I become, the more connected I feel to my inner child and yearn to nurture her soo deeply. The depth of love we can pour into these vessels will reveal to us the freedom we’ve always been searching for. You will find that in the space of unconditional love, you are worthy, you always have been and nothing can change that. No matter how you show up. You no longer need to continue perpetuating cycles of fear or lacking, you can get out of your own way and allow miracles to unfold without subconsciously denying them. You can open yourself up to the world like a young child who still knows anything is possible.. My last post was taken down so here is a wholesome video of me eating a baguette at sunset in Provence ✨ Comment below your favorite line from a piece of literature 🌹 I want to know what’s roaming around in your psyche
user_27;user_2731.jpg;Your soul needs better quality food. It has been detoxing. You have been shedding old thoughts, feelings, pains and struggles. Memories of the past have been flooding out of your soul, like parasites being expunged. And now, your soul thus cleansed is in need of genuine nourishment to restore it to full radiance and vitality. Love will feed your hungry soul. Nothing less shall suffice. [ Alana Fairchild’s words from my Rumi oracle deck ] This has been resonating so deeply as I intentionally shape each breath and therefore each moment of my life. Breathing in clarity exhaling chaos. Witnessing all. Especially my own BS haha holding myself accountable in the most nurturing way has been very real lately. I’m learning how to balance all the passions that I’m blessed to carry in life, and wow I never thought life could be so busy yet so full. I’m grateful for how deeply my tools are being called upon to keep me feelin GooooOd. Every obstacle provides us an opportunity to deepen into the practices that keep us aligned 🙏🏼 Sending a blessing to every soul who reads this & leaving you with a question: are your thoughts making you more free or more trapped ? 📷 @erickj888
user_27;user_2732.jpg;I recently completed my Doula training, doula means “slave” in Greek and is essentially the role of the nurturer to pregnant and postpartum moms. I’ve never felt anything more strongly aligned than this. Since I was little I made sure people felt taken care of and safe. Partially because I didn’t always have that growing up, but as we get older it’s our responsibility to take ownership of what we are creating for our lives. This work feels like the ultimate service and rewriting of stories. So excited for this new chapter in my life, but I’m still learning and building my doula network. Luckily I discovered @BumbleBizz which makes networking so easy. Download the @bumble app and enter Bizz mode. It's similar to dating but instead of potential romantic partners, you connect with business professionals. You have the option of choosing what you’re looking for in a connection, be it freelance work, a mentor, investor or internship. If you’re starting (or interested in starting) a new business chapter in your life or just looking to expand your network, I definitely suggest using @bumblebizz to surround yourself with a supportive professional community!
user_27;user_2733.jpg;Another lil’ manifestation post ✨ If any of these resonate with you, save this and come back to breathe in these visions. Can you tell how soft and tender my day dreams are? Heh. I’m dreaming of a more compassionate peaceful world. I truly believe so much would shift if we were all more present in each moment. Present with our fears, present with our breath, present with the energetic state of our body and the amount of love that has been missing. So much violence is born into the world because so many of us are violent within ourselves. For things to truly be healed or shifted they have to be solved at the level of consciousness. Let’s start by being fully embodied, let’s start by being kinder to ourselves and anchoring into presence, let’s create a new world right here in this moment, by returning to love. Embody your beliefs and wishes... [ images from tumblr, if you know any of the artists let me know :]
user_27;user_2734.jpg;Editing some yoga videos in my sweet treehouse home 🐒 I’m so grateful for new platforms like @bumblebizz emerging because they make it so much easier to network, meet a mentor or find work that you're passionate about. As an entrepreneur in the wellness world, this is so important! I have so many lightworkers by my side to recommend to people I teach. We're creating our potential in each moment and there is no one path to be followed. @bumblebizz thanks for empowering us entrepreneurs to come together.  If you didn’t know, I spent about four weeks in college when I was 17 before dropping out. I moved across the country solo to California, having no idea what to expect,  I was naturally faced with a lot of challenges. I immediately felt in my body that taking out loans for a degree at a school I didn’t feel confident it was not going to work out well for me in the long run. Coming from a low-income household I always felt naturally inclined to get good a certain trade rather than get a degree... And that’s exactly what I’ve been doing! There have been tons of ups and downs but nothing feels more freeing and safe than meeting my intuition with consistent work ethic. Download the @Bumble app and make a profile on Bumble Bizz to pursue that thing you’ve always wanted to.#BumbleBizz #MaketheFirstMove #BumblePartner 📷 @erickj888

user_27;user_2737.jpg;Everywhere outside in the Fall is a cathedral, a holy place. Happy Scorpio season 🦂🌙May we all be the alchemists of our lives and the sorcerers of our energy. May we consciously create our realities. May we feel sooo blessed every day, for every little thing. May we overflow with the fullness and beauty of life... What are you breathing into right now?
user_27;user_2738.jpg;Are there any areas of your psyche that you are running from? Or that feel too scary to face? This is where you should begin your inner work.  All shadow that confronts you is an opportunity to deepen into the light. To anchor into love over fear and write a new story 🕊 ~ Polaroids from France ~
user_27;user_2739.jpg;What is your intuition trying to tell you right now?
user_27;user_2740.jpg;Deep Belly Breathing mmm  I woke up feeling a bit bloated this morning from eating late. My breath felt a little shallower so I dropped into a seated cat cow to bring it back down to my tummy. Connecting the movement with the breath.  Deep belly breathing enables us to breathe deeper into our diaphragm rather than our chest which can cause strain on our shoulders and is usually the way we breathe when we have anxiety. This also brings more oxygen to our digestion, strengthens our pelvic floor and more fully oxygenates our bodies. As the yogis say “the length of your breath determines the length of your life”. If ever you’re feeling anxious, bloated, unable to sit still, focus on extending & slowing your breath! Inhaling to fill your tummy as much as you can, exhaling your navel back to your spine. It’s enchanting to experience the wisdom and healing it provides :)))
user_27;user_2741.jpg;The best thing you can do when you feel like you’re falling apart is talk to someone honestly. Honesty can break the chain of stories running wild inside. Honesty can anchor us into the present, where all things have the space to be healed. You’re never too far gone or too unworthy.  This is a reminder I wrote for myself and for you. I love you. Close your eyes. Take the next breath. Take the next step. Reach out to your life lines. You are so loved, and love will always keep you safe.  P.s. smile for 5 seconds right now & feel the shift P.p.s I’m wearing a layer of foundation in this & the lighting was bomb ✌🏼just keepin it real
user_27;user_2742.jpg;And sometimes I put shoes & clothes on & play around in this human suit! I want to dance between all the realms without limitation, fear or judgement. No more dogma or labels or compartmentalizing. I am here to listen and be carried by the energy of love. I often hold my hands at my heart in Anjali mudra as a way to honor and bow down to the light in others and the infinite love in each moment. Soo beyond humbled my doods #stayconnected #tosource #energy #within
user_27;user_2743.jpg;I am grateful for every cell that composes my being and works to keep me alive everyday. I am no longer trying to destroy who I am but evolve to the highest version of my myself. I have chosen to find love within every aspect of my reality and become lighter through the shedding of negative thought patterns, traumas and being truly deeply grateful for everything. I am so blessed to receive ! Every day I wake up and express gratitude in my heart for everyone I get to share love with, for my body that is not perfect but natural and ever changing. For the omens I receive, for the shifting and awakening of the collective consciousness, for music, for art, for the yearning to do good, for expansion, for healing, for the sun... T h a n k Y o u life for having me.
user_27;user_2744.jpg;I care more about the amount of love I have to share than the amount of times my post gets shared. I care more about the times that I have risen than the times that I have fallen, creating light even in worlds of dark. I care more about what I can do for others than what they can do for me What if we started defining our worth in this way? Or if we spent as much time on our souls as we did our makeup? How beautiful would we allow ourselves to feel? We are already everything we ever wanted to be, there is a part of us that already knows. That already vibrates at a divine frequency, for this is our most natural state, beneath all the noise. Luminous light energy filling our being, facilitating the awakening of consciousness... can you feel the undercurrent? || very moody pics by @manbrandler 🤪 ✨
user_27;user_2745.jpg;Some days I cry as I walk down the sidewalk, just at the mere witnessing of life, how I feel so much love and empathy and connection towards complete strangers. How the world is so ugly and odd and perplexing and homey at the same time. I just want to wrap myself up in all that surrounds me. I want to squeeze the hands of strangers, the single mothers with young children, the old men with canes used to help carry the weight of loss in their hearts. I want to fill all of the empty space with unconditional love. I let the tears stream down my face and fall to the ground, I don't wipe them off or try to stop myself. I feel simply and utterly overwhelmed at the beauty and perfection in every moment. That I can bare humble witness to this wild dance upon life’s stage.
user_27;user_2746.jpg;Why would you wish darkness upon yourself when light shines all around you?
user_27;user_2747.jpg;Spend time speaking to the spirits of the Earth and they will begin to speak back. Meditate on it, breathe it in, drop into your heart and listen to what love has to say. ~ For those at a crossroads or unsure of their next step. Don’t forget to trust. Sometimes things are placed upon our path to teach us discernment between fueling our egos and fueling our mission. When an opportunity is placed upon your path to enhance your souls song on this Earth you will know. I believe we’re all here to free ourselves from the greatest illusion, to be of service to each other, to walk each other home, to awaken to the truth that we’re all connected on the energetic plane, that love is omnipresent, that divinity lingers everywhere even in our own spine. It is up to us as individuals to become clear on our beliefs because they become guiding forces of our life. During any time of uncertainty simply ask your heart, what reality would I be adding to if I stepped in this direction? Is it aligned with my mission? Remember to listen
user_27;user_2748.jpg;When I was 17 I was admitted to the hospital for suicidal tendencies, I thought it was mostly awful but I left knowing exactly how to take the good parts and make them accessible in every day life. To nurse myself back to a healthy state of being.  Anytime I feel a depression seeping in, I make a plan of action specifically tailored to what will make my heart feel safe and free. I find things to get excited about that involve a skill and human interaction (sounds silly but it’s easy to isolate when you’re sad) or make plans to cook with friends. Spending time with community that accurately sees you is so so essential. I write down a weeks worth of grounding and nourishing meal ideas so I can feel good in my body. I make sure to completely clean my space once a week, even that simple task will make me feel accomplished and proud of myself. If I’m particularly sad I always always tell someone! I don’t watch movies that are extremely sad or scary because it can be hard to shake off that energy when I’m already in a low place. And of course I continue with my yoga asana, pranayama, meditation practices. Making a “plan of action” when I start to feel these denser energies is something that has become habitual. I just know something in my alchemy has to change a bit and once I adjust, my vessel of energy can continue working at its most optimal state and Love can flow freely through my veins.
user_27;user_2749.jpg;Life is so C O L O U R F U L L. I want to cherish these moments, the ones where I laugh so hard that everything feels light and peace overcomes my body. The Sunday mornings when I carve out “I <3 Us” onto slightly burnt toast because that’s the way you like it. Indoor New York City bodega picnics and sleepovers where we talk all night in the darkness getting to know the hidden parts of one another. Love between friends. Naps where you sleep just the right amount ( I mean wow ). Someone told me I should post less professional photos every now and then and I’d really like to. Life is composed of so many little vignettes, usually the simplest most tender ones, often overlooked in the moment, become the most resonant in our hearts.
user_27;user_2750.jpg;There will be times when you have no choice but to be near water, naked, bare chest down as it washes over you silencing out the world. Moss sticking to your legs as you smell that wild smell of things that grow freely, effortlessly in their own time. When you feel you might start fires or thunderstorms with your words if you do not drive into the wind soon. You may have to run through the woods as fast as you can, jumping over fallen trees and dancing on the earth until you can feel nothing but the pulsing of each breath throughout your body. You may have to get mud on your skin and scale mountain rocks on all fours, seeing how far your howl can travel in the wind. You may need to spend endless nights looking at starry skies illuminated by moonlight as something within you begins to remember and awaken... And you may feel that you just might die if you do not do this because the wild woman within all of us is clawing to be set free.

Beyond even light or dark Call upon me when things move too fast or far too slow And I will come, like an ease within your body, I will come like a flicker of light in the darkness, I will come as a gentle hum in your ear I will come from deep, deep within Whispering I am here. It is safe. Let us rise.
user_27;user_2753.jpg;There is a subtle language of all living things. Omens, messages constantly being transmuted through spirit guides, symbols and intuitive pulls. Submerged in all the elements I tap into that frequency where all time is stacked upon itself in a single moment. Past, present, future moving infinitely in all directions. Everything is one divine reflection. Which is why I speak to the trees, dance with the wind, whisper to the moon and pour my loving energy into everyone - even those who aren’t ready to receive it. The idea of separation has completely dissolved in my psyche. All of nature rejoices at the human animals who have remembered and finally slowed down enough to hear its wisdom. Speak to the the elements and they will speak back, they have personalities and will each provide healing in their own way... [ a random excerpt from my journal 🙏🏼]
user_27;user_2754.jpg;Something I’m proud of for overcoming : is my fear of men. It was really confronting and anxiety inducing for most of my life. I rarely spoke to men, without being spoken to first and I would allow myself to shrink completely in their presence. I have reclaimed my own power, my own light and felt so much compassion for myself that it extended out to all beings. I can truly see everyone beyond their sex, beyond their name as the most beautiful reflection and collection of stardust in human form. I invite interactions with all people because they help me see a part of myself that may need healing. Something I’m trying to overcome: feeling like my body is good enough. I connect with my spirit self so fully sometimes that it’s hard to function in a human body. From a young age my body would trigger people and make girls bully me. And now my body gets picked apart online a lot, whether positive or negative I feel people are always deciding it’s validity or how much of myself is too much. Everyone else’s opinion on it can cloud my own. I feel most comfortable in my skin when I’m naked, I know I will keep healing this way. ✨What’s something you’re trying to heal right now? And something you’re so proud of for working through?
user_27;user_2755.jpg;You don’t know what you don’t know. You have no conception of the heart bursting love you have yet to feel. The waves of spiritual divine energy, the Earth shattering orgasms, the secrets shared in delicate whispers under bed covers, the friends you’ll meet who end up changing your life forever.. Many of us are only living moment to moment constantly reacting to what is happening around us. When we can watch our lives unfolding negatively or positively and have complete equanimity and respect for each moment in our hearts, we become the creators of our lives rather than the victims of it. Open yourself up to the truth that miracles are happening every single day. That every moment is sacred in its own way, even the painful ones. Know that some form of divinity is flowing through every person in every interaction you have. Give yourself to the experience of the blissful unknown and go beyond your current reality. 🕊What do you see?
user_27;user_2756.jpg;How I made my skin, spirit, soul and life glow... I became very still and steady. Practiced only grounding, releasing moon hatha yoga for over a year. Followed each practice with specific pranayama and meditation. Learned how to witness rather than react. Took all the love and stability I found on my yoga mat and manifested it outward into the community I surrounded myself with, the foods I was eating and every form of energy I was taking in. Only then, once I found stability and equanimity in my mind in times of tension or heat, did I begin working with Prana. Prana is our life force and it exists all around us. Many people start building Prana before they can sit still and manage the energy already flowing through them, which gives it a half life. THIS is what my Prana building practice looks like. No fast paced jumping from pose to pose but controlled intentional movement to shape the breath. This dynamic asana empowers the yogi by expanding the chest and extending the inhale. My 7 day workshop will include moon, sun and fire Hatha so anyone can get the practice they need depending on their own energy. Releasing on June 26th on HitomiNow and online for those without the app 🙏🏼 bless this lineage
user_27;user_2757.jpg;Moments in nature confront us with our inner truth, moments of stillness reveal to us what’s lingering beyond the surface. Things that we can so easily ignore by scrolling through Instagram, indulging in surface level conversation or unconsciously stuffing heavy foods down. Loud messy thoughts can be scary, but the moment we bring awareness to them they stop moving around erratically in our minds. Put your phone down, sit still, breathe in nature, allow your growth to unfold.If you want to start your spiritual journey, begin here. Begin by releasing thought patterns that have unknowingly become deeply engrained, let your walls down to the possibility that there’s something more. Something divine that lingers in the silent glimpses of stillness...

user_27;user_2760.jpg;When I walk barefoot in the forest I can feel the energy of my ancestors and their stories. Like a heartbeat beneath my feet. How alive, how sacred every part of nature is. It doesn’t matter how modern we become, we have computers, electricity, we fly in planes.. but our biology is the same as it was 100 years ago and our biological needs are the same as they were 1000 years ago. Spending time in nature & in safe community regulates our nervous system, lowers our blood pressure, eases tension in the body and releases serotonin. We must remember we are of nature, never separate from it. 📷 @erickj888 How do you feel when you’re amongst the trees?

user_27;user_2762.jpg;My mom would always tell me to let the angels know I accept their guidance and protection. She would say “ they want to help you but they won’t until you ask them to! ” with a slight sense of urgency in her voice.⁣⁣ ⁣ I talk to angels everyday now - I accept their protection, guidance and blessings. I tell them my intention in life is to be people’s mirror, to show them all the love & wisdom they carry inside. To be of service to others. To make people feel warm.⁣⁣ ⁣ So everyday becomes touched with the light of magic. I smile as I walk down the street, because in some way I know a part of everyone. I know the part of them that hurts and loves. I know the part of them that transcends the physical and exists only on the energetic plane. I see that more than any fear or judgement. A deep love warms my heart for the humans who have forgotten they are God in disguise. I ask the angels to protect and love them too..

user_27;user_2764.jpg;Me : when I remember that I am simply here to serve the collective in this game of life and am aligned in my truth, knowing that the whole universe is conspiring to my self narrative which is overflowing with love on most days ! I have been learning to fall in love with even the parts of myself that feel anxiety or sadness, knowing I am simply the witnesser ( & sometimes the creator of those feelings ) using those moments to reinforce what I feel at the core of my being : that I am capable, I am worthy and I am love. When fear continually tries to knock at your door and you respond to it by bowing down and saying “ I acknowledge you, but I will not let you in” it will stop showing up. This works for any narrative. Thoughts continue showing up because you indulge them and give them your energy. I hope you contemplate this today <3 and become aware of where your prana is flowing. So many blessings to every soul that reads this 🙏🏼
user_27;user_2765.jpg;I always feel a special sort of energy wash over me when I’m with other women. An unspoken safety & understanding. The first time I was naked with a group of women I was in high school. We were hiking and it felt intuitive to take our clothes off when we reached a secluded cliff. We meditated, we caressed each other, it was the most natural thing in the world sharing platonic intimacy and affection. Their bodies were so inexplicably beautiful and their hearts were so strong. I wanted to love their insecurities away, I wanted to heal their inner pains, show them their profound beauty, and help them come to know that every cell of their being was already pulsing with the energy of love that they were seeking. It later occurred to me, if I can love these women so deeply just as they are, maybe I can love myself just as I am. Love will always guide you home.

user_27;user_2767.jpg;The yogi is the one with their life in their hands, because they understand that the length of their breath will determine the length of their life. We use yoga asana to access the breath, to then access the mind and drop into deeper states of consciousness. The nature of the mind will always be to wander and jump from thought to thought, instead of resenting this, just work with it! Give your mind a point of focus so that it may relax and you can return to your truest state as “the observer” not the victim, not the reactor but the pure conscious energy witnessing all that is ✨ Want to go deeper with me and try a beginner Ashtanga class?

user_27;user_2771.jpg;And one day you’ll wake up and realize that you just want to feel good. That that’s enough. And your wandering mind that is constantly yearning for things outside of itself will settle into the simple truth that all of that chatter is distraction from the present moment. And unless we take time to witness what it holds we will never be truly satisfied.  We think when we have the “right” body everything will get easier, but the truth is we end up paralyzed of ruining it and obsess over our figure even more, become more self conscious, become more critical. We think that if only the people around us would change, our lives would be so much easier, instead of changing our reactions to the people around us. We prioritize so many other things in front of taking time to feel joy that we don’t even know how to invoke it. Or by the time we finally have the car we always dreamed of and the home we always imagined and the savings in the bank, were too old or too tired or still feel like there’s more to do before we can rest in simply being. Chase your dreams, pour your souls deepest desires on the canvas of life, make it colorful, make it messy, but please try and enjoy of every step of this masterpiece you’re creating. Every step of the journey IS the journey and it would break my heart to think u wished Any of it away. We’re skeletons covered in bones and flesh, our matter is infinite but life energy is fleeting. Take care of your inner and outer world. Surrender. Be 80 years old with no regrets. I wish that you can look back on this adventure and think of all the joy you let yourself feel, that you found the beauty in the mess and made the sun shine on rainy days 🌼🍓🥧 📷 @erickj888 edited using Snapseed
user_27;user_2772.jpg;I am here now. I made it to this moment which I honestly thought I would. I never thought I would get to this age (21), travel as much as I have, cultivate as much love as I have & be ThiS grateful to be alive. Today during orientation for my yoga training I was asked to share about any injuries I have. I told the teachers that I fell from a three story building and broke one heel and sprained the other. That both those injuries healed but I still feel sensitivities in my knees and wrists. Everyone was questioning what happened and giggling in disbelief. I thought about sharing how I was trying to escape someone who was trying to hurt me & assert their power over me. That I actively chose to jump in order to run away. That after I felt paralyzed and unable to feel a single thing. My throat got all quivery like when you’re trying to hold back tears. But I simply said “ it’s a long story” and smiled. This life is truly one long story. Since I’ve been in India so many random memories have been coming up and I see myself years ago. As this young person who had a light that was trying so hard to break through. Unaware of the walls I had built up and the experiences I had to release from myself. It’s been such a whirlwind of letting pieces of me die away and birthing into my truth more and more. And I want to cry because I’m so glad that girl didn’t give up. This is why I make the content that I do, because it is one of my souls missions to keep people going through the muck. To remind you that it just might be okay after all.. maybe even better than okay. Keep wishing. Keep doing the work. Keep dying. Keep birthing. As long as you have love you are safe.

user_27;user_2776.jpg;So Hum  Meaning “ I am that “. One of my favorite mantras & reminders that everything around me is an extension of me & an equal part of this entire Universe. See everything as a mirror in life, allow every moment to become an opportunity to know yourself deeper. What reactions are you having to the people around you? What gets you heated or anxious ? What makes your thoughts ripple out into stillness? Or sets your soul on fire? If you want to begin your spiritual journey, ask yourself these questions, become a master of self knowledge and begin refining your responses to be more equanimous. P.S. If you’re looking for a new coping method, simply find your breath in moments of stress and extend your exhale longer than your inhale ... ✨#breath #equanimity 📷@erickj888
user_27;user_2777.jpg;Maybe miracles don’t have to be some god willing things, maybe a miracle is as simple as the moment your awareness changes from fear to love..

user_27;user_2779.jpg;“In order for the true energy of love to penetrate your soul, your soul must be as if you had just been born. Why are people unhappy?

I’m always amazed by the power that surges up my spine when women come together, hundreds of years ago we would to sit in moon circles and bleed with one another..

user_27;user_2782.jpg;Dare to cry. Dare to scream. Dare to feel nothing. Dare to be so submerged in the present moment that every single story of your past fades away. Dare to walk into the fear.

And I have not met a single strong person who has not been wounded once. 🦋 some things that help me surrender to every moment in life without categorizing one as better than the other is extending my exhale to invoke grounding energy and forward folds. 🦋It may sound silly but forward folds were a major key in becoming the most stable, confident and free that I have felt in my entire life.

user_27;user_2783.jpg;Hitomi Angela Peraza Mochizuki.. half Japanese, half Venezuelan. When I was younger I never had Asian American role models to look up to. Having all half siblings, I didn’t have anyone that looked like me in my family. Then there was the bullying, the racial slurs, derogatory words aimed at me and my Asian lineage. ( although I’m mixed I looked much more Asian when I was younger) So it dawned on me at a very young age how pointless it is to show hatred and aversion to others based on their skin color, social class or identity.. because none of those things, we ourselves choose. We must remember, everything around us is us.. everything is composed of the same matter, the same building blocks of life. Humans look so diverse, but if you spent 5 minutes gazing deeply into the eyes of another you would end up seeing yourself. Feeling yourself. Feeling the same fire, the same love, maybe the same pain. We must free ourselves from the illusion and have compassion for all living beings. That’s the way out of suffering. | 📷 @slowenowen Edited by me. Blazer from @friendsnyc

Practice yoga with me, learn ancient breath work practices, drop into meditation and take the longest journey from your head to your heart. 💫 It feels like so many of us have been searching for a safe space to heal and a practical way to use meditation when it’s needed most - when you’re anxious, when you’re having suicidal thoughts, when you don’t feel present - these practices have saved me over and over again. I have battled with mental illness for so many years and have completely shifted everything with the polishing of my awareness. 💫 I included a Fashion and Films section because these are both incredible modalities of expression & creativity in my life. I love to tell stories and invoke feelings through film. I love dressing ethically and allowing my clothes to help me embody the energies I’m stepping into. Sometimes clothes are our second layer of skin, enabling us to feel safe walking this earth. 💫 It has coincidentally taken 9 months for my beloved @erickj888 and I to design, code, approve, film & edit for the app. On September 18, 2018 it will finally be in the palms of your hands. I can’t wait to meet you on the mat and help you say hello to your self :))) #hitominow #sept18
user_27;user_2787.jpg;We waste so much energy trying to cover up who we are when beneath every attitude is the want to be loved, and beneath every anger is a wound to be healed and beneath every sadness is the fear that there will not be enough time.  When we hesitate in being direct, we unknowingly slip something on, some added layer of protection that keeps us from feeling the world, and often that thin covering is the beginning of a loneliness which, if not put down, diminishes our chances of joy.  It’s like wearing gloves every time we touch something, and then, forgetting we chose to put them on, we complain that nothing feels quite real. Our challenge each day is not to get dressed to face the world but to unglove ourselves so that the doorknob feels cold and the car handle feels wet and the kiss goodbye feels like the lips of another being, soft and unrepeatable. - Mark Nepo

user_27;user_2789.jpg;The simplest most life changing act. Gratitude. I posted this years ago, but after all that I have learned on my path, it still continues to come down to presence. So many practices, philosophies & ways of life are centered around fine tuning our awareness to the present moment. This means accepting all that is! Through the lens of gratitude we can see everything as it truly is, a teacher, a blessing in disguise, a necessary part of our awakening and then allow ourselves to surrender deeper into the moment. | Learning to be present through dark & murky energy is not only the best way through them, but the way to get the greatest gain from those experiences. | Take 8 deep breaths & allow yourself to surrender to what your current situation is, knowing that no matter how it unfolds you can always choose peace inside. #everythingisom

user_27;user_2791.jpg;Some people aren’t familiar with the essence of love. If you were to ask me “what is Love?” I would say... Love is the moment a caterpillar emerges from a cocoon spreading its wings for the first time, Love is the gentle breeze in the summertime, Love is the moon, the sun, Love is the weightless laughter of children, Love is freedom. Love is not exclusively for lovers, but a romance to be had with the entire Universe in every moment.

user_27;user_2796.jpg;Just getting charged up ☀️ I tend to feel the strength, power, love, weakness, pain, of other living beings. It’s as if I take the form of Mother Earth and can feel every little thing that anyone is experiencing inside of me. Grounding and releasing practices have been filling my mornings. Being an empath is such a gift because it always shows me what I can do best to serve the collective and reveals to me the power of love. As long as I remember to shake off what ever energy doesn’t belong to me at the end of the day. I’m so grateful I could crii. ✨  In yoga they say the human body is a perfect yantra ( portal for higher consciousness ). The more I deepen in to practice the easier it has been to manifest wonder & magic into my life.. I feel like I am just watching everything unfold & as it happens it feels familiar like it was always written, waiting to be realized... I have been having trouble putting my thoughts/ feelings into words. But this is what’s lingering. A feeling of connection to all things. Remembering that the best way to serve the collective is to become the highest vision of myself. Thank you for being 🙏🏼

user_27;user_2799.jpg;“ I like myself better naked. I don’t mean that in a vain way. When you put clothes on, you immediately put a character on. Clothes are adjectives, they are indicators. “  When I feel disconnected in life it’s often because I am disconnected from myself and my true nature. It is because I am worn out with worrying about how I will be labeled and what things I identify with. I don’t always resonate with myself in this human body and even less so on this social media realm. Every decision I make can feel like a huge choice defining my character & being to others. What I wear, what I post, the tonality in my words... when I know my truth as a multidimensional being & wish my energy could speak for itself in all situations. So when I start to get depressed or feel lost, I know exactly what to do. I retreat into the woods, I get my feet dirty and swim naked in running water, I howl, I Let Myself Be. I let myself be completely unbounded. Its the simplest purest medicine that I feel every cell in my being rejoice to. Breathing in fresh oxygen and the scent of pine changes my entire physiology. Seeing my naked sexual, sensual body as a beautiful, whole, pleasure receiving, consciousness rising vessel rather than something to be shameful of or insecure about lifts the weight of a thousand tons off my shoulders. I am so grateful for my home in every forest, I know there is no separation from my self and all that is. | 📷 @erickj888

Me and sadness go wayyy back, as many of you know, I used to react to my sadness in the form of procrastination, self loathing or self harm.. hence the tattoo on my left arm covering the scars. My relationship to my sadness has changed drastically - rather than reacting to it and letting it affect all parts of my life- I just witness its presence, the sensations and the thoughts without worrying or wishing them away. In yoga they discern what is real by what is permanent and what is fake by what changes. This body, these thoughts, these emotions are not real. What is real is the pure consciousness - pure universal energy witnessing those changes. If you are struggling with anxiety or depression or imbalanced thoughts, I recommend making sure you aren’t nutrient deficient ( & taking vitamins if you are) and taking time every day to connect with your true essence. Because none of us are the stories we identify with (wether consciously or subconsciously) or the items in our closet or the things that have happened to us. We are so much more. Revel in your human manifestation, dance and celebrate yourself even in times of sadness. Because one universal OM brought the unique energies of who you are into being for a specific purpose. Meditate on that. I love you ❤️ thank you for helping me re write my stories
user_27;user_27108.jpg;I’ve been smiling so much lately, and that makes me smiiiile :) My favorite new additions to my life have been reading the Bhagavad Gita (as interpreted by Paramahamsa Yogananda ) and looking up things I’m curious about in the moment it crosses mi mind.. like, “Why do cats sleep so much?” “How many people diagnosed with cancer heal?” “What are the latest groundbreaking findings in the world of science?” It’s all at our fingertips 🤓& I just wanna dance between all the realms of being #35mm 📷 | @emmacheshire
user_27;user_27109.jpg;I’m in a place where I feel so capable of accomplishing every last thing that sets my heart ablaze. I’ve always been extremely driven & passionate. But at this point it feels like my entire physiology, my entire energetic alchemy is vibrating to the same frequency of those beliefs. So I not only believe “I can “ but I feel it in every cell of my body. Liberation, love, fulfillment in every cell of my body. 📷 @erickj888
user_27;user_27110.jpg;Chasing Waterfallls ✨ New Years intention is to simply keep shedding layers of attachment, of fear, of self loathing of anything that isn't serving my highest so I can continue making room for higher vibrational thoughts, actions & art :)) I jus wanna be freeee baby - what are your intentions ? Side note | this year will be very powerful for scorpios in setting big projects into motion & ideas into fruition..
user_27;user_27111.jpg;"Just a photo embodying the divine feminine within all of us 🌿I used to see ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" as words associated with only one sex but now I realize both of these energies flow through everyone. Trying to be more mindful of my diction when it comes to identity ! Who wants to be put in a box anyway 💁🏻"
user_27;user_27112.jpg;"All I see is energy Universal energy manifested in different forms There really is no ""yours"" or ""mine"" This existence is one big energy exchange No beginning no end Creation, destruction Everlasting So what will you do with this gift of right Now? What are you creating for yourself right Now? More pain, more suffering? Or are you taking steps towards more love, more joy, more abundance ? :)) LMK 🦋 📷: @erickj888"

user_27;user_27114.jpg;Ladies & Gentlemen we're floating in space... What does Right Now feel like for you? What does this moment Smell like? How does it Taste? How does it feel on your skin? Are you okay? Are you anxious or crying? Just witness.. witness this moment because it will soon pass :) let that comfort & inspire you rather than scare you 📷 @erickj888
user_27;user_27115.jpg;It's my birthday ✨so give me the Best Gift Ever and meditate today :)) I'll be frolicking around with butterflies in my hair and a smile on my face #20th #sagrising 📷 @erickj888
user_27;user_27116.jpg;I love you, I love this life. The love I have means I will stand up for what is right, the love I have means I will protect my sisters and brothers. Love isn't always just about sitting around and feeling good, love can be hard, love can be painful, love is putting others before yourself at times, love is pure devotion, love is the root, love is everything. Side note : I think we're all feeling a shift in he collective and I invite you all to arrive!! To question and to witness and to connect deeper with yourself. Connect with your intuition and share what U find :) #rituals
user_27;user_27117.jpg;When we accept our own wild beauty, it is put into perspective, and we are no longer poignantly aware of it anymore, but neither would we forsake it or disclaim it either. Does a wolf know how beautiful she is when she sleeps? Does a feline know what beautiful shapes she makes when she sits? Is a bird awed by the sound it hears when it snaps open its wings? Learning from them, we just act in our own true way and do not draw back from or hide our natural beauty. Like the creatures, we just are, and it is right... #35mm #barca #womenwhorunwiththewolves 📷@naguiyami
user_27;user_27118.jpg;Say yes baby! Say yes to life.. to Pleasssure.. To joy.. To freedom. Say yes to the sensation of taking in color, Experience the beautiful gift of sound, listen to your surroundings like music. Feel the ecstatic wind blowing on your skin. Trail your fingertips up and down your body, breathe into your pussy. Life is so full, really be there to experience it... Meet the present moment. This is what my podcast coming out tomorrow will be all about :)
user_27;user_27119.jpg;✨Truly ✨ Although I find the need to apologize for not always responding back to texts or DMs. Before I can share my love and energy with others I have to find peace and love within myself. So if I don't respond, know I'm doing the work. Staying off social media & my phone in general helps me stay SO present with myself so I can truly experience everything I'm feeling in the moment. It just feels more real. But I am content, and I am sad. I am mellow and overjoyed at the same time. I am speaking my truth and manifesting my dreams. It just all happening man! On and off this device :) I feel the oneness not only from person to person, but with the energy & events held in every moment. I feel no separation from today or tomorrow, only now. And as always I feel So Much Gratitude! I feel so loved and safe. Thank You!

user_27;user_27121.jpg;"I took time for myself and it was great and I enjoyed it and found a lot in it. Grew a lot, let go of a lot, really began to see myself and be able to say ""I love myself"". I think that alone time for growth is important, but I got too comfortable in it and was no longer growing. Started to think "" I could really be alone forever I don't need to be in any kind of romantic relationship again."" - From my notes I love and miss u... videos soon!!"
user_27;user_27122.jpg;When manifesting : 1. Always stay positive 2. Say it like it's already done 3. Do not spend time thinking about anything opposite to what you want 4. Meditate on what you want 5. See it, smell it, feel it, hear it 6. If it's real in your brain, it will be real in the physical [this is my sister Laura, she was put up for adoption when she was born and neither of us knew each other existed until a few months ago.. Aaannnd here we are! Topless, on an epic road trip, sharing so much love and energy. Might do a Q&A so ask anything you'd like to know if you're curious]

user_27;user_27125.jpg;The forest is my element. I was supercharged this past weekend but I think I'm making these trips a monthly thing.. also.. the moment you decide you aren't enough, immediately makes you not enough. You are deciding for yourself not to have what you desire. When you affirm you are enough you are allowing opportunities in. It may be scary but don't sell yourself short baby! I'm in the process of feeling worthy to receive certain love from others and I am bowing down and accepting. You are worthy of this. You are worthy of this. You are worthy of this..

user_27;user_27126.jpg;EDIT : MEETUP CANCELLED DUE TO WEATHER //IT WILL BE TOO MUDDY | 😭😭😭I'm hosting a guided meditation sesh this Friday at 6pm at Sheeps Meadow in Central Park. Come through if you wanna connect or try meditation for the first time ✨  Sending impulses of love to everyone out there after my practice this morning. We're all reflections of each other and I see absolutely no separation, I could have been you in a past life. I could have been born with your circumstances. I see you. My intention today is to really practice oneness. And allowing myself to exhale into the infinite bliss of right now. Life really lasts so much longer when you are only focused on the present. Try it! Surrender to it.
user_27;user_27127.jpg;"""What are your fears"" he asked. ""What I'd rather tell you are all the fears I've overcome..."""
user_27;user_27128.jpg;hey man, it's okay! Our past is just a story we tell ourselves. We are nothing in this moment except how we feel and what we do Now. Let go of the past, let go of your expectations on what right now should look like, let gooo. Experience every day as the new unexpected gift it is! I have no idea what I will gain or lose. I know what I feel now and the gifts I am lucky to have and I cherish them so dearly, but if it all changes I will cherish that too. Liberate yo selves ✨also love the fine witch I am growing into 🔮

user_27;user_27146.jpg;I'm excited about a lot of things in life right Now. I swear lack of passion is fatal. It's so important to prioritize doing things that simply make you feel good, that make you feel in love with life. Even something as little as looking up at the sky for a few moments. It fills me with utter joy and gives me the strength to keep pushing through sadness, it reminds me that the beauty I'm witnessing is all around me and in myself as well & that life isn't scary, it's not good or bad, it doesn't promise to be anything, it's just life. Sorry for being fricken corny!! But that's what happens when I breathe deep and bask long. #thankyou

user_27;user_27149.jpg;Lately I’ve been thinking about all I could be doing better in this life, as if theres some threshold of potential I’m so close to reaching but I have yet to break through. I think of all the different causes I support and people I want to help and I sit there crying thinking about all the love I have inside my little heart and how I just want to spread it to everyone. But then I feel too weak too many days in a row & begin to grow resentful of my inability to just break through to my full potential, I begin to feel like I am unworthy of this life for not doing the most I can. In my heart I know what is right and wrong in this world and I want to make a change. Start non profits, touch the hearts of women in third world countries and do everything I can so they feel safe and so the children there are well fed. It breaks me to think of children everywhere going to sleep hungry night after night for months in a row. I know I can make a difference & I’ve come to realize the only way to get where I want to from here is to accept where I am in this moment and appreciate all the gifts (tools) I have now. I’ll never move forward if I already feel I am too far gone. I am working on this. There is no wall. There is no threshold. There is only this moment.

user_27;user_27154.jpg;Why would you wish darkness upon yourself when the light shines all around you? This is a kind universe, and every one within it is working in your favor.

user_27;user_27157.jpg;We were hiking in the jungle and saw the sun glistening onto this little body of water, so we took our clothes off, blessed the water and floated around for a while. We basked in the sun, meditated and got high off the sound of wild birds, leaves flowing in the wind and the tiny waterfall beside us. It was the most natural thing. I felt so connected
user_27;user_27158.jpg;The universe gifts us in many different ways. It's easy to be grateful when you receive a physical gift, become acquainted with a new friend or when things are simply going your way. But take a moment to reflect on the hardest times in your life. What those events taught you, the strength you gained from them, how they led you to this exact moment in your spiritual journey. Have the awareness that whatever you're going through now you will grow from. You will grow from this, you will grow from this. Express gratitude in this moment for the struggle, for the challenge, for the hardship. Ik this is very random but when the universe is really dragging you through the mud, pushing you to your breaking point, you always rise & I want you to realize how beautiful and powerful that is
user_27;user_27159.jpg;Ok this is the last one.. sorry for the spam but I thought I might as well since I won't have wi-fi for the next 8 days after tomorrow heh all the photos taken today were with film & I'm so excited for the article to be up 😱💫 #ineedtostop #procrastinating #rn

user_27;user_27196.jpg;You are personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society you grew up in. Being vegan isn't just for tree hugging hippies ✊🏼 Animal agriculture is a subsidized Industry from which the government benefits - so although eating animal products directly leads to the main causes of death in the US ( including obesity which is a major problem rn) we are constantly told to eat more dairy and meat in ads that go around & hide what the FDA deems healthy.
