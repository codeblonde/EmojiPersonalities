user_10;user_100.jpg;Changing the how, but still doing what you love. I started teaching Pilates 3 years ago with no idea where it’d lead me but enough passion and love for helping women feel strong, healthy, and confident. Lots changed within this period of time but I think I’m still doing just that. I made so many amazing connections, met so many wonderful people and created my dream community online. I love and look forward to seeing you inside my online program and classes until we can hug and high five each other again in real life.

user_10;user_101.jpg;5 MINUTES PILATES ABS • This mini abs routine is part of Week 2 of my Self Care Challenge (if you haven’t joined the challenge...where have you been?!? 😱😜 dm me your email address to join) I love this workout because it really makes you focus on the fundamentals of Pilates, moving with correct form and breath pattern. Plus, it’s beginner friendly yet challenging for all pilates lovers. Do it for 2-3 rounds for more burn!! 😉#LETSSTARTPILATES ▫️Ab Prep x 10: Curl up on exhale, inhale to return. ▫️Obliques Prep x10 each side: Curl up and twist on your exhale. Do it from your waist, not pulling on the neck. ▫️Obliques Full x10 each side: Start legs in table top. Curl up and twist on exhale, bringing your opposite elbow to opposite knee. Focus on twisting from your waist, not just moving the elbow to knee. ▫️Scissors x10: Exhale and stretch one leg away toward the mat and pull the other leg toward your body, opening your legs like a pair of scissors. Inhale as you bring legs to center. Exhale switch legs. ▫️Hip Rolls x10: Exhale to curl tailbone under and start peeling your spine up sequentially. Inhale stay at the top. Exhale to start rolling down through the spine. ▫️Finish off with a yummy spinal stretch to release any tension.  TIP: Do these exercises more SLOWLY, focusing on good form with control and breath. 🙌🏻💘
user_10;user_102.jpg;Spring Self Care Challenge!! I am feeling very inspired to re-establish some healthy habits and practices to feel our absolute best in May.

Please note that this challenge is NOT about losing weight, doing strict fitness plans or fad diets. It is about committing to your well-being and taking the best care of yourself. To feel grounded, calm and strong in your mind + body. Especially during crazy times like this! 🤗
user_10;user_103.jpg;"Creating a body that you love starts with, number☝🏻, respecting your body today. Not when you lose weight or not if you work out everyday. When we shift our focus from self criticizing, judging and finding all the things that are “wrong”, we can finally start to transform. We are better able to care for ourselves; and in turn, we feel better. That feeling becomes the ultimate inspiration to make healthy, happy choices. I've seen it in my own life that you CAN’T hate yourself to a body and life you love. And you CAN have a hot body without crazy fitness and diet regimes. Transforming your body begins with connection and education and self respect. And loving your body is what comes from the process, not the result. #LETSSTARTPILATES"
user_10;user_104.jpg;Your mindset matters. Now more than ever as there is so much anxiety, crazy fitness culture and body image triggers around us 24/7.

I’m here to support you in getting there. 🙌🏻#LETSSTARTPILATES | letsstartpilates.com

user_10;user_107.jpg;Simple works the best - when you move with the right form. This side-lying exercise is so much more than just kicking the leg back and forth. If taught in the right way, it lengthens and strenghtens the legs, core and the back body. It’s also one of the best whole body exercises you can do.

user_10;user_1011.jpg;"""You are not what you eat, you are what you digest.” as soon as I heard this, the lightbulb went off in my head like 💡Last year I dove deep into learning about gut health and improving my digestion👩🏼‍🔬Before I was the biggest bloat queen and thought it was just normal. But adopting a few daily habits REALLY improved my gut health, gave me a happy bloat-free belly, and the clearest, glowy skin I’ve ever had.👌🏻💘 Here’s my top 3 tips for improving your digestion: 1. Live according to your biological clock. Did you know that our digestive system has a bedtime too? Night time is when our bodies go into a deep cleaning and rejuvenation mode. Try having an early light dinner to support your bodies natural rhythm. 2. Probiotics +prebiotics in the morning. A healthy gut is at the core of all wellness – literally the gut is in our core. I started drinking warm lemon water + taking probiotics in the morning since summer. I fully trust and recommend @seed probiotics to all my friends! Get %15 off with code HANDE15 ✨Their formula support your whole-body health from your immune system, gut health, skin, and heart health. #ad #accountable 3. Daily Pilates practice. When you breathe, move and stretch, you stimulate the internal organs and increase the blood flow. In pilates we move the spine in different directions that create a sense of space in the body. This space gives you digestive comfort and reduce bloating. And of course you get a stronger core and better posture as a bonus. 💁🏼‍♀️ What is one small step you can take today to be healthier? Every day when you wake up, remind yourself of your goals, what you want, and commit to being YOUR best self. It’s never too late to start living a healthier, happier life!"

user_10;user_1015.jpg;"“If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place” my fav quote by Eckhart Tolle. Yes, we all want to look good on the outside. But we never feel ""good enough"" on the outside until we deal with the inside (our mindset, beliefs, feelings.) The best and most transformative way to do this has been meditation for me. I thought I can never meditate because my mind would never stop. Good news is you don't need to completely silence or control your mind to start meditating. That is why it's called a ""practice”. Do you have a meditation practice? 💘💭 If you want my meditation tips for beginners, I wrote this blogpost for you: https://www.user_10.com/blog/meditation-for-beginners"
user_10;user_1016.jpg;HOW TO STAY MOTIVATED 🙋🏼‍♀️💭 Last week I had a conversation with a friend who was feeling unmotivated to workout. She hasn’t been finding time to workout. And for that, she feels guilty. She's been feeling bad about her body. Her energy is low. She wants to get out of this rut and start to feel better. She can't figure out why she can't just get it together and stick with her workouts.  Can you relate?  I do! I felt this exact same way for years. And I hear from women in similar situations every week. If you've been wanting to improve your fitness, body image, and overall health, but haven't been able to make progress, I'm guessing you're doing one of these 4 mistakes: ▫️Believing that workouts must be long, exhausting, and sweaty in order to bring results. ▫️Making it up as you go instead of following a clear, easy-to-follow plan. ▫️Trying to do it alone...without support, guidance, and community. ▫️Relying on self-hate (or disgust) instead of self-love as a form of motivation.  If you're making any of these things, you will continue to feel stuck. Want to get un-stuck? I’m sharing 3 simple steps you can take today in my new blogpost at www.user_10.com/blog. 👈🏻💖
user_10;user_1017.jpg;"FOOD MINDSET 💫 Have you ever started a diet, felt anxious/guilty around food, beat yourself up for eating something ""bad”? Yeah, same. 💁🏼‍♀️ I normally avoid this topic. It’s so personal and may bring up a lot of emotions. But I have to share a few things that changed my mindset. Since I switched to more mindful, intuitive and plant-based eating, I feel & look the healthiest I’ve been. My energy and gut health is %100 better. My skin is clearer. Swipe for some simple guidelines you can apply to create a better, more peaceful relationship with food."
user_10;user_1018.jpg;WORKOUTS YOU LOVE 💁🏼‍♀️💖 When you work out in a way that you love, your body loves you back! Before I commited to Pilates, I used to force my body into high intensity workouts. I tried BBG, bootcamps, lifting weights… Those workouts felt like punishment. And I DREADED them. My focus used to be on how much I sweat and how many calories I can burn. This mindset never gave me the body & life I desired. But changing my mindset and finding the type of workouts I really LOVED did. ❤️ If I did it, you can do it too. You can love the way you move, look and feel without killing yourself. Have you found your best workout routine yet? What are your biggest problems around exercise? I am all ears!

user_10;user_1024.jpg;MY PILATES TRANSFORMATION | As a bootcamp girl in my previous life, I thought a “real workout” meant dripping in sweat and spending hours at the gym until you’re out of breath. I would tear myself apart with high intensity workouts doing burpees until I’d collapse to the floor, hating every second of my workouts. 😭 The rest of the day I'd be an anxious eater, worrying about “undoing” my hard work by eating the “wrong” foods, too tired to cook, uninspired to go out with friends.  Then I realized there should be another way... I started doing Pilates consistently because I loved how I felt during and after each session. Like a zen goddess. 💭🧘🏼‍♀️✨Not like a hot sweaty mess, but calm, strong and healthy. That feeling became my motivation to exercise. When you love what you do, you do it more consistently. That’s when you see the results you want both in your body and mind. 🙌🏻Read the rest of this post to learn how Pilates can transform your body & life on my blog www.user_10.com 🤗 #LETSSTARTPILATES | outfit: @ourdoorvoices #doingthings pc: @praaaise __ #pilatestransformation #pilatesinspiration #pilateseveryday #pilatesathome #pilatesforbeginners #matpilates #mindfulliving #themindfultime #bodykindness #bekindtoyourmind #nondietapproach #intuitivemovement #mindfuleating #mindfulmovement #bodypositivefitness #beyourownmotivation
user_10;user_1025.jpg;We can’t hate ourselves into a happier life and healthier body. Have you ever noticed how you talk to yourself in your head? We can be so mean and judging. When I started practicing mindfulness, I learned to catch those thoughts and choose NOT to believe in them. 💭 This helped me become a better version of myself and transformed all my relationships from work to family life. One simple way to practice this has been daily meditation, especially loving kindness meditations. It can be just 5 minutes, but it will still have a big impact on how your day goes. 🙌🏻💘 Three books that I love on this are: Lousie Hay’s You can change your life, Marianne Williamson’s A return to love, and the Headspace guide to meditation and mindfulness. #LETSSTARTPILATES __ #mindfulliving #themindfultime #bodykindness #bekindtoyourmind #nondietapproach #intuitivemovement #mindfuleating #mindfulmovement #bodypositivefitness #joyfulmovement #moveandmeditate #beyourownmotivation #selfcareideas #selfcaretips #selfcareclub pc: @jessrachelsharp
user_10;user_1026.jpg;Once you move because you love yourself, it’s so much easier to stay motivated & commit to your health and happiness. 💭 I shared this with my email bffs this week: If you are struggling with motivation to exercise, find your WHY. Why is movement important to you? Why do you want to workout? To “burn off” meals? OR Is it to feel better, stronger and create your own best body? If we want to be truly healthy inside and outside, we need to embrace all the other good reasons for making movement a part of our lives. This way of thinking has transformed my relationship with movement.

user_10;user_1032.jpg;#lettertomyyoungerself ❤️ Girl, stop! Stop overthinking what you eat and how much you workout. Stop taking advice from random health & fitness accounts with zero credentials. Stop copying her unrealistic meals in her “what I eat in a day” video. You don’t need to see another workout video or a food pic on IG. You don’t really want to be skinny or have a six pack. Because those things are NOT going to give you real peace or happiness. You’ll still be you when you’re 10 pounds lighter. Stop trying to workout like her. Stop trying to be her. This is step 1.

user_10;user_1033.jpg;"You know when you want to get healthier and happier, there are endless ways to approach this. Getting back into an exercise routine, going on a “diet”, following all the “should's” and setting goals.  All of these things tend to focus on what you can control outside. Like the food you eat, or how much you workout. But the real transformation happened for me when I realized there’s a missing piece: what’s going on INSIDE, our mindset.  One example I shared is how we can rethink cheat days and desserts. What if ""dessert"" meant taking care of ourselves instead of binging on sugary, junk food? Don’t get me wrong.

user_10;user_1035.jpg;"ON NOT FEELING ENOUGH: this quote reminded me the book that completely changed my perception and mindset about life: ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.  We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.  As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” Marianne Williamson from A Return To Love.

user_10;user_1039.jpg;I remember trying matcha latte for the first time at a cafe and I HATED it 😅 I’m a big green tea drinker, but matcha was just too strong. I knew about all the amazing health benefits of matcha so I kept working on my own little recipe at home. Here’s my latest simple recipe I loveee:  Matcha Coconut Latte Recipe 🥥 Ingredients: ½ cup hot water, ½ cup organic coconut milk, 1 teaspoon matcha tea powder Optional: Add some cinnamon or honey as a natural sweetener 🍵  Method: Add 1 tsp matcha powder to half of the hot water in a mug. Whisk the powder and water together to create a green mix. I use a frother, makes everything super easy. After heating your coconut milk, add it to the mix and the remaining hot water to the mix and stir. If you have a frother, go ahead and froth to your desired texture. You can also use a mixer like Nutribullet to make it super frothy and mixed well. ✨Enjoy in the morning or afternoon for a calm, zen energy. ___ #matchalatterecipe #matchalovers #matchalatte #wellnessbloggers #pilatesteacher #healthyhabits #mindfulliving #mindfulfitness #healthyliving #simplifyyourlife #healthymindhealthybody #wholebodyhealth #mindbodygram
user_10;user_1040.jpg;One thing I used to be so confused about was... healthy snacking. [#WasaPartner ] What to eat before/after a workout, all the rules, “should’s” and “don’ts”. And as much as I love fancy chia puddings with 6 different layers, I just don’t have the time and patience to make that happen in real life. 🙋🏼‍♀️ And over here, I only have one rule: Snack 👏🏻 simple! 👏🏻 It’s all about quick and easy snacks like nuts & fruits I can grab and go. I’ve also been loving the new gluten free crispbreads from @wasausa. Makes the best snack with some hummus, veggies or fruit on top! You can find all of them in your local @WholeFoods. Take a peek at my stories to see all the other options they have - so good! #SnackSimple #SimplyWasa

user_10;user_1042.jpg;Proud of my body for being strong & letting me move with love.🧘🏼‍♀️✨ I’m sharing this with you because I want YOU to be proud of your body too. Love yourself even if your body doesn’t look exactly how you want it to be yet. Because this is where we start. We start RIGHT NOW. Not when you lose weight, not when your thighs or your waist is smaller. We eat well and move mindfully because it feels GOOD. We exercise because we want to look & be our best selves both in the mind and body. And it all starts with that one little step you take today. 🙌🏻 #LETSSTARTPILATES ____ #movemindfully #pilateseveryday #longleanlines #pilatesinstructor #pilatesstrong #pilatesfit #mindbodygram #letsstartyoga #wellnessbloggers #pilatesteacher #healthyhabits #mindfulliving #mindfulfitness #healthyliving #simplifyyourlife 🎵 Aime by Rook1e.
user_10;user_1043.jpg;One thing I’ve been really focusing on these days is gut + skin health.✨ I live a pretty healthy lifestyle and do things that help me feel my best everyday. Like movement, mindful eating and meditation. But if you’re curious to learn 5 things that REALLY improved my digestion, gave me a clearer glowing skin, and a happy stomach, then you should definitely read my new blogpost – 🔗 link in bio.  Probiotics is on top of that list, no surprise. But it completely transformed my digestion.I love and recommend @seed probiotics to all my friends bc this is the first probiotic backed up by real science. (No really, their Chief Scientist chaired the United Nations World Health Organization Expert Panel that came up with the official definition of 'probiotics'). As a wellness lover and subscriber, I have to tell you that this sh*t works… literally. 🙊 Use code HANDE15 to get a discount if you want to try them.

user_10;user_1045.jpg;"Let me tell you the story of a small and sickly child born in 1883, Germany. This little kid suffered from asthma, rickets, and rheumatic fever. When he decided to heal himself and overcome his problems, he studied anatomy, started bodybuilding, wrestling, yoga, gymnastics, and martial arts. 🧠 He then designed his own exercise method, which we now call Pilates.  This method helps strengthen and balance the entire body, improve posture, flexibility and coordination. He healed himself. He created a body that was ""anatomical ideal,” and even posed as a model for anatomy charts. 😳🙌🏻 He also invented equipments using spring resistance like the tower you see behind me. You know who this child is? What an incredible, inspiring human... I practice his exercises with no equipment daily at home for a strong mind, body and soul. Once a week I love taking a group class at @mightypilates #gifted The best thing is they combine classical Pilates into fun, intense workouts. If you wanna try a class you can get $20 off with code HANDE20. (expires soon, so take advantage while you can) Power Pilates with Kim is my fav at the Marin location. Open to Pilates dates with you!

user_10;user_1046.jpg;"When I first moved to the USA, I had no friends or family here, everything was so new and different, and I was very homesick. I buried all my worries and anxieties away by eating mindlessly.  That’s also when social media was getting obsessed with food. I’d see lots of healthy food pics but also very triggering stuff like ""cheat meals"" and ""burning off calories” from so called fitness influencers and gurus…  All of which gave me a very unhealthy relationship with food and body image. AND whole lot of health problems like digestive issues, allergies, and around 18 pounds/8 kilos.  4 years later, I am now my happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been. I educate myself. I pay attention to who I follow and what I consume on IG.  Food is only one piece of our overall wellbeing. But it can be so powerful, truly healing! 🌿 If you have the right mindset.  I now cook most of my meals at home. When I need to grab something quick & healthy, I've a few favorite places like @projectjuice #gifted. Their vegan caesar salad is everything, the sauce is insane. 🙌🏻 Head over to my stories to see what I did with the Thai salad – another favorite!  Curious to hear if you can relate to any of this?

user_10;user_1048.jpg;Self Love & (Healthy) Weight Loss | Being all for self love, holistic health, body positivity and accepting every size and body...does not mean I don’t also think about losing weight or getting on the scale.  I intentionally avoid this topic bc it can be so controversial and even triggering for a lot of us. 🙋🏼‍♀️ And I’m at a point now where I made peace with the scale and am using it as a tool to get data. (Not as a tool to assess my worth or ruin my day bc of a number)Which feels so liberating! I think my point is: You can love yourself while wanting to lose weight, get healthier and more confident in your body. ✨ You can be kind to yourself while striving to feel AND look your best every single day. 💞 This has been on my mind lately so wanted to share it openly with you.

user_10;user_1057.jpg;Let’s be real - I didn’t know if I can even pull this off. If you look at it, I had so many “disadvantages”  I didn’t know how to write a book or an ebook. 🤷🏼‍♀️English is not even my first language. I wasn't fit enough or young enough to create a guide like this. I wasn’t sure if people would love or hate it. 😳I didn’t have enough money to hire a professional studio or a team... What I had was a dream and my heart full of passion and excitement to share everything that changed my life, and hopefully help another girl get healthier + happier! Despite all the reasons why I would fail, I didn’t. I’ve made it!  You never know what you can achieve until you try it! I mean 👏🏻REALLY 👏🏻 try. Start with one step. Start with fear. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start with voice trembling but start. Start and don't stop.

user_10;user_1059.jpg;I get asked a lot about my diet and what I normally eat in a day.  Truth is my food is not pretty like 99% of the time 😄🙋🏼‍♀️and nutrition is not my area, so it’s not my place to tell you what you should/shouldn’t eat.  And IG can be a tricky place if you start comparing your food and/or portions to others (which I did for years 😔) So, be mindful of that and take whatever you see here as inspiration only.  It took me so long to figure out what was right for my body. I eat mostly plant based, + eggs and fish, and eating as mindfully as possible. 🧘🏼‍♀️💭 I’m really loving intermittent fasting and eating according to our bodies circadian rhythm.  I highly recommend the book “Change your schedule, change your life”, linked on my favorites page on my website (scroll all the way down for the books.) Has anyone read it?

Ab prep ( aka ab curl up) 2. Obliques prep 3. Hundred prep 5 counts of inhales and exhales, do as many sets as you can 4.

user_10;user_1061.jpg;"My workouts used to feel like a chore and punishment.😳 I thought I “should” be doing high intensity workouts (even if I hated them) until I'm dripping in sweat after a workout to see results.

user_10;user_1067.jpg;"🧘🏼‍♀️💭MY FITNESS STORY  I used to believe you needed to be dripping in sweat after a workout to see results. Just do lots of jumps, burpees, and cardio, spend hours at the gym until you’re out of breath to see results, right? Well that didn’t work for me.  I hated working out. I hated eating healthy. I started comparing my body to “#fitspo” pics on IG, feeling like a fitness failure! It took me 4 years of trial and error, research, and studying movement and exercise science, to confidently be able to say…  working out harder is not the only—or even the most effective—way to become the healthiest, fittest and strongest version of yourself.🙅🏼‍♀️ Let's forget about “no pain no gain” and ""push through the pain"" mindset to become the best versions of ourselves. 👊🏻💓 (In fact, stop doing that if you hate every minute of it, ok!?)

user_10;user_1075.jpg;💭”Change happens through movement and movement heals.” 💓  Pilates healed my relationship with my body and my mindset about working out. #letsstartpilates It empowered me to become a happier and healthier version of myself!  Is there a practice or movement that is healing for you too? Share with me below! 🤗  outfit: @outdoorvoices @ovbayarea #doingthings

user_10;user_1077.jpg;New Healthy Morning Routine ☺️🧘🏼‍♀️finally nailed it down! I wake up around 6:30am, drink warm lemon water, do 20-30 minutes Pilates, meditate & have breakfast. And I feel soooo accomplished and ready for the day. Especially getting my exercise in first thing in the morning makes me feel fab!! 💁🏼‍♀️💫 Tell me about your routines and how you like to start the day to feel happy and healthy. 🤗 #letsstartpilates #mindfulmornings
user_10;user_1078.jpg;Body Confidence + Self Love 💭🧘🏼‍♀️I thought I was really good at accepting and loving my body, but honestly I still find myself criticizing and judging a million things that are “wrong” about it in the mirror.  The funny thing is I’ve been both heavier and skinnier than my current shape. And yet, I was never satisfied with myself. So, I know it’s not about changing things outside, it’s all about my mindset and how I talk with myself in my head. 🧠💆🏼‍♀️ Practicing loving kindness meditation really helps me get out of that negative space to a happier and healthier mindset. I wanted to share this little exercise that always helps me:  Go in front of a mirror and say this to yourself at least 3 times everyday: I LOVE AND ACCEPT MYSELF EXACTLY AS I AM.  The best thing you can do for yourself is stop criticizing, and start loving no matter what! You 👏🏼 are 👏🏼 in power 👏🏼. As always, I’m here if you wanna chat, comment or DM me. So much love for you all! 🤗  ps: obsessed with these new Freeform leggings and bra from @outdoorvoices, get $20 off for your first order w/ the link on favorites page on my website! #doingthings #OVofficial @ovbayarea
user_10;user_1079.jpg;MINDFUL MONDAYS💭🤗🌱 started leaving my phone in the kitchen when I go to sleep 💤 this way I don’t reach out for my phone first thing when I wake up (scrolling on IG or checking emails used to give me so much anxiety) Now I wake up, meditate and eat breakfast before I check my phone. The benefits that I’ve seen in just one week: better sleep, less anxiety, feeling more rested and calm all day🧘🏼‍♀️☺️ If you experience poor sleep or anxiety in the mornings give this a try, it really helps me! 💓wearing: @outdoorvoices @ovbayarea #doingthings #ovambassador

user_10;user_1084.jpg;MINDFUL MONDAYS 🧘🏼‍♀️🌿💭 This week, my healthy living goal is to eat, move, work + teach more mindfully. Practicing mindfulness with everything I do has improved my overall happiness and health so so much. And I truly believe we need to care about the wellbeing of our minds + souls as much as our physical fitness. Two amazing opportunities to join me in practicing this together: 1. FREE mindfulness meditation class tonight 1/28 at 5:30pm @thepadstudios 2. Mindful Mat Pilates series with me on Sundays at 11:30am @thepadstudios 🤗🧘🏼‍♀️Excited to see and hug some of you very soon!! xx

user_10;user_1092.jpg;hey hi hello! our new weekly pilates move is cat stretch #letsstartpilates 💭🧘🏼‍♀️ I do this stretch almost everyday and absolutely love it 🤩 It’s the best thing after working on your laptop all day, really good for your back and mobilizing that lovely spine.  Start with knees directly under hip bones, hands under shoulders. Slowly round your spine up like a little cat🐱, then unravel your spine back to a tiny little extension. Focus on stretching your back, be careful not to go into too much extension. Repeat 5 times.🧡 Do this little move and let me know how you feel! I’d love to know if you have a favorite stretch, share it with me below! 🤗  wearing my favorite OV Tech Kit that feels like butter on my skin ☁️ @outdoorvoices #OVofficial #doingthings  #catstretch #spinestretch #mindfulmovement #pilatesflow #pilatesfit #beginnerpilates #pilateseveryday #yogastretch #pilatesbody #pilatesathome #letsstartyoga #wellnessblogger #wellnessjourney #blogilates #moveoftheday #mindfullifestyle #pilatesteacher #pilatesinstructor #pilatesworkout #pilatescommunity #matpilates #athomeworkout
user_10;user_1093.jpg;The one daily movement each of us can benefit from is the hip rolls. Especially if you sit down, drive or work on your computer a lot, you need this in your life ☺️ Here’s a quick how to: start feet hip distance apart, knees bent, exhale to slowly roll the hips up into a pilates bridge.  Really focus on mobilizing your spine, keep abs + glutes engaged and repeat 5 times.🧡 I'm thinking of sharing weekly Pilates moves you can do with me anywhere, anytime. We can even have our own little hashtag #letsstartpilates 💭🧘🏼‍♀️Would that be helpful?

user_10;user_1094.jpg;I no longer label myself as vegan, keto, paleo, or any other way. I’m just done experimenting 😅 Now I aim to be an intuitive and a mindful eater 🙋🏼‍♀ this gives me the best mindset about food 🌱 I think whatever type of lifestyle you choose, you can make it more mindful. It can be as simple as setting the intention: “Today I will eat more mindfully.” It’s so powerful!

user_10;user_1099.jpg;over the weekend I shared my experience with anxiety and self loathing after a day of eating not so healthy (think fries, burgers, ice cream, pie all in one day oops🙈) don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with these foods itself and I very much enjoyed every bite. BUT it's NOT okay to sit in a negative mindset and beat yourself up about it afterwards. Healing starts when you love and accept yourself unconditionally, choose to eat mindfully next time and move on! 🧡💕None of us is perfect and eat well 100 percent all the time.

user_10;user_10132.jpg;"HOW TO MAKE MATCHA LATTE 🍵 (my first video production 🤣) but you guys asked for it, so here it is! 🤗 it’s super simple and nutritious. I drink it everyday for energy, glowing skin, hair and some ZEN🧘🏼‍♀💕 〰️ what you need: 1 cup hot water 1/2 cup almond milk or any milk of your choice (I use @califiafarms) 1 tsp matcha powder (my fav is @myencha) 1 tsp collagen powder (use discount code “user_10"" for @furtherfood) 1tsp honey, to taste 〰 method: Add boiling water, almond milk, matcha powder, collagen powder to a @thenutribullet or high-speed blender. Blend on high until smooth for about 30 seconds. The mixture will be frothy. Pour into mugs and stir in honey to taste :) #matchaaddict #howtomakematcha #matchalatte #matchalover #matchalove #wellandgoodeats"

user_10;user_10167.jpg;"💭 Thinking a lot about freedom lately and wanted to share one of my favorite quotes by Tim Ferris (🤓go ready any of his books) 🙌🏼 “True freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It's possible to have financial and time freedom but still be caught in the rat race. Can you have a two hour dinner with friends without getting anxious? Can you get used to a small town where all businesses takes a siesta for two hours in the afternoon and then close at 4pm? Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge yourself and others. Get out of your ""busy"" trap and heal the illness of being busy. ” 〰️ Anyone feeling this? 🙋🏼‍♀️"
