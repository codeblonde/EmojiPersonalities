user_11;user_110.jpg;"Encourage change... motivation and inspiration towards a vegan lifestyle and plantbased diet. - All types of activism are great in their own way. Some people need the shock of *reality* to actually be willing to give up meat and dairy. While others slowly need to ease into by being inspired to eat more plantbased. - But one thing I don't agree with is shaming others for not being vegan. This will just make people anti-vegan and less likely to give it a try. - Isn't it better to encourage people to make lifestyle and diet changes that decrease consumption and use of animal products..... whether it's through facts, statistics, information or encouragement and motivation? - 100 000 people limiting their consumption of animal products to minimal amounts is ""better"" than 1000 people never eating animal products. - The world is never going to go fully vegan.... this is not something I believe unfortunately. Even if it makes me incredibly mad how animals are treated... how they are seen as only food. Insignificant and creatures without feelings. Forgetting that animals are INCREDIBLY smart, have feelings and the mass killing of animals for food is like an actual horror story. - But with this being said... i don't think the world will go vegan. But the world can infact - and should decrease consumption of dairy products. Now a days there are alternatives and you can get nutrition from plants.... which should be the base of everyone's diet. - But as a vegan you can't forget that some cultures are very meat based in their diets. Some individuals have illnesses or food allergies which mean they need to eat animal products to be healthy and for others they neither have the time or money to solely eat vegan. Something I have come to learn is that choosing to be a vegan is a privilege not everyone has. - Yes plants are cheap. But they also require prep which not everyone has. - If someone doesn't have any nutrition info they might not know they need b12 or how to eat a healthy vegan diet. - Be kind to others. Don't scare people from trying to go vegan. Instead help, motivate, inspire, educate them on the facts."
user_11;user_111.jpg;Whats your favourite veggie to roast? 😍 Simple side dish... or part of your main meal. Roasted broccoli with a tahini lime dressing. - RECIPE: - Chop broccoli into small florets. Preheat oven to 220C. In a bowl mix together 2tbsp neutral oil (or olive oil), 2tbsp soya sauce, 1tbsp maple syrup, 3 crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp ginger powder, some lime juice. Mix together. Pour over the broccoli florets, so it is fully coated. Place the broccoli in a greased baking form. Pour over some bread crumbs or sesame seeds. - Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, turning the pieces over after half the time. - In the meantime, make the mustard dressing: You can make a lemon vinegrette to top the broccoli with. But I'm not a huge fan of oil based dressings so instead typically use oatcream or tahini as the base of my salad dressings! - Mix together tahini, lime juice, little bit of maple syrup, pinch of salt and water! - This broccoli works great with some rice noodles and crispy tofu 😋 - - #plantbasedfood #plantbased #food #veganfoodspot #vegetables #vegetarisk #summerfood #summer #vegetarian #vegetarianrecipes #vegan #wfpb #wfpbrecipes #recipe #recipes #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #lunch #dinner #veganlunch #vegandessert #buzzfeedtasty #buzzfeedfood #mittbuffe #wholefoods #buddhabowl #bestofvegan
user_11;user_112.jpg;"15 minute meal idea! Quesadillas 🥙 - These can be made in 5 minutes, depending what you fill them with! A delicious filling idea.... - Boil sweet potato cubes. Allow to cool.

On one half of the tortilla add some sweet potato mash. Some of chickpeas and soy pieces. Tomato pieces. Sweet corn. Optional some spinach and grated vegan cheese. Fold the other half of the tortilla over. Press down and cut in half so you have two ""quesadillas"". Repeat with more tortilla bread. - Fry the quesadilla in a little oil until crispy on both sides.

user_11;user_113.jpg;"A salad can come in many different forms..... 🥦 - Is there such a thing as a perfect relationship with food....? No there's not. Food and eating is not an assignment, there's nothing perfect about it. And there should be no ""cheating"" involved in a balanced diet ... cheating implies you are doing something bad or wrong, when infact no foods are bad or wrong to eat. - There are dy to day variations as well as both internal and external factors that affect hunger, fullness and what you eat. - Eating past comfortable fullness.... it happens🍪 - Eating a whole 200g chocolate bar in one go... it happens🍫 - Forgetting to eat a meal and ending up super hungry and HANGRY .. it happens. 🍞 - Not eating any vegetables for the whole day or week .... it happens🍏 - Drinking more coffee than water somedays.... it happens🧊 - Don't put focus on the ""perfect diet"" or way of eating. It doesn't exist. Instead make food choices based on what YOU want to eat and enjoy eating. The food that makes you feel good. Food that energizes you, satisfies you and food you want to eat. - No put forcing yourself to eat foods you don't like, no matter the nutritonal value🍭 - You know your body best. Find your own balance and don't chastise yourself for being human. Food is something that provides enjoyment, happiness and comfort and your should never feel guilty for eating and enjoying food. - There is no falling off the bandwagon or ""I'll start again on Monday"". Find your healthy lifestyle that allows all types and amounts of food. Then you allow the day to day variation and know you are human. - Forget the INSTA-diet or other diets and food rules. Ask yourself how do those rules make you feel? Are they helping you or keeping you restricted? Does food and food guilt take up alot of your time and energy?... Food freedom doesn't happen overnight... but you have to start someday.

user_11;user_114.jpg;Tofu-zucchini rolls 😍😍😍🙌 This is a recipe you HAVE to try! Yeeesss I mean it😉 It was actually my sister who inspired me to make this dish a few weeks ago, but she made a non vegan version. And well, when I hear about that I just know I HAVE to veganize it for myself. - HOW TO: 1-2 zucchinis, sliced thinly - vertically 250g tofu 150g vegam cream cheese 1 jar of sundried tomatoes (minus the oil) 400ml crushed tomatoes Bread crumbs Salt, pepper, oregano - Clean the zucchini and using either a potato peeler or cheese slicer, slice thinly. Place on a plate, sprinkle over some salt and set aside for 30 minutes. - In a bowl, mix together tofu (firm type), sundried tomatoes (diced), cream cheese, salt and a GENEROUS amount of black pepper and oregano. Optional, a little sprinkle of garlic salt. - After 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 200C. Pour a little tomato sauce into the bottom of a greased form and spread out - Pat away the salt from the zucchini and with a tablespoon, place some of the filling 1/5 of the way into the zucchini slice. (Tip, 1 tbsp is enough filling for each pieces) Then roll and place in the form (with the edges on the bottom!) - Repeat until you are out of zucchini, filling or space! - Pour over the tomato sauce, add breadcrumbs as well as more salt, black pepper and oregano. OPTIONAL, some grated vegan cheese. Also optional, a drizzle of olive oil for flavour! - Bake in the oven around 25-30 minutes. - Best eaten warm, but works fine cold 😍😍😋 - Don't forget to TAG me or MENTION me if you try my recipes! - - #vegan #veganfood #veganfoodspot #veganinspiration #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #lunch #lowcarb #plantbasedfood #plantbased #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #vegetables #vegetarisk #zucchini #wholefoods #wfpb #buzzfeedtasty #lunch #dinner #summerfood #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #mealprep
user_11;user_115.jpg;Being an adult means adding a chocolate (proteinbar) to your oatmeal just because you can... 😋🤫 - If anyone is a long time follower you may know that i used to do this in the past. And ate a whole lot of proteinbars..... 😅 - Now a days? Not so much. Granted I personally don't find there are that many tasty vegan protein bars on the market... well until @barebells created 2 vegan ones which are the best I have tasted! - Are proteinbars necessary? No. You can and should eat regular food to get your protein. - But as an on the go snack or postworkout snack, they may be a good option or alternative. However you can of course make cheaper protein snacks at home if you have the time.🍽 - Some call protein bars just protein enriched candy bars..... which is true for some. Infact, some (non vegan) proteinbars use collagen as the protein to make it seem like alot of protein but collagen is not a complete source of protein as whey or casein would be (**dairy i.e not vegan). So it's just a waste of money. Some proteinbars also have almost as much sugar as protein which seems a little contradictory....🍯 - If you enjoy proteinbars... eat them. But don't get caught up in the protein hype and don't forget that your body needs carbohydrates and fat to function properly. So... if you're going to eat them. Try not to use them instead of actual food which will provide you with more nutrients🥦🥦🍌 - As a sweet snack.. go for it. But no, if you're craving a brownie or cake then a PB most likely won't satisfy that craving 😉😉 - - #snack #oatmeal #breakfast #veganbreakfast #wholefoods #plantbased #veganbreakfast #snacks #healthyfood #buzzfeedfood #barebells #vegan #veganinspiration #veganfoodspot #buzzfeedfood #buzzfeedvegetarian #vegetariskt #buddhabowls #coconutbowl #wholefoodsvegan #proteinbar

user_11;user_118.jpg;Summer/midsummer dessert for 2 😍😍😍 - So.... it's midsummer's ever tomorrow and maybe you are in need of a simple and quick throw together,then I got you covered 🙏 - This recipe can be adapted in many ways, so listed below are some adaptions! - Crumbled digestives in the base Fresh strawberries A mix of whipped soya cream and vegan cream cheese. (Optional add some vanilla or cardamom to the Mix!) Homemade lemon curd And repeat! - This is a top notch delicious dessert and can be varied by: Using actual crumbled pie base. Unfortunately there is no vegan premade tart base and I didn't feel like making my own. So I settled for biscuits. - You can also make a cheesecake base my mixing together crumbled digestives and melted margarine. - And to make it completely sugar free or lower in fat use plain or vanilla flavoured soya yoghurt instead of cream 🍦 - LEMON CURD RECIPE: 100G sweetener 2-3tbsp syrup 1tbsp corn starch Juice from 2 lemons & some zest 120ml oatmylk - Whisk together the sweetner and cornstarch in a pot. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a boil/simmer for 5-8 minutes whisking until it thickens! Don't forget to taste test and adjust sweetness and bitterness.

user_11;user_119.jpg;Reminder. Food doesn't have to be eaten solely for nutritional aspects... it can be chosen and eaten just out of taste and enjoyment. 🥞  You don't need to always choose whole grains. It's fine to eat refined foods and processed foods.🥯 - You don't always have to choose sugar free. A little sugar isn't unhealthy.🍒 - You don't have to mix in and hide vegetables in everymeal you eat. You can infact eat a meal with no greens.🥦 - You don't have to exercise just because you ate X or Y. Neither do you need to compensate or restrict afterwards or before eating X or Y. Food should be enjoyed regardless of nutritional value.  You don't need to always read the nutritional value of foods... you can infact just eat a food and enjoy it without seeing numbers 🐿  You don't have to choose the sorbets or sugar free ice-cream this summer🍧  You don't have to go on a diet or restrict or cleanse or detoxify just because it is summer🍪  You don't have to eat just one portion or serving of food... you can and should eat until satisfaction🍟  You don't and shouldn't compare your intake to anyone else. We are all unique and require different energy amounts🌮  You can and should order what you want when you go out to eat. Also if you do have a summer holiday.... enjoy eating out and trying different foods. - Life is more than food and numbers 🙏 Yes food is nourishment. But it is so much more than that as well. - Less focus on perfect eating. More focus on eating food you enjoy, that gives you energy and satisfaction.

user_11;user_1110.jpg;Roasted fresh potatoes 🥔 Stuffed bell pepper 🌶 Balsamico roasted tomatoes and a parsley & garlic sauce 😋 Definitely not eating boring foods just because it's plantbased 😋 - I stuffed the pepper with a mix of wheatberries(cooked), garlic, salt and parsley. But i do recommend filling with a bean or taco mix and some vegan cheese on top! - Coated the potatoes in some oil, salt and pepper. Coated the tomatoes in balsamic vinegar. Placed everything on the same baking tray and baked in the oven for about 25-30 minutes at 200C. *Note the tomatoes are done after about 15 minutes! - - GETTING PROTEIN AS A VEGAN?🌱 - One of the most frequently asked questions. And i do understand it.... many vegan meals are usually higher in carbohydrates. But of course, protein doesn't just come from meat, fish and eggs. - As a vegan you typically get both complex carbs, protein and fiber in the same food - such as beans, lentils, grains🍞 - In general there is a protein hype. You need about 0,8-1,5g protein per kg/body weight. And of course, typically the more foods and variety you eat, the more protein.🌮🥗 - More protein isn't always better. You also need carbs,fat&fibre🥬 - Not every meal had to be super balanced and optimal. But it doesn't hurt to add some more tofu, tempeh, chickpeas, beans, green beans, nuts and seeds into your diet if you want to increase your protein intake. Also oats, bean pasta, chickpea flour, quinoa are some ingredients you can implement more into your diet 😊🙏 - I recently shared a recipe for chickpea tofu if you are allergic to soya... but otherwise soya alternatives are a great source of protein! And don't forget... the majority of foods have some protein 🥪 - Protein supplements are useful for some... especially if you don't eat alot of food or have very little variation in your foods and you are working out alot. Or just an easy/cheap source of protein. But i would recommend actual food first and foremost 🐿🐿🍴 - #nutrition #vegannutrition #healthyfoodshare #wfpb #wfpbrecipes #vegetariskt #vegetables #food #lunch #dinner #mealprep #thefeedfeedvegan #bestofvegan #veganinspiration #buzzfeedfood #veganlife #veganlunch #mindfuleating #health

user_11;user_1112.jpg;Fresh vegetable pasta 🌱 - Who knew it was so easy to get your 5-a-day 😂🤔😅 #joke - This pasta dish is a real HIT... but if I am honest all my meals lately have been pretty amazing. Something about summer, the light and warmth that just makes me feel more inspired. Both with cooking, filming, creating, projects etc . During winter I definitely sort of hibernate and lose creativity and inspiration... but during the summer months it's just about having enough time to do all the things i want and meals to create 😂 - RECIPE. C.A 4 PORTIONS - Pasta, 300-400g 1 zucchini, diced 3-4 garlic cloves, chopped or minced 2 shallot onions, chopped thinly 2 turnips, chopped thinly 2 bell peppers 250g cocktail tomatoes 400ml crushed tomatoes 1-2tbsp tomato paste 1 tbsp vegetable fond 2-3tbsp cooking wine Water Pinch of sugar Salt, pepper, parsley Oil - In a large pot, fry the onion and garlic until brown. In the mean time dice the zucchini, turnip, bell pepper and cocktail tomatoes. All of them can be in bigger slices apart from the turnip which should be cut into small pieces. - Add 2/3 of the chopped vegetables (*adding all the turnips) to the pot along with the crushed tomatoes, vegetable stock, cooking wine and tomatoes paste. Mix. Add a pinch of sugar (to balance out the tomatoes) as well as salt, pepper and parlsey. - In another pot, boil the pasta according to instructions - Allow the vegetable sauce to simmer for 5-10 minutes before adding some water. I didn't measure but start with about 200ml and add more as necessary. Allow to simmer for another 5minutes before adding the rest of the veggies. Keep it on medium/low heat. Taste and season accordingly, such as more salt and parsley. - Once the pasta is done, drain of water and pour into the tomato sauce. Mix. - Serve warm with example some nutritional yeast 😍 - Note, adding beans or using other veggies such as eggplant or mushrooms would also work well! - Don't forget to tag or message me when you try my recipes 😍🌱 - #vegan #eatvegan #vegetables #vegetarian #summerfood #food #instafood #recipes #veganrecipe #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #buzzfeedtasty #tasty #wfpb #wholefoods #wholefoodrecipes #vegetarian

user_11;user_1117.jpg;Sweet potato-white bean patties 🙌🙌😍 - One food which I have always struggled to recreate and actually taste good is veggie/bean burgers. ➡️ Either they turn out too loose, too dry, too gummy or just fall apart. Not to mention i personally don't like veggie burgers that are too mushy, so I usually add rice or quinoa to add some texture. - But mostly I've just settled for fake meat burgers as they have texture, taste and dont fall apart. - However... i have now made a veggie burger that actually tastes good. And it's gluten free! 🌱NOTE. The mixture was rather loose when I formed into patties, but it worked fine when baking 👌 - RECIPE: 2 medium sweet potatoes, boiled and cooled down in the fridge 1 can (240g) white beans *chickpeas works as well 80g rolled oats 200-250ml chickpeaflour (not sure how much this is in grams 😵 I'll update the recipe when I measure) 2-3tbsp corn starch Salt. Pepper. Paprika powder. Chilli powder. **note I think adding some boiled brown rice could work great in this recipe! - In a food processor add the sweet potato, white beans and rolled oats. Mix until combined (doesn't have to be too mushy). Add the seasoning as well as the chickpeaflour and cornstarch. Should turn into a somewhat formable mix, even if still slightly loose. - Form into patties and place on a tray with parchment paper. - Preheat oven to 180C and bake for about 25-30 minutes... or until golden brown on the outside but still soft on the inside. - - NOTES: You can bake the sweet potato instead of boil - it will definitely taste more then. - I can't guarantee the results if you switch to another flour. BUT it should work fine to add a few tbsp flour to keep the mix together. - Adding breadcrumbs TO the mix or to coat the burgers will most likely also work. - Use whatever seasoning you like 🙌😊 - - #vegan #veganinspiration #veganbreakfast #buddhabowls #buzzfeedfood #vegetables #vegetarian #meatfree #mealprep #meatfreemonday #wholefoods #plantbased #plantbasedfood #veganfoodspot #veganfoodshare #veganfoodie #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #veganinspiration #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #wfpbrecipes #vegetariskt #lunch #dinner
user_11;user_1118.jpg;What role does nutrition play in health? - You can't deny that nutrition matters for health.. Proper nutrition can reverse certain illnesses as well as prevent others. It impacts your physical and menfal well being. And adequate proper nutrition is key for a healthier, happier and longer life🍓 - However.... nutrition is not the be all, end all when it comes to health.🌱 - No matter how much broccoli, tofu and water you consume, in an injust society with discrimnation and inequality those will impact a person's health alot more than the food they eat. Example the stress, worry, anxiety that can come from discrimination and inequality can in turn lead to mental and physical unhealth. ➡️ Even if exercise can help with mental illness it can also add to extra stress. - And not to mention if the possibility of healthcare and proper treatment isn't equal then that can impact a persons chance of being healthy and getting treatment for physical or mental illness - Nutrition matters. But other factors also play a huge role in health and wellness. Also a persons relationship with food/body/exercise can sometimes matter more than the actual food the person eats. ➡️ broccoli won't save an unhealthy mindset towards food🥬 - When I do one on one advice/coaching other aspects also play a role.... no point telling someone to buy and eat X and Y or do X or Y workout if lack of sleep because of stress and worry is the main priority. - And of course culture, background and economy matters when it comes to health. - For those of you studying to be dietitians do you learn/talk about these different factors.... as I studied health promotion and the focus is on promoting health in public we did have courses discussing these topics. How inequality and injustice can play a bigger role in a persons (and publics) health than the food they eat. Not to mention the importance of taking into consideration a person's culture when talking about health, nutrition and giving advice. - 📸 amir_menahem - #health #healthy #healthandwellness #nutrition #kostvetare #kostrådgivare #vegannutrition #food #foodfreedom #healthpromotion #veganfood #nutritionadvice #wholefoods #user_11 #summer
user_11;user_1119.jpg;Avocado hummus 🙏🙏🌱 - Next level hummus by adding avocados and green peas. Basically a complete (nutritious) meal in one dip 😉😉 - I based it off my typical hummus recipe which is chickpeas, garlic, salt, lemon juice, tahini, oil and some cold water. Added 2 avocados and some green peas for extra colour. And added more liquid until I got the desired consistency!🥑🥑 - This is one of the best hummus/dips I've eaten in a long time 😍 And if you haven't made it already.... do it. In fact it's so delicious that you may just want to eat it as it is with a spoon... that's what I did anyway! - Or combine with some potatoes, as a dip for veggies, add to nachos or tacos or it could even work as a sauce for pasta or combined with some tofu and rice 🌱 - #vegan #veganinspiration #veganrecipe #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #wholefoods #bestofvegan #plantbasedfood #letscookvegan #vegetarian #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #buzzfeedfood #veganfoodspot #veganfoodshare #lunch #dinner #mealprep #veganmealprep #dip #wfpb
user_11;user_1120.jpg;Back to normal..... well not really. - I don't think normal is what anyone should be aiming for right now. Instead CHANGE. Reflecting on history... reflecting on what's already been done and the consequences of that. Instead now focusing on the future and how we all can impact the future generations..... and not to belittle any problem. Instead simultaneously working on all problems in society. Let's learn from past mistakes. Let's teach future generations to act differently.... take care of one another. Including animals. Take care of the planet. Learn kindness from an early age and of course hoping that those in power begin to try to make changes as well... - So.... while you are doing this self reflecting on how we move forward and make active changes in our own personal lives (while still keeping ourselves mentally and physically healthy) and in society..... why not make some toast with hummus, balsamic roasted tomatoes, avocados, parlsey and balsamico on top 🌱🌱 - If there is ONNNEEE meal of mine you want to recreate at home, it is this one. I promise you it was the best meal I ate all week. And if it wasn't due to fullness I would have easily eaten the whole loaf of bread with this combo 😍😍😍 - Make it... tag me... and also comment below... - - - #vegan #veganfood #plantbasedfood #plantbased #food #foodfreedom #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #healthy #healthyfood #vegetables #vegetarian #meatfree #goodmorning #instafood #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #wfpbrecipes #wholefoods #dinner #veganinspiration #veganfoodspot

user_11;user_1124.jpg;Turning to food for comfort in times of stress or anxiety... (or maybe you are the opposite and completly lose your appetite in response to stress and emotions. But that is for another post) - Right now it is not strange if you are turning to food for comfort. It is somerhjng that provides joy, energy and can give a dopamine kick to feel better. It can make your feelings and emotions go away... even if just for a little while. - If you are turning to food for comfort.. or to deal with emotions, don't shame yourself. You are human. - Allow yourself to eat. However also try to address your actual feelings, emotions and triggers. - Ask yourself is food really the thing you need right now.... maybe it is... but maybe it isn't. Try to figure out what you actually need at the moment that you turn to food to help suppress your feelings and emotions. - What is really going on in your head. Can you deal with your emotions in other ways which aren't related to eating? Writing. Reading. Talking to someone. Going for a walk. Meditating. Doing a hobby. - When you learn your triggers. Figure out your actual feelings, accept them and find a more sustainable way of coping with them it can give more enjoyment to food again. As well as a sense of understanding and acceptance of yourself and how you feel. - Don't shame youreelf for eating and don't restrict the following day if you have eaten more food than usual in response to emotions. Instead accept it and move on. - Sometimes the best and most useful thing is to eat that food that gives you comfort and makes you feel better. But don't make food your only coping strategy for emotions - And remember, conscious or unconscious restricting will make you more likely to turn to food to cope with emotions. So nourish your body and mind everyday and tackle the *real* problems to make food just food again. - If you find social media is triggering you or impacting you negatively... log off. Take some time off social media. Focus on your mental wellbeing 💕 Limit your triggers and what could be causing strong emotions! - - - #vegan #health #nutrition #healthandwellness #vegannutrition #healthyfood #foodfreedom #realrecovery

user_11;user_1126.jpg;blacklivesmatter #blackouttuesday @blklivesmatter - - - Awareness, listening and learning are all important... but most important is action and change. Right now is not my time to speak... instead to give space to the BIPOC creators and individuals who can both help us understand the impact of racism and social injustice, but also how and what (we) white people can do to help. - I talk about mental health, overall health and happiness and that is of course all inclusive. But I can't possibly imagine the negative impact on mental health that a person can have just based on the colour of their skin. There are WOC who talk about mental health, nutrition and create amazing recipes and this week (and always) spotlight should be on them. - If you don't know what to say. LISTEN. If you don't know what to do EDUCATE YOURSELF. If you don't know how to help, DONATE. - I will continue sharing resources and posts in my stories on what we can all do NOW and in the future to help and actually make a change. - Yes I am a food account and people don't want me to get political. But continuing on like usual and not actively trying to help is not ok with me. - Health is all inclusive. And for their to be equality with all human rights including access to the right health care and food, it means making changes individually and within society and politics. - Enough is enough. And if you are tired of all these posts... well then you are very privileged because black people are tired of being killed just for the colour of their skin. Log off of soxial media and do some reflecting.. maybe read a book about racism and black history and GET ANGRY at the injustice that is happening everyday.
user_11;user_1127.jpg;"Summer inspired meal: vegan burgers with tzatziki, garlic and thyme roasted potatoes and salad! - ""What is ok to post right now?""... i don't know. Just posting food and recipes can feel so *ignorant* and unimportant right now. But at the same time food can bring people together, food is something social and many use instagram for inspiration. - I have seen that some will take a break from posting this week... and i don't know what is best? Right now it's about listening and learning... I am not ignoring what is happening, I will continue to share in my stories. - Backing away from things that are tough isn't always a good idea. And social media is tricky.... it's not always easy to know what to post or what to say and in all honesty it has nothing to do with me anyway. White privileged people already take up the majority of space and time on social media - I guess I'll see what feels right.... and I would love to know your feedback as well! ➡️ Being willing to listen, learn and educate yourself is what we all need to do right now. - There is alot of information on how we can act both online and IN REAL LIFE to help with the social injustice and to actually make a CHANGE. Not just words.. but ACTION. 🚩 - Recipe for the tzatziki: 1️⃣Grate the 2/3 cucumber - place on a plate and pour some salt over. Set aside for 20 minutes. - 2️⃣Mix together 200-300ml of thick vegan yoghurt/fraiche. Mix in 2 tbsp olive oil. 2 cloves garlic, minced. 1-2 tbsp lemon juice. 1 tsp apple cider vinegar. 1 teaspoon dried dill. Salt and lots of pepper. - 3️⃣Press the cucumber of water. Add to the other ingredients. Mix and place in the fridge for a few hours before serving. - For the potatoes I washed. Peeled. Drizzled with oil, salt, pepper, crushed garlic and thyme before roasting in the oven at 220C for about 25 minutes. - - #vegan #veganfood #thefeedfeed #bestofvegan #wholefoods #plantbased #plantbasedfood #veganfoodshare #veganinspiration #veganfoodspot #buzzfeedfood #buzzfeedvegetarian #vegetarian #eatvegan #meatfree #mealprep #summer #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #buzzfeedfood #wfpb #buddhabowls #lunch #dinner"
user_11;user_1128.jpg;"What is a ""normal body""....? So I recently wrote my thoughts about ""normal eating"" and I also wanted to adress the idea of a normal body. What even is that? - All bodies look different. We are shaped differently. We have different genetics and DNA. Some have blue eyes, some have green eyes and some have one green eye and one blue eye. Some have black hair, others have blond hair and others somewhere in between. - This weekend when I was working on a project I was going to write the sentence ""look at normal bodies"" and it got me thinking.... how do you even define a normal body. Well, to start off with... one that isn't photoshopped or edited. - But you know what.... even if someone poses with the right angles and lighting it is still their body and normal body. Just captured in a certain light and angle. - Also we often refer to normal bodies as a certain weight range/body size... but you know what... all shapes and sizes are normal. Of course extreme measures and methods to reach a certain size may not be deemed as healthy but should it be called abnormal? - Yes- Normal bodies CAN have cellulite, acne, scars, stomach rolls, stretch marks, birthmarks and all other scars and marks that come from being human and alive. But a normal body may also not have any of those and it is still normal. - Normalising body shapes and sizes includes all body shapes and sizes and shouldn't just be about ""a little above average"" body size (I.e the plus size models). But accepting all bodies for how they are... naturally. And I'm not going to get into body modifications and operations that is a person's own choice and whether it is nlrmal or not is not my place to comment or judge. - But all bodies - which aren't edited and photoshopped are normal and that includes all skin colours and types. And all types of disabilities. - Let's start with self love and self acceptance as we also begin to accept all body shapes and sizes and most of all NO JUDGEMENT or DISCRIMINATION based on somebodies body or physical appearance. We're all different and unique. That's human. - Instead of normal bodies... NORMALIZE all bodies. -"
user_11;user_1129.jpg;Chocolate orange oatmeal to start the day! - To make the oatmeal i just made regular oats and added juice and zest from one orange as well as cacao powder, vanilla, stevia and a pinch of salt! DELICIOUS 😍😍 - I am sure nobody has missed the news about George Floyd... and if you haven't, Google it. It makes me sad that it had to take this for so many.. myself included to speak up about racism and social injustices on our platforms. Granted we all have our niches, want to stay out if conflict and avoid controversies.. as well as many use instagram to maybe avoid reality and all the sh*t that happens in real life. But times like this.... staying silent to stay neutral is choosing the side of the oppressors. - And you know what.. it's not enough to just NOT be racist... but to be ANTI racist. This means having the tough conversations with friends, family or acquaintances who think it's OK to make racist comments or jokes. Just like when it comes to other social injustices or discrimination... don't partake in the discrimination and call it out when you can. - And if anyone unfollows me for posting this... then bye and educate yourself. - As a white privileged girl I also need to educate myself. I know about the discrimination and social injustices but will never know first hand what it's like to experience it... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. For change to happen within society there needs to be individual changes as well ... and that starts with knowledge and education. - - - #blacklivesmatter #vegan #veganfood #breakfast #wholefoods #plantbased #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #healthy #healthyfood #buzzfeedfood #oatmeal #user_11 #breakfast #veganinspiration #veganrecipe #veganmealprep #recipes #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #veganinspiration #meatfree #plantbasedfood
user_11;user_1130.jpg;The only way to really differentiate the weekdays from the weekend right now is to make extra fancy breakfasts on Saturday and Sunday 😋😋😉😉 GIIRRRRLLL (and guys) you make those pancakes, waffles and avocado toast🙌🙌 - Today's breakfast was..... FRENCH TOAST 🧇 - Very easy to make. The best is to use a sturdier type of bread which you have left out to dry overnight. But if you just have regular bread then either roast on low heat so it dried out or leave overnight in the open so it goes stale. - For the liquid mix: 240ml plantbased mylk 1-2 tbsp flour 1 tbsp chia seeds 1-3tbsp sugar or stevia (depending on how sweet you want it and whether the plantbased mylk is sweetened or not) Cinnamon, vanilla and a pinch of salt. - 1️⃣Mix together and let sit for 5 minutes. 2️⃣Then dip the bread (slices) into the mix, coating completely but shaking off the excess coating. 3️⃣ Fry on medium heat until golden brown on both sides! 4️⃣ Either roll in a mix of cinnamon and stevia or just drizzle over some emlted chocolate or eat with some vanilla soya yoghurt!! - With my account my goal is to show how you can eat so many different plantbased meals. I want to inspire you to eat more plantbased and get creative. - But also to show that all foods fit into a healthy lifestyle. Sure wholegrain bread is typically recommended as it is richer in fiber... but eating some regular white bread won't harm you or make you unhealthy. Just like using some sugar in recipes isn't a big deal. It's all about an overall balance and that is what I want to promote 🙌🙌 No need to cut out foods you enjoy to be healthy... infact healthy isn't about restriction at all. Look at the bigger picture and enjoy all foods!! 🍓🙌🧇🍑 - - - #vegan #veganfood #breakfast #veganbreakfast #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan #eatsbyizzy #foodfreedom #intuitiveeating #hralth #healthy #snack #snaxks #vegetarian #veganrecipe #veganinspiration #veganfoodshare #wholefoods #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #buzzfeedfood #buzzfeedvegetarian

user_11;user_1133.jpg;"What is normal eating....? - If I'm honest I don't believe there is such a thing as normal eating. What is normal for you could be completely different for someone else. Your view on food and what you consider as normal is based on your environment, those closest to you, the culture you grew up in..... if you grew up in a household with a focus on dieting, then yo-yo diets will be normal for you. If you grew up in a household where your parents always cooked from scratch or ate vegetarian/vegan... that will be normal for you... just like if you grew up in a household where fastfood made up the majority of your meals, that may be what you consider normal eating. - Also dieting, restricting and feeling anxious or guilty about eating is so normalized that many don't think twice about it..... and that really shouldn't be something that is ""normal"" - So the goal is not necessarily to eat normal.... the goal is to find your own personal balance with food. And just like ""normal eating"", balance is different for everyone. - Making peace with food and being able to enjoy all types of food without any guilt or anxiety involved. Not having food take up the majority of your time and thoughts each day (*unless it is what you work with obv.). Eating food you enjoy, eating food that makes you feel good, eating a varied diet. - When I give advice to individuals about nutrition I never typically say ""eat like this"".... why? Because what foods the person wants to eat and enjoys eating is based on culture, preference, availability, allergies/illnesses..... there are of course nutrition recommendations. But NO SPECIFIC way you need to eat to be healthy. - Instead of focusing on ""normal"" more focus on a balanced intake, eating food you enjoy, not putting moral value in the food you eat and not letting fear or guilt impact your food choices. Nourishing your body and mind and eating what you need/enjoy to be healthy regardless of how or what others choose to eat. - - #health #healthy #healthyfood #healthandwellness #healthpromotion #wholefoodsplantbased #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #nutritionadvice #vegannutrition #kostrådgivare #kostvetare #vegannutrition #vegan #food"

Not to mention you can use the veggies you have at home.... making it a perfect way to use up what you have in your fridge or pantry. While still making a delicious and nutritious meal.

Garlic and thyme potato wedges, BBQ tofu, avocado and lots of veggies. - Getting several of my 5 a day in one meal! And also... to make crispy tofu my tip is to 1. Press of water, 2. Coat in cornstarch, seasoning, salt and some oil before frying or baking! (Or in your airfryer!). It will turn out so much crisper then 😍😍🙌 - And a reminder I want to leave you with today.... many exercise so they can eat. See exercise only as a way to burn calories.... but you should EAT and nourish yourself so you have energy to live life and have energy to workout. When you fuel your body and mind you will feel so much better and your workouts will both be more beneficial and fun when you are properly nourished. - Don't be scared to eat. Your body needs energy and nutrients..... take it from someone who used to do double workouts, scared to eat carbs, mostly ate protein and used to call a 10km walk a rest day 🙃... i can say that my ENJOYMENT for working out is so much higher now. Not to mention progress and of course... I am not DRAINED and out for the day after working out. Instead it gives me energy, endorphins and strength... not something that completely tires me and exercise is done out of guilt, fear of weight gain and shaping my body. - Eat. Nourish your body and mind.

Mix until smooth (*but not hummus smooth!) 2)Add the rest of the ingredients.. adding flour until you have a dough texture (not too loose and not too dry). Add the chopped chocolate. 3) Roll into small balls/cookies. Place on 1-2 baking trays.  4) preheat oven to 200C and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown on the outside. If yiu want them crispy bake longer.  5) take out of the oven and allow to cool completely before eating as it is or with plantbased milk. - - #foodtrend #foodfreedom #vegan #veganfood #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedvegan @thefeedfeed.vegan #wholefoods #plantbased #breakfast #veganskt #snacks #healthyfood #buzzfeedfood #vegetarian #plantbasedfood #veganfoodshare #cookies #dessert #tiktok #wholefoods #f52grams #health #healthybreakfast #user_11

user_11;user_1140.jpg;Tacos/nachos is a meal i never tire of! Not only can you vary the toppings (lots of different veggies, whether you use beans/lentils or soy mince, different sauces!) But also you can use nachos, homemade nachos, potatoes (*as nachos) or different types of bread 🥙🥙🌮 - What's not to love 🥰 Not to mention usually works for vegans, omnivores and those with celiac disease and need to avoid gluten! - I made this nacho plate using (very) stale nachos. Taco fried soymince and chickpeas. And some grated vegan cheese which i placed in the oven for 5-6 minutes. Then topped with the veggies i had at home and it resulted in this delicious plate of food!!! - You can of course make your own using potatoes or homemade nacho crisps if you prefer 👌👌 - Do you like tacos? 🌮🌮 Also what's your preferred way to eat them..... with tortilla bread? Corn taco shells? Nacho chips? Or just as a taco salad with nachos on the side? 🥬🥬 - I hope you all have a lovely Friday and weekend! - - #dinner #taco #tacofredag #tacos #veganlunch #veganfood #vegandinner #onepanmeal #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #cheapfood #whatveganseat #plantpowered #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vegansnackshare #dinnerfood #lunch #friday #veganfoodshares #healthyfood #tastyfood #foodblogger #f52grams #forksoverknives #buzzfeedtasty #buzzfeedvegan #vegetarianrecipes
user_11;user_1141.jpg;Instead of hyperfocusing on small details such as X gram or Y gram. % carbs, fat, protein. Or how many kcal in X or Y..... look at the bigger picture. - The small details of grams, specific kcal amount or percentage of macronutrients has little importance compared to your overall intake. - Focus on healthy habits.... trying to eat some fruit and vegetables daily. Drinking a few glasses of water each day. Not overusing salt (but you don't need to cut it out completely). Not eating overly sugared foods daily. Eating some fibrerich foods daily. Trying to eat varied throughout the week. Eating food until you are satisfied. Getting enough sleep. Doing an exercise form you enjoy on a regular basis. - All of those habits have more importance for your health than micromanaging food. But many are quick to focus on the small details such as does apple or banana have more calories or should you exercise before or after breakfast. Those are quite irrelevant for overall health. - Look at the bigger picture and overall healthy habits. Leave the minor details to those who work with nutrition and healthy who can help you with those if you need it (i.e if you need help getting enough of certain vitamins/minerals. Or eat the energy amount you require). - Food shouldn't be seen as numbers and health is not a mathsgame with focus on numbers.... Food and eating is not equivalent to X amount of hours spent exercising. And it shouldn't be a game of plus, minus, zero each time you eat. - This summer enjoy ice cream... you don't need to choose the one with least calories. 1 ice cream (or a few ice cream) never made anyone unhealthy. Look at the overall picture... if all you're eating is ice cream that's not the best. But if you enjoy an ice cream once or a few times a week.... enjoy it. It's no big deal 👌👌 - - #vegan #health #healthy #nutrition #nutritionpost #healthyfood #icecream #balance #foodfreedom #intuitiveeating #mindfuleating #eatsbyizzy #user_11 #veganfood #summer #food #plantbased #bestofvegan #realrecovery #f52grams #3vanner #wholefoods #foodbalance
user_11;user_1142.jpg;"Vegan savoury crepes with asparagus, tempeh, creme fraiche and sun dried tomatoes. - Typically I'm not so hungry in the mornings and instead prefer a later breakfast/brunch... and this was what i was craving today! - Breakfast has many benefits and is recommended to eat as 1. It gives you energy when you most need it. 2. Can help with concentration and focus. 3. Can help limit snacking the whole day or overeating in the evenings - However if you just aren't hungry in the mornings.. eat later when you are hungry. Or eat something small to give you energy and eat a bigger brunch/lunch 🙏🙏 - Some people don't function without breakfast while others prefer a later breakfast... both are ok. ➡️ Do what works best for you. And also a food routine can be beneficial, especially now in quarantine! - You don't need to skip breakfast just because you ate alot the previous day or evening. You don't need to skip breakfast to save calories. You don't need to skip breakfast as a way to lose weight. And you don't need to skip breakfast until you have ""earned it"". If you're hungry in the mornings.... eat your breakfast. If you're not hungry, wait until you are. ➡️ and if you're not hungry but know you need to eat your breakfast regardless... eat breakfast 🙏🌱 - - #brunch #breakfast #veganbreakfast #plantpowered #plantbasedfood #vegetarian #wholefoods #simplevegan #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #healthyfood #tastyfood #foodblogger #vegetarianfood #vegetarianrecipes #snack #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #meatfree #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tasty #nutritionadvice #healthcoach #veganerisverige"

It's crazy that we're half way through May... i barely know where this month has gone. And only 2 more weeks of school work left.... 🙏 I always say it, but WOW this term has been alot of work and despite being ok at studying at home... the motivation just hasn't always been there 😔 I am sure others feel the same way? - But how trying to plan for the summer instead... whatever this summer entails 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ - But one thing is for sure, I am going to try be outside as much as I can! I'll still be mealprepping and hopefully get back into YouTube and other projects that have been put on hold! - If there is anything you want to see from me on here or my other social media platforms.

user_11;user_1144.jpg;"""The best granola I've ever eaten"" is the review/response i got from this granola..... so I mean... if you haven't tried this granola yet it's time you do!!! - Peanut butter banana bread granola 🤩 The huge clusters in this granola make it even better. To get the clusters, don't overmix the granola and let the cluters build them selves when you pour the mix onto the baking tray! - Making this sugar free and lower fat? Well... my best advice is to look for another recipe then. Because i can't guarantee the results if you do too much swapping of ingredients. You could try with another syrup form and using oil instead of margarine... but completely omitting sugar and fat won't make this granola the same... just FYI. - RECIPE: https://user_11.org/2019/10/26/banana-bread-granola/ - RECIPE:  Prep: 10 minutes, cook time: 35 minutes, cooling time: 2-3 hours 250g oats 100ml syrup 200ml melted vegan margarine 2 bananas, mashed 2-4tbsp peanut butter *can be omitted 2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp cardamom Pinch of salt 2 tbsp chia seeds Options: banana chips, coconut shreds, pumpkin seeds  HOW TO:  Preheat the oven to 180C. Begin by adding the dry ingredients in a bowl – oats, seasoning, chia seeds and also if you want some walnuts, coconut pieces or other extras. - Melt the margarine in a pot, add the syrup once melted. - Mash the bananas and add to the margarine mix along with the peanut butter. Mix until combined. - Pour the liquid over the oats and mix so that all the oats are covered. - Pour the granola onto 1-2 baking oans with parchment paper, spread the granola out. However it is ok to leave some clusters, as that is what makes the granola crunchy! - Bake in the oven for around 35-40 minutes. Check on the granola after 20 minutes and stir the granola a little so it bakes evenly. - After c.a 35 minutes, turn the oven off and you can let the granola sit in the oven for 30-60 minutes to cool (leave the oven open a little) before placing in the open to cool for another 2-3 hours. Or you can take the granola out and allow to FULLY cool for 2-3 hours before placing in airtight jars. - - #breakfastfood #veganbreakfast #snack #snacks #vegansnackshare #breakfasttips"
user_11;user_1145.jpg;"When i say i like salad.... this is what i mean 😅😅🌱😋 - In this warm salad i used green leaves, tomatoes, roasted garlic and thyme potatoes, avocado, radish, greek cheese* and beluga lentils 🤩 - Beluga lentils are my new favourite. I love that they hold their structure even when cooked so they don't become mushy when cooked like red lentils do. - Also 1 serving of beluga lentils provides between 15-18g protein 🤩 As well as iron, fiber, b vitamins and a source of complex carbs. - Granted... you shouldn't just see food as macros or micros, that just turns food into nutrients instead of seeing food as a ""whole"" not just numbers/nutrients. ➡️ It can easily become disordered if you only want to eat foods you deem as most nutritious and can never eat anything that isn't super nutritious..... health includes all types of foods. Just in different quantities! - BUTTT.... it doesn't hurt to know that the food you eat is also nutritious. Even if overall health is about habits and overall choices, not specific numbers 🌱🙏 - If you are in need of some summer dishes then filling salads like this are wonderful. And adding lentils such as beluga lentils or green lentils adds nutrients as well as helps make salads more filling and satiating compared to if it's just veggies and leaves. - - - #vegan #salad #summer #summerfood #food52 #veganfood #whatveganseat #plantpowered #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #forksoverknives #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tasty #tastyfood #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #plantpowered #user_11"
user_11;user_1146.jpg;In my stories today i talked about how to eat cheap and nutritious.... and one way to eat cheap is to minimize food waste. To get creative and use what you have at home.... and that is exactly what i did here! - Instead of using breadcrumbs to coat the tofu, i used tacoshells which i had leftover from Friday. In my stories you can see when i made these... as well as tips to eat cheap and nutritious! - Now with Covid-19 it has impacted millions of people economically.... not being able to work, or being fired or for some people, expecting to work but no longer having that opportunity. - So saving money by eating cheap is what many people may need to do. And even if you don't need to budget your food purchases, it can still be a good idea to save money on food where possible 🙏 - And as well as know.... a healthy balanced diet is important for overall health. But you don't need to eat expensive to eat healthy.... but of course the more money you can spend on food, the more variety and spontaneity you can have with your food choices. But many unprocessed foods, which already are vegan, are both cheap and nutritious 🌱🌱🌱 Check out my stories to read more! - - Baked these in the oven at 200C for c.a 20-25minutes. And recipe for the potatoes is in another post on my feed. - #vegan #veganlunch #letscookvegan #icabuffet #plantbasedfood #plantpowered #buzzfeedtasty #food52 #forksoverknives #worldwidevegan #f52grams #buzzfeedhealth #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #vegetarianrecipes #veganrecipes #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #cheapfood #studenteats #wholefoodsplantbased #limitfoodwaste

user_11;user_1148.jpg;"""Why do all social events/gatherings/meet ups always have to be food focused?"" ➡️ Have you ever had that thought before... i sure did in the past.🥺 - I feared Christmas, easter and new years because of all the food that would be involved.🚫 - I got angry when someone suggest we meet over lunch or get a ""fika"" and catch up. I got irritated when family get togethers would be done over dinner parties. 🥂 - That irritation and anger was due to fear.... due to my anxiety around food. Being put in social situations where i was ""expected"" to eat was too much for me.... and i wouldn't have an excuse or reason to not eat. - Now a days i love meeting up with people/friends and getting lunch. I love cooking, baking and eating when it comes to hightimes and family get togethers. 🥗🥙 - People bond and connect over food. It's been that way for years and is even more predominent in certain cultures. Food is an enjoyment. Social gatherings and connecting with others can be an enjoyment and part of life. Food can help people bond and connect as it's one thing people have in common.🍜 - However when you have an eating disorder or if you are on a diet then the anger and irritation over food being the main focus in so many situations is often driven by fear. And it can be good to address that fear... challenge those thoughts. - Of course you can and should meet others and not always have it involve food. And with hightimes it doesn't have to ONLY be about the food, but spending time with people. 🤼‍♀️ - And of course as a vegan it can be frustrating that hightimes revolve around eating alot of animal products... and even more frustrating if friends/family don't accept you being vegan.🌱 - But your fear of food and eating with others can make events that include food - alot more food focused than they actually are. When your focus or fear is on food it can feel like everything revolves around food.. when in reality food is just a *part* of meeting up/socializing, not the whole part. - Challenging your fears... understanding why they are fears or what the fear is actually based on, can help you overcome them.🙏 - - #health #healthy #nutritionadvice #nutrition #realrecovery"
user_11;user_1149.jpg;Hummus pasta 🙏 Have you tried it before or are you willing to try it? 😍 don't knock it till you try it! - It's a good way to get all the nutrition benefits of chickpeas without eating the round chickpeas! It makes for a great creamy sauce and of course lot's of garlic! You can use different types of hummus such as sundried tomato hummus, roasted bell pepper hummus or sweet potato hummus for different tastes. - Storebought hummus is never as good as homemade... and homemade is never as good as the actual hummus you can get in the Middle East 😍 It was hummus heaven there 🙏 - When i make my hummus i like to use ALOT of garlic. Lemon juice. Runny tahini. Oil and some cold water. And when i have the patience, get rid of the chickpea shell for super smooth hummus 🤩 - - - #vegan #veganfood #pasta #pastasalad #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #healthyfood #tastyfood #plantbasedfood #plantbaseddinner #plantbasedlunch #plantbased #buzzfeedtasty #vegetarianrecipes #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #veganfoodvideo #veganfoodrecipe
user_11;user_1150.jpg;Sweet potato pie!! - So these bars/pie was just a random idea i got when i made the sweet potato dip (in my previous post). There are no *exact* measurements as i just mixed it together. But as so many requested i post the recipe, here it is 🙏🍠🍠 - For the filling: 2-3 medium-large sweet potato 1-2 tsp cinnamon 1tsp ginger 3-4 tbsp stevia (add more according to preference) 1/2 tsp nutmeg Pinch of salt 2tbsp cornstarch 2-3 tbsp flour (If necessary, some coconut milk or oatmilk) - Peel, dice and boil the sweet potato until soft. Once boiled, pour away the water and allow to cool. Once cooled, add to a mixer and puree, adding the spices. Once pureed, mix in the cornstarch and flour. Optional, add in 1-2tbsp almond butter. - While the sweet potatoes are cooking, make the pie base: - In a bowl mix together: 188g flour, pinch of salt, 2 tbsp stevia. Mix together. Add 113g vegan margarine (cut into cubes) and with your hands press into the flour mix so it begins to crumble. Then add 60-70ml oatmilk until it turns into a dough ball. ➡️ Place in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. - Heat the oven to 200C. Grease a baking form, press the dough into the form to make the crust. Poke holes in the crust with a fork. Bake in the oven around 15-18 minutes. - Then take out of the oven. Add the sweet potato filling and bake in the oven around 25-30 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to sit in the oven for 15 minutes before taking out and allowing to cool completely. - Note the pie crust turns out rather crunchy - not flaky. So you can use another crust if you want a short bread base or make even use nuts/seeds as the base. - Similar to pumpkin pie cake🍠🍠 - - #vegan #veganism #snack #food #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #goodoldvegan #foodblogger #food #snacks #f52grams #studenteats #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #bestofvegan #vegetarianrecipes #potato #potatoes
user_11;user_1151.jpg;My diet doesn't just consist of pancakes, fries and pasta... It also consists of a whole bunch of veggies. Including this eggplant, bean and lentil lasagne. - Delicious to make a big batch or make smaller portions directly in glass jars. - The key with the eggplant is to 1. Thin slice, 2. Salt the eggplant slices to draw out some moisture and 3. Fry in some oil, garlic and black pepper before using instead of lasagne plates. - HOW to make these: RECIPE: 4 portions/1 large form  Ingredients: 3-4 carrots 1/2-1 zucchini 2 small onions 2 gloves garlic 300-400g red lentils 400-600ml crushed tomatoes 1tsp liquid smoke 1/2 package black beans Optional: vegan soy mince, sweet corn (i used vegan meat balls which i chopped into small pieces – this was for extra texture and taste. But is not necessary) 2 eeggplants, sliced thinly Oil, salt, black pepper 300g vegan cheese, grated 100-200ml vegan creme fraiche 2-3 tomatoes How to: Slice eggplant thinly. Place on a plate and pour over some salt. Allow to sit for 30-60 minutes. - In the mean time: Chop veggies (carrots, zucchini, onion) into small cubes. Fry in some oil and salt. – Add about 300-400g red lentils along with 400-600ml crushed tomatoes. Add some garlic, salt and pepper. Mix and allow to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add some liquid smoke. – Add in black beans. Optional, vegan mince or sweet corn. – Make the cheese sauce (or bechemel sauce). Mix grated vegan cheese with vegan creme fraiche. – Fry the eggplant slices in some oil and garlic. - Then layer the lasagne. First a little tomato sauce on the bottom to stop the lasagne plate from burning to the form. Then start off with eggplant, red lentil mix, “cheese” mix, repeat and finish with a layer of cheese mix and some tomatoes. – Bake in the oven at 225C for 25-30 minutes . Top with some tomatoes, black pepper and parsley. - - #mealprep #vegan #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #healthyfood #tastyfood #foodblogger #foodfredom #edrecovery #edsoldier #recoverywarriors #food #lunch #simplecooking #easyveganfood #veganskmat #veganrecipe #recipes #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #dinner #vegetarianrecipes

user_11;user_1154.jpg;This is not just any pasta bolognese... this is FANCY pasta bolognese(i.e pasta ragu) with cooking wine and all.... #thisiswhatquarantinehasdonetome - Ingredients: Vegan soy mince (i used formbar färs) i used around 300-400g 2 grated carrots 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 red onion - diced 1 small jar of sundried tomatoes 400ml crushed tomatoes 2tbsp tomatopaste 2tbsp vegetable fond 2tbsp soya sauce (dark) 100ml cooking wine (red) Parlsey Water (around 250-300ml) Around 50-100ml oat cookingcream Cocktail tomatoes Salt & pepper Oil Vegan cheese (mozzarella flavour) Pasta of choice - choose a larger style pasta that absorbs the sauce - How to: In a large frying pan or pot fry a GENEROUS (yes- more than you think) amount of oil along with the vegan mince. Fry for 6-7 minutes on medium heat. - In the meantime. Grate the carrots. Dice the onion. Mince the garlic. - Then add those to the frying pan and allow the onion to get some colour. Around 3-4 minutes of frying. - Then add the tomato paste, vegetable fond, soya sauce, diced sundried tomatoes and cooking wine. If necessary add a little water. Allow to simmer for a few minutes to let the wine cook a little. - Then add the jar of crushed tomatoes, water, oatcream, parsley, salt and pepper. Allow to simmer on medium heat for 30-40 minutes. Stirring from time to time. The liquid should reduce so you have a thicker mince sauce - but if it gets too dry, add a little more water. Or oat cream. - During the last 10 minutes (note... the sauce can cook longer and more flavours will be drawn out then) - begin to cook the pasta. - Once the pasta is done, drain the water. Add the pasta to the sauce. Mix. Add cocktail tomatoes.

Dessert for breakfast but it's *almost* sugarfree. - To make the SP puree 🍠 - Peel and dice 1-2 sweet potatoes. Boil until soft and then let cool completely. - Once cooled, add to a food processor. Add 2-3 heaped tbsp whipped soya cream (or use some type of plantbased mylk for lowerfat/sugarfree). 1tsp ginger. 1tsp cinnamon. 1/4tsp nutmeg. 1tsp vanilla powder. 2-3tbsp stevia. 1tbsp peanut butter (or other nut butter). - Mix until a puree! Taste and add more seasoning according to preference 🙂 - Make the cinnamon chips - or, use whatever bread you have at home. - Preheat oven to 200C. Chop the bread into slices. Pour some cinnamon, vanilla and stevia ontop of the chips. Drizzle over some oil or melted margarine. Bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes until crispy (this could vary depending what bread you use.) - Then.... eat, enjoy and thank me later 😉😉😉🙏🍠 - - If only you could smell how amazing my apartment smells right now with the cinnamon and ginger 🤩 - #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tasty #food #snackbowl #snack #snacks #vegansnack #letscookvegan #health #healthy #user_11 #lifestyle #food #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #vegetarianrecipe #meatfreemeals #breakfastlover #breakfast #potato #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday
user_11;user_1156.jpg;"The problems of complimenting someones weightloss. - In today's society.... weightloss is complimented. It is applauded for. But when you compliment someone for their weightloss.... you don't know what you are actually complimenting them for..🤷‍♀️ - For restricting? For tiredness and lack of energy? For punishing their body for 2 months?.... maybe you are complimenting an illness, physical or mental that has caused them to lose weight? Maybe you are complimenting depression, anxiety or an eating disorder?🙏 - From personal experience, in the past when people said ""body goals"" or ""i want to look like you""... they were enforcing my eating disorder and body focus. They were complimenting and applauding my eating disorder, depression and anxiety.... and of course it fuelled my obsession with wanting to look a certain and control my body. Because that was what i was.... I was my body and to be loved and accepted i had to look a certain way. - Telling someone who loses weight, ""wow you look so good now"" basically implies - you didn't look good before.🤦 - the focus is on their body.... just on appearance. Forgetting all the other aspects of healthy. A person can lose weight and reach a healthy weight/socially accepted body but be incredibly unhealthy mentally and/or physically. - Weightloss doesn't have to be a bad thing. HOWEVER skip the body comments, for everyone. Instead give compliments about other things - You look stronger. You look happier. Do you feel healthier? You are glowing? Seems like you have more confidence? - Or.... just compliment them as a person. That they are kind, caring, smart, compassionate, a good listener. - Focus doesn't have to be on a persons body or appearance. It is so imprinted in us that we have to look a certain way and to only compliment a persons body.. but it can do more harm than good. - Also don't comment on peoples weight gain... the person is most likely already aware. And weight gain doesn't have to be bad.. it can mean regaining life🙌 - Stop with the body goals comments. Stop applauding weightloss. Instead inner happiness and health.

The recipe is from @veganricha so i take no credit for the recipe and you can find it on her blog 🙌 The only thing i did different was to add some parsley and garlic to the mix as well as on top for extra flavour! - I combined these with a bbq sauce. - After trying these I'm thinking i want to give homemade bagels and churros ago 🙌 I mean what else is there to do other than a bunch of cooking and baking (well aside from studying and working 😂). - Do you have any recipe ideas YOU want to try making soon... or maybe recipes you want me to test and maybe film for YT? 🥨🥨🧇🥖🥐 - - - #vegan #snack #snacks #vegansnack #letscookvegan #healthycooking #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthy #veganstudent #veganuary #letscookvegan #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #lunch #dinner #vegandinner #thefeedfeed #goodoldvegan #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #forksoverknives #buddhabowl #bestofvegan #tasty #food
user_11;user_1158.jpg;Anyone completely losing track of the days at the moment....? Could be Monday, could be Thursday, could be Sunday. All the days definitely blend into one.... - But one way of keeping track of the days? Make fries on Fryday 😉😉 And tacos on Tuesday 😂 Oh and don't forget the Sunday brunch! - In my stories i shared my best tip with making sweet potato fries, and that is to 1. Chop into thin fries and place in cold water for 30-60 minutes. Then pat dry, add to a bowl and pour over chilli, garlic powder, salt and pepper as well as some cornstarch and oil. Mix and then bake in the oven at c.a 200C for 15-20 minutes and the last 5 minutes heat to 220C. Don't forget to turn the fries over after half the time! - Another way to separate the days so they don't all turn into one... is to do 1 thing different everyday. Or try something new. Whether it's cooking a new recipe, walking a new route, listening to a new podcast. - But also.... finding one thing to be grateful for about each day. Something that made you smile, something that made you happy, something you are proud over etc just small things about each day which can make the day better and not make life turn into one blur of days. - And lastly... journaling can also be helpful. A way to process your thoughts and write how you are feeling or how your day has been!! - If you have any other tips, share them down below!! - - - #fries #fryday #potato #potatoes #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #thefeedfeedvegan #tastyfood #foodblogger #vegetarianfood #vegetarianrecipes #worldwidevegan #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #cheapveganfood #vegetarisk #vegetarianrecipe
user_11;user_1159.jpg;"3 types of people when it comes to buddha bowls - or meals in general, am i right...?😂😂 Which one are you? - Organized... all components of the meal unmixed and have their side. - Semi mixed.... just enough to get a little variation with each bite and some sauce for each bite. - Completely mixed and messy - ""everything will just be mixed in the mouth anyway"" so who cares? And throw everything onto a bowl or plate 😅😅 - - The way you plate your food and eat your food says alot about your personality.... or?(this is just a random claim, have done absolutely no research to back this up🤫) - Me.... somewhat of a perfectionist hut still slightly sloppy with minor details🤷‍♀️ Mixed/messy/but still organized. - - - #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vego #nofoodrules #nourishbowls #user_11 #lifestyle #foodfreedom #intuitiveeating #nutritious #healthawareness #healthandwellness #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #forksoverknives #lunch #dinner #food"
user_11;user_1160.jpg;"The use and consumption of oil seems to be a controversial topic on here... especially within the vegan and rawfood community. - 🥑I'll go through the nutrition of oils/dietary fats. - 🍶1. Do you need to use oil? No... as long as you get other healthy fats. But you do restrict yourself unnecessarily as oil in moderation isn't unhealthy. ➡️ If you only eat deep fried foods or use oil for all meals then maybe cutting back is a good idea. - 2. Also, you shouldn't be scared of using oil. It enhances flavour, makes frying easier, can help with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K). - 3. Does oil clog your arteries and make you unhealthy? ➡️ No. There are different types of oil, some better than others. Oils with unsaturated fats can actually be beneficial for heart health as it can help lower LDL cholesterol. - 4. The best oils to use are:olive oil, canola oil, avocado oil, flaxseed oil, sesame oil. - Try to limit use of certain vegetable oils. Soybean, peanut & cornoil - 🥥5. Coconut oil is not a ""superfood"" and doesn't make you magically lose weight. Coconut oil is partially saturated fat which should be kept to a minimum. - 6. Oil is a much better alternative (nutritionally) then butter, margarine or spread as those are saturated fats. Whereas oils are unsaturated fats. - 7. Some oils (rapeseed oil, flaxseed oil, walnut oil) are sources of omega 3 which is positive. However flaxseed oil & walnut oil shouldn't be heated.🌰 - 8. Deep fried food on the regular isn't recommended. However using a little oil to fry or roast food or part of of dressing is no problem. Just maybe be wary of the quantities if you use oil for many of your meals as oil is calorie dense. - 9. If you need to gain weight oil can be helpful! - 10. If you don't want to use oil... that's fine. Just make sure to eat healthy fats everyday. But using some oil while cooking is no big deal... and usually 1-2tbsp is used for 3-4 servings of food so not that much oil anyway. - 11. If you do suffer from gastritis, acid reflux, ibs then high fat meals including lots of oil may want to be limited as it can trigger pain/discomfort. But that will most likely only happen with takeouts/fastfood."
user_11;user_1161.jpg;Vegan ch*cken potato salad with greek white che*se!! Combining all 3 components into 1 😍 - Ok so this might sound strange and not like your usual potato salad but i have to say i really liked this dish. And will definitely be a repeat meal this summer! - To make the potato salad: - Peeled and boiled potatoes until soft (*but not mushy! So choose a firm potato type). Once the potatoes are done, pour away the water and allow to cool. Then chop into smaller pieces. - In the mean time, fry 1 red diced onion and vegan ch*cken pieces( or use tofu/tempeh), until golden brown. - Once those have cooled slightly combine in a big bowl. Add vegan creme fraiche, some mayonnaise, parlsey, crumbled vegan greek cheese, spinach, salt and pepper. & optional a few drops of lemon or apple cider vinegar for a more balanced taste!! - Eat as it is or with a salad on the side. Or why not add to baguettes? 😍😍 - - P.s no measurements as you don't need them for this recipe. Use the amounts you want and then with the sauce i used about (200-300ml creme fraiche, 1-2tbsp mustard, salt/pepper/few drops of ACV) - - Anyone else getting creative in the kitchen at the moment? - #vegan #veganstudent #veganuary #letscookvegan #user_11 #veganfood #lunch #dinner #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #forksoverknives #foodfreedom #realrecovery #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals
user_11;user_1162.jpg;Rainbow buddha bowl with garlic fried tempeh, garlic and thyme potatoes, vegan greek cheese, carrots, red cabbage, cucumber, white bean hummus and a beetroot dressing 🙌 Everything about this meal was amazing 🌱🌱🌱 - The thing i love about buddha bowls is the variety and simplicity of them. - Also buddha bowls can provide (several of your 5-a-day 🌱🌱), lots of different micronutrients that you need as well as all the macronutrients you need (protein, carbs, fat and fibre). - The more varied you eat the more likely you are to get all the nutrients you need so buddhabowls make the perfect nourish bowl. - However if you struggle with IBS or other similar digestive illnesses then buddha bowls may not be the best. 1. Because there is so much fibre and possibly foods that can cause pain or cramps and 2. Usually simple meals are the best to avoid flare ups. - But you can of course make buddha bowls with the foods you tolerate! - When i make my buddhabowls i usually choose a base usually grains or roasted potatoes🥔🥔🍠. A protein source such as tofu or tempeh 🧆. Lots of different veggies. Some healthy fats like avocado, hummus, nuts or seeds🥥🥑. And top it off with some sauce or tahini on top and sometimes extra nuts, seeds or dried fruit! (Tip!🍅🍅🥭 Tomatoes, paprika, mango, carrots are all sources of c-vitamin that will help with the absorption of iron from beans/grains/nuts/dark leafy greens 🌱🌱🥦🥬) - - - #vegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vego #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #balance #buzzfeedtasty #buzzfeedvegan #vegetarianrecipe #nourishbowls #foodfreedom #nutritionadvice #vegannutrition #kostrådgivare #kostvetare #healthyfood
user_11;user_1163.jpg;"GREEN PEA PATTIES 🌱🌱 (recipe below) - Soooo i have been getting requests for more ""home cooked"" no fake meat meals and recipes recently. I understand this as 1) many don't like fake meats, 2) people may not be able to buy fake meats right now and 3) maybe you feel like now is the perfect time to do some cooking from scratch! - I am a fan of fake meats - the texture. Taste. Convenience. Variety and also the nutrition. However they also have alot of sodium which isn't always the best. (Expect a post all about salt and oil coming up soon!). - RECIPE FOR THE PATTIES - Recipe: Arond 150-200g peas (boiled/defrosted) 1x 400g can of chickpeas Salt & pepper 1-2 cloves garlic 1/2 small red onion Around 100g breadcrumbs and sesame seeds (start off with half and add more if necessary) Around 1-2 tbsp flour A few drops of lime (maybe 1 tsp) Oil for frying How to: Begin by boiling the peas. Dice the garlic and onion. In a bowl mix together the peas, chickpeas (minus the aquafaba), garlic and onion. Mix until it is combined – but not so mixed that it turns into hummus. Then add your seasoning of choice – and some salt and pepper. Along with the breadcrumbs… start off with half and add more if necessary. If the mix is too loose, then add some cornstarch or a little flour. Form into patties and coat in a mix of bread crumbs and sesame seeds. EITHER: fry on medium heat – turning over after a few minutes. Or bake in the oven at 200C for about 20-25 minutes (i fried mine, but baking should work!) Eat either warm or cold, works great either way! - Combined with a whitebean hummus and bulgur! - - #vegan #thefeedfeedvegan #forksoverknives #healthycooking #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #food #vegetarianrecipe #valjvego #whatveganseat #plantpowered #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #buddhabowls #nourishbowls #goodoldvegan #vegetarianrecipe #student #homecooked #lunch #buzzfeedtasty"
user_11;user_1164.jpg;"Start the day with a bowl of oats to give you the right energy for your day 😍🙌 *insert oatmeal emoji 🤷‍♀️* - Not everyone is a huge fan of oats... i get that. And if you don't like oats you don't have to eat them. There are plenty of other breakfast ideas and options! Some great breakfast cereals, tofu scramble, fruit salad, smoothies, nice cream, chickpea pancakes, banana bread, yoghurt, breakfast sandwiches, chia pudding and the list goes on 🥞 - There are different types of oatmeal.... some brands i don't like as the oatmeal is too grainy. And other brands of oatmeal result in a very creamy oatmeal.... so test different brands. - And there are different types of oats... 🌱rolled oats (still have their wholegrain), 🌱quick oats (cook alot quicker. Are thinner than rolled oats). 🌱 Instant oats, quick to cook sometimes include sugar or other flavours in the package. 🌱 Steel cut oats, take longer to cook and have a chewier texture. Don't turn out as creamy as rolled oats. - The benefits of oatmeal? - Filled with with fiber which is good for your gut bacteria. Helps with fullness. Can help ""control"" blood sugar as well as decrease LDL cholesterol. However to get ""maximal"" benefits you would need to eat oats regularly and more than just 1 serving 🙌🙌 - Oats are also a source of iron, zinc, magnesium, thiamin and selenium as well as being a source of protein! - A versatile food that can be used in sweet and savoury dishes. Used in baking and even cooking 🙌🌱🌱🤩 - To make oatmeal - don't forget the flavouring example cinnamon, stevia, vanilla and pinch of salt! Or try adding protein powder or chia seeds or even shredded zucchini! Also... cacao, powdered nut butter, berries, banana, coffee are all some flavouring options 🤩🤩 - - #breakfastfood #veganbreakfast #snackbowl #snack #snacks #coconutbowls @coconutbowls #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #healthyfood #tastyfood #plantbasedfood #plantbased #wholefoods #vegansofig #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #bestofvegan #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #nutritionadvice #nutrition #vegannutrition"

user_11;user_1166.jpg;Why do i talk so much about balance and food freedom...? - Well because eating disorders are (unfortunately) so common in todays society. If you don't have one yourself i am sure you know someone who does or has had an eating disorder. - For the person who struggles with an eating disorder or disordered eating, food/weight/body image/exercise takes up so much time of their life. Impacts all areas of their life. - Work. School. Social life. Relationships. - Struggling with an ED or disordered eating can hinder you from reaching your goals. It can hinder you from trying new things or from stepping outside of your comfort zone for new opportunities and experiences . - Low self esteem or low self confidence which can either be a trigger/cause of the ED or a result of an eating disorder can hinder you from believing in yourself and therefore stop you in many ways. - I preach food balance and food freedom because that is what food should be. It shouldn't be something feared, it shouldn't be something that controls your life. It shouldn't be something that dominates your thoughts or your whole life revolves around food/weight/body image. - 🍝 All foods can be part of a healthy balanced diet. - ⚖And balance is different for everyone and even varies at different stages in your life. But the goal should be to find food freedom.... not let food control you. And YOU don't need to control food either...... the more you try to control food and food choices the less control you will have. - 🍉Food is an enjoyment. Foods gives you energy and nourishment so you can live your life. Food is a comfort. But food is not your whole life. - 💡Think how much more time you would have if you didn't let food control you? If all your thoughts and time didn't go towards thoughts of food? Imagine how much more energy you would have when food wasn't a maths problem each time you ate? Imagine where you could be in life when food was something that gave you energy and nourishment... not something that took energy away from you and let you feeling drained of energy due to anxiety and guilt. - You can find food balance and food freedom 🙌 - I love hearing people find their food balance/freedom.🎉
user_11;user_1167.jpg;Happy May 1st 🙌 It's crazy that it is already May..... where has this year even gone? 😲😲 - RECIPE: SMASHED POTATOES: Boil potatoes until tender. Then allow to cool slightly. Place on a baking tray with parchment paper. Smash with a fork or potato masher. Drizzle over salt, parsley, black pepper and oil. Bake in the oven at 220c for 15-20 minutes. Serve warm with your sauce of choice 🙌🙌🙌🤩 - The past 6 weeks has definitely been a standstill when it comes to life, working and reaching goals. The main priority has been taking care of my own health, mental and physical while still continuing with my school work from home and social media. - But now it feels like I'm getting back into the swing of things. - At times like now it's ok to just survive and not be productive. It's ok to take a step back. But now is also a good time to self reflect.... - Is it a relief to no longer go to work? Is the program you are studying a drain of energy and something you no longer enjoy? Have your hobbies become your passion? Have you learnt a new skill or hobby that maybe you would like to pursue? Or maybe you realize that you have worked so hard that taking time off is exactly what you needed? Or maybe you realized that therapy and talking to someone is something you need to continue doing.... or maybe realize that prioritizing your health (mental and physical) is something you need to have a focus on in life. - With every new month i take some time to reflect..... what have i learnt the past month? What have i done the past month? Are my choices in line with what i want in life? - Some months it's just about getting through them... other months i have more time for other projects and goals. Both are ok. But each new month can be a chance for self reflection! Also to set some realistic goals for the upcoming month. - - - #vegan #dinner #recipes #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #veganuary #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #plantpowered #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #foodfreedom #realrecovery #meatlessmonday #potatoes #powerbowl #friday #buzzfeedtasty #food52 #forksoverknives
user_11;user_1168.jpg;Have you heard of eggplant schnitzels before....? If you haven't, well here is a delicious meal idea!! - Thinly slice the eggplant (c.a 1-2cm). Place on a plate and pour over some salt. This draws out some of the liquid which helps make them crispier. - In the mean time, peel, chop and roast some root vegetables you have at home. I seasoned with garlic, thyme and black pepper! - After about 30 minutes, rinse the eggplant slices/dap away the salt. In 1 bowl pour aquafaba. In another bowl, mix bread crumbs and sesame seeds as well as salt, black pepper and some chilli powder or garlic powder. - Dip the eggplant into the aquafaba before dipping into the breadcrumb mix. Place on a tray with parchment paper. Repeat. - Bake the eggplant slices in the oven at 200C for about 20-25 minutes. Turn the slices over after half the time. - For the sauce i just mixed together oat creme fraiche, beetroot juice, balsamic vinegar and tiny bit of mustard! - This was SOOO good.😍😍 I hope you're all doing ok and staying healthy! - - - #vegan #dinner #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #veganuary #letscookvegan #user_11 #veganfoodvideo #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #buddhabowls #whatthehealth #forksoverknives #worldwidevegan #f52grams #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #buzzfeedvegan #vegetarianrecipe #meatfreemeals #plantpowered

Filling. Fibre rich. Plenty of iron. Protein rich. - And you can also do a 50/50 of soya mince and lentilmix👌👌 If you are someone who wants to cook from scratch this is a good recipe. You can also make your own cheese sauce either based on cashews and nutritional yeast... or even a tofu based cheese.

user_11;user_1172.jpg;This is what i call good mood food.....why? Because it puts me in a good mood when i eat it 😂 Especially combined with good music on in the background and just maaybbbbe a glass of red wine on the side 🤫 - RECIPE: - Boil spaghetti according to instructions (the chance of boiling more spaghetti than necessary is 100% 😅). Also boil in VERY salty water. - In a frying pan, fry 4 garlic cloves, 1 red onion (diced), vegan ch*cken pieces and chickpeas. Fry for 6-7 minutes until crispy. - Once the pasta is boiled, pour away 4/5 of the water. Pour the spaghetti into the frying pan along with some of the pasta water. Add frozen peas as well as around 500ml vegan oat cream. (Other plantbased cream work as well). - Allow to simmer for 5-10 minutes. Season with salt and LOTS of blackpepper. - Once creamy, serve warm! This makes a great mealprep as you can cook a huge batch, lasts great in the fridge as well as tastes fine to freeze and then reheat. - Changes - use bean spaghetti for higher protein. Switch vegan chicken for tofu, tempeh or omit. You can make this a tomato based dish by using less oatcream and instead choosing crushed tomatoes. - - - #vegan #mealprep #veganmealprep #letscookvegan #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #pasta #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #f52grams #forksoverknives #foodfreedom #intuitiveeating #nutritionadvice #healthcoach #tasty
user_11;user_1173.jpg;Love coffee but don't want your family to know you are already drinking your 3rd cup in the morning.... add some coffee to your oats and make chocolate/coffee oatmeal 😉😉 - This is a favourite oatmeal combo of mine and love adding vanilla and coconut shreds ontop 🙌 - It should of course be noted... if you suffer from anemia or low iron levels i wouldn't recommend doing this as both cacao and coffee lower the absorption of iron from the oats. So.... instead drink your coffee 1-2 hours before or after eating oatmeal (or your main meals). And add some berries, mango or fruit to your oatmeal to increase the absorption of iron. - ALSO if you didn't know... calcium actually inhibits/lowers the amount of iron absorbed. So drinking milk to your main meals or eating dairy products with your main meals and you are iron deficient is not the best idea. Instead consume it in snacks/not part of your main meals. - ➡️ if you have normal iron levels then it is nothing to worry about. Those are just small changes you can make in your diet if you do have low iron levels. For diagnosed anemia, then supplements is usually required as it is difficult to improve your iron levels enough just through diet (even if it's not impossible), your body may not be absorbing as much iron as it should no matter how much iron you consume. - - #vegan #food #nutritionadvice #nutrition #vegannutrition #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vego #vegetarianrecipe #meatfreemeals #breakfastlover #breakfast #oatmeal #coconutbowls #coconutbowl #user_11 #lifestyle #foodfreedom #intuitiveeating
user_11;user_1174.jpg;🚩FOOD RULES and EATING STRUGGLES🚩 - Today i want to address some of the food rules/eating struggles that i struggled with for a long time in recovery.... struggles/rules that maybe not everyone talks about. ➡️ but these rules/struggles definitely controlled me and limited my food freedom... fears and anxieties which i had to overcome. And i want to tell you that if you struggle with them as well, you do need to change your behaviour, mindset and habits to overcome them. ➡️ Face those fears and anxieties.🙌🙌 - 🚩Not being able to eat with/around others that weren't my family. I felt ashamed, embarrasssed and awkward eating with others so would eat alone or eat/before after. - 🚩Not being able to say/tell others i was hungry. I saw it as a weakness. I was embarrassed. I would sit silently in hunger to ashamed to say i was hungry. - 🚩Not eating seconds or eating the portion i wanted to eat. There was a portion size i deemed ok and i couldn't eat more than that regardless of hunger. - 🚩I was ashamed to buy certain foods in the store even if i craved them... and i was too embarrassed to tell others (ex. My family) that i was craving the specific food. So my embarrassment/anxiety/fear of being judged would stop me from eating a food i wanted. - These were all food rules. Fears and anxieties around food that many might (but hopefully not) relate to. It's important to bring awareness to them. - Don't ever feel embarrassed about eating or buying certain foods. Don't be embarrassed or ashamed about your hunger or food cravings. It's ok to be hungry. It's ok to want to eat more. It's ok to crave certain foods. - If you struggle with these/relate to these ➡️ 1. Realize they are food rules and hold you back. 2. Face those fears. Nothing bad will happen. No one is judging you i promise 💕💕 - - #health #nutritionadvice #foodfreedom #realrecovery #meatlessmonday #kost #kostrådgivare #kostvetare #plantpowered #vegannutrition #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #mindfuleatingtips #intuitiveeating #diet #foodrules #nofoodrules #healthyfood #healthyeating #healthpromotion #healthawareness #healthandwellness
user_11;user_1175.jpg;"50 shades of plants 😂Throwback to this meal i ate a few weeks ago because i really haven't been doing so much cooking recently. A whole lot of lentil soup, one pot pasta, buddha bowls, canned beans and frozen veggies 😁 Even if i am a foodie i don't always feel like cooking 🙄 - This meal consists of garlic roasted eggplant, beetroot hummus, mashed sweet potato, pickled onion and tomatoes ➡️ A weird veggie bowl so to say 😁 - Many people think that dietitians/nutritionists always eat super ""healthy"" i.e only vegetables and lean protein. And i often get asked ""how often do i eat X or Y?"" - And i am here to tell you that 1) dietitians/nutritionists are only human as well and many enjoy eating all types of food. If I'm honest, getting my degree in nutrition and health promotion helped me find better balance with food. To not be scared of eating X,Y,Z. The less i knew about food and nutrition the more fears and worries i had about it. - And 2) what, how or when someone else eats X,Y or Z is irrelevant to you. Of course it can be a comfort to hear that this person or that person also eats chocolate 3 times a week or eats pizza every week. But you also have to focus on what is best for you... eat the foods you want to eat. Eat the foods you enjoy and are nutritious for you. Everyone eats differently and you don't need approval or an ""ok"" from someone else 👌👌 If you want to eat X or Y.... do it. Try to find YOUR balance and moderation with eating and food. - Some want chocolate only on the weekends others want a little chocolate everyday... whatever works for you. There is no right or wrong. - #vegan #veganstudent #veganuary #buildabuddhabowl #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #food #bestofvegan #foodblogger #foodfredom #mealprep #food #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetarianfood #veganrecipes #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday"

If it's split red lentils i add after 10 minutes. - Once slightly soft i add the split red lentils, 1 can crushed tomatoes, garlic, onion, chilli, salt and pepper. Allow to boil for another 10 minutes until soft and the right texture. - Optional, add some chickpeas and/or other vegetables. - Top with some salted nuts, cilantro, vegan sour cream or oat fraiche 🙌 And pairing it with home made naan bread or garlic bread is a plus 👌👌 - - This is definitely a meal you'll go back for seconds... or maybe that's just me 😉 - Happy Friday everyone 💕💕 - - - #vegan #mealprep #veganmealprep #letscookvegan #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vego #forksoverknives #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #icastudent #user_11 #buzzfeedtasty #buzzfeedvegan
user_11;user_1177.jpg;"Bringing back the buddha bowls and nice cream 😍😍 This time my bowl is filled with rice noodles, mango, smoked tofu (@yipin.se ), rocket, tomatoes, salted peanuts and a type of dressing (don't ask for the recipe 😅). - I LOVE. LOVE. LOVE these types of meals. This is my type of ""feel good"" meal. You know that type of meal where you are just like ""i just LOVE FOOD and LOVE eating"". The type of meal where you wish you had unlimited stomach space to eat even more of the meal? Yeah... that's how i feel when i eat buddha bowls and sweet potato fries. - Granted... the majority of my meals that i eat/cook i get that feeling of ""i just love food and eating so much"". But other meals its just eating for nourishment or eating because I'm hungry and eating what i have at home. - But i don't understand people who have no joy about eating food..... it's almost like a chore. Like something they force themselves to do because they have to. And i have infact dated several people (not at once 😅) who said they would like to just take a pill to give them the nourishment they need and not have to eat.... Can you guess why things didn't work out 😂 - Find joy in food. Find joy in eating. Even if food shouldn't be your main enjoyment in life or the only thing that makes you happy.

user_11;user_1178.jpg;"If you've got some bananas sitting in your kitchen, slowly turning brown and you're tired of making banana bread....? Then slices the bananas, place in freezer bags and freeze over night.

If this doesn't scream summer i don't know what does.... well aside from watermelon 🙌🙌 - - Also let's ""talk"" carbs.... carbs at night... eating carbs for several meals. - Far too often i get messages from individuals wondering if they can eat carbs in the evening. Or not allowing themselves to eat carbs (such as bread or pasta) more than once a day. If you recognize yourself in this then... - 1. Ask yourself why can you not eat X food more than once a day? Why can't you eat bread for both breakfast and lunch? What would be wrong with that....? Nothing is the answer. - 2. Your body doesn't know time and you don't have to cut carbs after 6pm. Total calories over time is what matters. Not what time you eat what foods. However it of course isn't recommended to eat foods that spike your energy right before bed as that will make it hard to sleep. So skip the soda and sugared candy right before bed 👌 But oatmeal can actually help you sleep better. - 3. Ask yourself where you got those nutrition myths... why you are scared of breaking them and what would happen if you do? - 4. Your body needs carbohydrates, just like it needs protein, fibre and fat. Just in different amounts. Carbohydrates give you energy, help you feel full and satisfied and shouldn't be skipped. - 5. Also if you workout in the morning eat extra carbs for dinner can give you more energy for your morning work outs 👌 - Listen to your body. Eat carbs and not just veggies. Face those irrational fear foods 💕 Life is so much better without them and without controlling thoughts about food. - - #health #nutritionadvice #nutrition #vegannutrition #healthyfood #nicecream #coconutbowls #summer #summerfood #vegetarianrecipe #snack #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #bestofvegan #tasty #kost #kostrådgivare #food52 #goodoldvegan #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vegetarisk #vegan"

user_11;user_1180.jpg;Easy quarantine meal to make! ➡️ Homemade falafel (chickpeas, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, parsley, a little flour. Mix. Form. Bake or fry!). Home made hummus and roasted veggies, a mix of frozen and fresh 😍😍 - A 900g bag of dried chickpeas can go a looonnnngggg way! 😍 And i would say, if you can tolerate and digest chickpeas then they should definitely be a regular part of your diet. Providing so many nutrients (protein, carbs, fibre, iron, calcium, magnesium, b6 etc). ➡️ And can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes. - Of course not everyone can tolerate beans or peas, and i would suggest you 1. Slowly increase your intake of them 2. Make sure they are soft when you eat them. If they're still slightly hard they may be undercooked which can lead to digestive issues. 3. If possible, remove the skin of chickpeas 4. Test different beans and peas to see which you like and tolerate the best 👌👌👌 - - - #vegan #veganfoodshare #buddhabowl #buddhabowls #cheapvegan #cheapveganfood #studenteats #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #bestofvegan #healthyfood #tastyfood #tasty #food #recipes #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #food52 #worldwidevegan #dinner #vegandinner #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered
user_11;user_1181.jpg;What's your favourite (vegan!) food to grill/bbq? 😍😍 - The first really sunny/summery day today and it's got me longing for vegan bbq meals!! Different vegetable skewers, corn on the cob, began burgers, vegan smores or grilled banana with chocolate 😍😍 I mean food generally tastes better when enjoyed outside in the sun with friends/family, am i right? - For now I'll have to satisfy that craving with roasted veggies at home. - Hasselback potatoes, roasted carrots, onion, tomato, haricot verts and asparagus 😍 A very satisfying plate of vegetables and exactly what i want to eat right now🙄🙄 But filming a full day of eating today which you will see sometime soon on my YT 🙌 - 🚩🚩Roasted all the veggies in the oven at 200C.

user_11;user_1182.jpg;Baked cauliflower-spinach pasta 🙌🙌 Sharing how i made this down below and also some adaptions on how you can make it even better if you have the ingredients at home! - First off... you can make this in individual glass jars if you are meal prepping and don't want to make it in a large form. Second. Works great to be frozen and reheated 🙌🙌 - How to: Par boil pasta of choice (i used regular pasta and around 350g?). If using fresh cauliflower, dice and add to the pasta. - Add cauliflower and spinach to the pasta after 3-4 minutes and allow to defrost. Season with salt, pepper, garlic. - Pour away the pasta water when parboiled (semi soft) and pour the pasta in a baking tray. - In a pot, melt c.a 2 tbsp vegan margarine and add 2tbsp flour to the melted margarine. Stir until mixed. Then gradually pour in around 500ml oat cream (or other cooking cream. Note! Oat milk works as well if you want to use grated cheese in the pasta). ➡️ Season with some garlic powder, salt, pepper, (alternatively some rosemary/thyme/parsley). - Pour the cream mixture over the pasta. !!add some grated vegan cheese as well if you want!!. Also top with some crumbled tofu and bread crumbs if you have at home. - Cover the form with some foil and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 200C. - Eat... enjoy.... let me know if you try this baked pasta!🙌🙌 - - Note - use whatever pasta and veggies you like. Oat cream can be changed to oat milk. Use oil instead of margarine if you want.

user_11;user_1183.jpg;The way you think about food matters. - The way you talk about food matters. - The way you think about yourself and what you say about yourself matters. - Make sure your thoughts and words about yourself and food are positive. Talk about yourself like you would with a friend. Think kind thoughts about yourself like you would with a friend. - It's hard to love yourself if you're always thinking negative thoughts about yourself. - It's hard to appreciate and enjoy food if you always say/think to yourself that a certain food is bad. Or reinforce the feelings of guilt and anxiety when you eat a certain food. - And when it comes to food and talking about food.... realize that what you say can impact others. Saying foods are bad. Saying foods are unhealthy. Saying you should avoid certain foods... how could/would those comments effect those you are talking to? What consequences could that have? - In the past i used to say i didn't like certain foods. I didn't like crisps. I didn't like cake. I didn't like candy. I didn't like pasta. I didn't like potatoes. I didn't like bread. I didn't like cheese. I didn't like sauce. You know what... it might have been me unconsciously talking about those foods in a negative way because they were still fear foods. -- GRANTED. Some foods i like but they aren't my favourite. Or some foods i like but a small amount is enough to satisfy that craving. And of course some foods i just don't like despite trying over and over..... you don't need to like all foods. And NO you don't have to like the foods mentioned above....

And if you do..m consider adding some beans and veggies to your tacos and maybe switching minced meat to soy mince every now and then 🙌🙌 - Instead of thinking: healthy or unhealthy meal.

THIS 😍 I don't know what i was expecting but i wasn't angry at the result. - This pb/coconut sauce with tempeh, roasted garlic green beans, rice noodles and crunchy peanuts on top. - HOW TO: ➡️Fry tempeh in some oil along with half a diced red onion and crushed garlic.

I grew up with a mum who always freestyled so that is my type of cooking.

If not... it's time you do. Not only is it filled with fiber, also protein rich, complex carbs and iron.

So the best is to EXPERIMENT. Use this as a base recipe and vary it depending on what you like :) ▪︎ How to: Mash the chickpeas with a fork. Add in the relish/capers (or both), celery/sweet corn. Drizzle over the lemon juice along with salt and pepper. Add the creme fraiche/mayonnaise and mix until combined.

There is alot more time for cooking and i can cook one large batch of a meal and freeze in or eat for several days until i cook again. - BUT mealprepping does help save time. Helps save money. I don't have to think about what to eat - instead just eat what i have already prepared, unless i am seriously craving another dish.

Or pick up an old hobby which you suddenly have time for? Or if you are entrepreneurial start with that business or first step towards your new goal career? - But sometimes before you can actually pursue a career or pursue your lifelong goals you need to take a step back and take care of your mental and physical health.

And they store great in the freezer or fridge... that is, if they last longer than 48 hours - INGREDIENTS: c.a 200g vegan chocolate 90ml coconut milk (well mixed – or use just the coconut cream part) Optional (but recommend!) some vanilla powder or why not some chilli powder, liquorice or some sea salt! Cacao powder to cover in - HOW TO: Begin by grating or chopping the chocolate finely – the smaller pieces, the easier it melts. Measure out c.a 90ml coconut milk and heat in the microwave on full heat for c.a 30-45 seconds. It should be warm, but not boiling. Then pour the coconut milk over the chocolate and cover with a plate or towel, to trap the heat in. Allow to stand for 3-5 minutes. Then stir slightly, to make sure the chocolate is fully melted – if not, heat in the microwave in ten second sessions until melted. Place in the fridge and allow to chill for atleast 3-5+ hours. Once the mix has chilled and hardened (should be solid), you can roll it into balls and cover in ex. cacao powder, crushed nuts, coconut shreds etc Eat and enjoy! - - #vegan #easter #påsk #chocolatelover #chocolate #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #thefeedfeedvegan #realrecovery #recoverywarriors #plantbasedfood #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #whatthehealth #forksoverknives

I think both ""normal"", sugarfree and rawfood balls/bars can have their place in a healthy diet. I think it is great with different alternatives. - You don't have to fear sugar or calories. Of course calories ""matter"" but so does nutrition. And at the end of the day fearing foods or feeling guilty about eating certain foods can be more unhealthy than just eating the food you are craving and moving on. 😎 - I've seen many online who eat sugar free candy to be healthy but skip fruit and rawfoods because they deem them unhealthy.... 🙄 If this is you i would really question why you choose to eat low kcal options and whether your view on health and nutrition is just low kcal=healthy? - P.S IF YOU SAY YOU DON'T LIKE CANDY... BUT EAT SUGAR FREE CANDY then yess... you do like candy, you're just scared of sugar.... - This Easter - and all year round. Eat the candy form you enjoy.🍬🍭 - And remember low kcal doesn't necessarily mean healthy just like high call doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy. It's about the amount and how often you eat different foods. - And remember - don't skip meals just because you're going to eat candy/chocolate.

user_11;user_1194.jpg;"And that's a wrap for the school week 🤔🤔😉 I made these ""seafood"" wraps for lunch the previous day and they were so tasty they were gone in 10 minutes 😂 - I made a tofu ""skagenröra"" which is basically a tofu mix with vegan caviar, dill, onion. And first time trying @aoasverige vegan salmon made from seitan. - If there is one thing i can get cravings for from time to time is actually fish and specially salmon. I think it's usually my bodies way of telling me i need more omega 3... or more fat in my diet. So by adding more plantbased omega 3 alternatives (walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds)that craving goes away. ➡️ Also by making tofu fish, buying vegan fish-less fillets/fish fingers which give that fishy taste it also helps. 🐟 - Otherwise there is no food i miss as a vegan and if i ever get super strong cravings for something i know it's my bodies way of telling me i may need more of a certain vitamin or mineral 🙌🙌👌 Of course this may not always be easy for someone to figure out, especially not if you aren't aware of nutrition and different vitamins/minerals. ➡️ Othertimes strong cravings can be a sign of something else and doing tests to see what it may be can be helpful! - Hope you all have a lovely weekend 💛💛 - - - #vegan #veganstudent #veganuary #letscookvegan #user_11 #veganfood #healthycooking #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #healthyrecipes #veganfish #forksoverknives #worldwidevegan #f52grams #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #easycooking #easter #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tastyfood"

Whether that means sugar free ice cream, rawfood cakes or regular carrot cake with extra frosting. - ➡️ Its about finding your balance, eating food you enjoy, nourishing body and mind and not feeling guilty over any of the food or amount you eat. - It's not about healthy/unhealthy, sugar/sugar free, raw/vegan.... just about balance and guilt free eating. - - - #vegan #easter #easterfood #påsk #påskmat #cake #snackbowl #snacking #dessert #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #healthyfood #buzzfeedtasty #food52 #healthyrecipes #vegetarianrecipe #dairyfree #instafood #carrotcake #dessert #veganbaking"
user_11;user_1197.jpg;"It is tiring to be at war with yourself.... it is tiring to constantly think negative thoughts about yourself. To always compare yourself to everyone else.... to always bring yourself down. ➡️The world is tough enough as it is and you don't need to make it harder for yourself. - You can't hate yourself happy. You can't hate yourself to self love. Instead you need to change your thoughts and mindset.. - 🚫It is so easy to criticize yourself... your body... your personality... your capabilities.... so easy to think everyone else is better and looks better than you. - 🥑Imagine how befreeing it would be to not spend so much time, energy or thoughts worrying about your body. To not always worry or think about the way you looked? To not analyze your body everytime you walk past the mirror? To not have to overthink everything you eat and eat to nourish your body and mind not just to eat low kcal and control your body image. - 🏃‍♀️Imagine how befreeing it would be to workout for health, happiness, energy and endorphins... not because you want to punish yourself for what you have eaten or because you want to control the way your body looks - 🧘‍♀️What if you learnt to love your body. Accept your body and not let it hold you back? What if you focused on other things.... imagine how much more time and energy you would have when all your thoughts didn't just go to food, body image and exercise? - 🍎It is possible to reach a stage and mental state where your body is just your body... you ACCEPT IT. Maybe you don't love it everyday.... maybe you don't always think you look great, but you still take care of your body. You still nourish yourself and know that you are more than your body. - You accept that cellulite, scars, stretch marks, acne, spots and belly rolls are ok and normal. You don't let them define you. Of course EASIER SAID THAN DONE. ➡️ but the less time you spend infront of the mirror, the less time you spend comparing yourself to others, the less time you spend on social media looking at other peoples bodies and the more time you spend in ""real life"", working, learning, having fun, making memories.... the less time and energy you have to analyse your body."

user_11;user_1199.jpg;THE BEST ROASTED POTATOES 🙌🙌 Once you make these potatoes you won't want to eat them any other way 😅 Not quite as simple as just chopping and roasting... but worth the extra work because they are amazing 🥔🥔 - HOW TO: Peel and half potatoes (i used 900g potatoes) and parboil. I.e boiled in water for about 5-6 minutes until slightly soft. - Preheat oven to 200C. Once the potatoes are parboiled, pour away the water and pour the potatoes into a baking form. Pour over some salt, pepper and parsley. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Then take out of the oven. - Melt some vegan butter or margarine (estimate around 60ml... i didn't measure). Add crushed garlic, parsley and a little more salt. Pour over the potatoes, turning the potatoes over so they are fully coated. And then back into the oven for 10-15 minutes. Take out when crispy 😍😍 - Note... feel free to add bread crumbs or vegan parmesan to the potatoes as well! - Combine with your favourite sauce... such as a garlic and lemon creme fraiche mix or why not a lemony tahini sauce? 🙌🙌 - Raise your hands if you love potatoes 🙌🙌🙌 These are perfect for breakfast...lunch...dinner....snack 😅 More potatoes to the people am i right? - - - #potato #potatoes #easter #vegan #food #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #veganuary #valjvego #whatveganseat #healthyfood #tastyfood #plantbasedfood #plantbaseddinner #forksoverknives #tasty #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #wfpb #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #govegan #meatfreemeals #mealprepbyizzy #thefeedfeedvegan
user_11;user_11100.jpg;Jumbo apple chai oats..... that will be a yes from me 🍎🍎🍏 Are you a sweet or savoury breakfast person.... or maybe not a breakfast person at all? - To make these oats i added rolled oats, water, 1 small apple (diced) cinnamon, cardamum, vanilla into a pot and then added two chai tea bags to the pot and boiled. Taking out the tea bags just before the oats get too sticky. - But you can also boil water (around 150ml) and add the two teabags making a really strong tea... and then use that instead of just normal water when cooking your oats. Or why not heat mylk, add the teabags and let soak. And then make overnight oats using thay chai mylk? - Just coming up with lots of different ideas and inspiration when i write this post😂😂 - New week ... new goals? My plans this week are to get my assignments done, cook some easter inspired recipes, try to edit 1-2 YouTube videos (if my computer will allow me 😅😅), do some outside workouts 👌👌 What are your plans this week? - - - #vegan #breakfastfood #veganbreakfast #snack #snacks #vegansnacks #breakfast #veganbreakfastideas #whatveganseat #plantpowered #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #coconutbowls @coconutbowls #bestofvegan #buddhabowls #whatthehealth
user_11;user_11101.jpg;Sunday mealprep.... or maybe i should call it Sunday #pantrycheck because that is pretty much what it is.... checking what i have at home and making the best out of it. - And the result this Sunday was a lentil bolognese (?) which turned into more of a soup. Garlic haricot verts and pasta. - Note the lentil and sweet potato soup is delicious as it is and doesn't need to be combined with the pasta. Infact it would work even better with some of the panfried bread i posted the previous day 👌👌 - For lentil bolognese it is better to use whole red lentils and not split red lentils like i used this time. The whole red lentils give more texture and don't become as mushy. - For the soup i just boiled sweet potato and carrots in vegetable stock and water for about 10 minutes. Added the red lentils along with green peas, 400ml crushed tomatoes, crushed garlic, salt and black pepper. Allowed to cook for another 10 minutes until soft. And then done. ➡️ The thing about this soup is that you can add whatever veggies you have at home! - To make lentil bolognese - use whole red lentils, less water, fry some onion and garlic. And also add some beans or corn to the mix. You can find an actual recipe for this on my blog! - - #vegan #meatlessmonday #mealprep #veganmealprep #letscookvegan #mealprepbyizzy #mealprepping #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #healthyrecipes #veganrecipes #vegansofig #recipes #lunch #tasty #thefeedfeedvegan #wfpb #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #wholefoodsplantbased

user_11;user_11103.jpg;0 calorie foods.... really not sure why that is a thing?🤔 - 🚫There are no foods with negative or 0 calories..... and also no foods that magically burn fat. - The problem with these 0 calorie foods - or the fitness foods(?)is that it is often those who claim to be health conscious who eat them....who prefer 0 calorie noodles to actual noodles or prefer 0 calorie sauces to actual sauces (even homemade ones). I've been that person in the past.🙅‍♀️ - But let's get back to basics..... we need to eat for ENERGY, for NUTRIENTS. - Of course... in todays society we eat for other reasons such as due to social interactions, comfort, emotions, taste... - And not everything we eat has to be 100% optimal nutritious - that in turn can be an obsession. It's ok to eat something just because it's tasty or because it gives you some sort of comfort/joy from time to time🍨 - But eating 0 calorie foods doesn't make sense as it doesn't provide your body or mind with anything than fullness. - And feeling full is not the same as feeling satisfied after a meal. Especially not if you have just filled up on veggies/low kcal foods... you will soon get cravings and is not a long term solution. - If you do need to decrease your energy intake then it would be far better using vegetables as an alternative or doing 50/50 as i have recommended before.... instead of opting for 0 calorie noodles, sauces, bars, rice etc - The most important thing is to ask yourself why you eat them.... or why you choose the food with lowest calories? Is there a legitimate reason (and yes, for some there is.) For others... it's based on fear. ➡️ Being honest with yourself about why you make the choices you do is important.🙄 - If you enjoy 0 calorie foods - go for it..... if you don't... why are you eating them?🤔 - CALORIES AREN'T BAD. CALORIES AREN'T EVIL. We all need calories and they are nothing to fear - but of course we all need different calorie amounts. But it's the amount you eat of certain foods that matters. - When you eat it is a chance to nourish your body and mind, to give you energy to live life/function as a human - so choose meals/snacks that give you that energy and nourishment(🍫 included) -

user_11;user_11105.jpg;The more hummus the better... right? 😂😂😅 Friday night snacks sorted 😉 - To make the hummus... i first peeled the chickpeas (getting rid of the outer shell). Putting the chickpeas in cold water and rubbing them helped. Then in my food processor added the chickpeas, tahini, 3 garlic cloves, salt, pepper, lemon juice, some oil and cold water. Mixed for 3-5 minutes. Gradually adding more oil and water until the right texture was reached. - For the no yeast panfried bread i mixed together: - 130g (c.a 3dl) white whole wheat flour plus extra for rolling.3/4tsp baking powder Pinch of salt sea salt 1/2 tsp ground garlic powder Pinch black pepper 15ml oil 120ml aquafaba (you can use water) & topped the bread in some vegan spread and parsley before frying **note save some extra flour for when your forming the bread  Mix together the dry ingredients. Add the oil and aquafaba (or water). Mix until a dough starts to form. If it is still too sticky add more flour... if it's too dry, add a little more liquid. Note you don't want the mix too dry as then it will just taste like a dry dough clump when eating 😂😂😅🙈 Knead the dough for a few minutes on a floured surface. - Form into 2-3 small balls and then flatten to make your flatbread. Add a little vegan spread and chopped parsley on each side of the bread. - In a frying pan add the bread pieces and fry until golden brown on each side - use medium heat so they don't burn! - Eat and enjoy! - - I'm not a huge fan of celery but when eaten with hummus it makes it SO MUCH BETTER 🙌 - - - #vegan #recipe #hummus #veganrecipes #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #veganfoodvideo #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #food52 #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tastyfood #plantpowered #healthyfood #valjvego #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #food #tasty #wfpb
user_11;user_11106.jpg;Another day... and another way to eat potatoes 😅 If you ever have potatoes and don't know what to do with them... send me a message and I'll give you plenty of ideas 😂 - Baked potatoes which i stuffed with roasted chickpeas, blackbeans, sweet corn, salsa and guacamole 🥑🥑🍠 - A recipe video will be coming up on my YouTube when i make these..... but it's not so hard to guess how i make😁 - And the question of which type of potato is better.... white or sweet potato? The answer is choose the one you prefer. Mix it up from time to time. They're a great source of carbohydrates, providing energy and nourishment as well as being delicious! - TIP! If you don't have access to an oven you can bake sweet potato in the microwave for 7-8 minutes at top temperature! - - - #vegan #veganfoodshare #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tastyfood #plantpowered #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #healthyrecipes #veganrecipes #vegansofig #whatveganseat #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #thefeedfeedvegan #tasty #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday
user_11;user_11107.jpg;Worried about gaining weight while on quarantine? Feeling guilty for eating without exercising? Worrying about eating too much? - I understand that these can be worries for some people right now... but at the same time, if these are your main worries you may just need to reprioritize your thoughts and realise that there are far worse things that can happen than just gaining weight. - Right now there are far more concerning and worrying issues than whether you gain weight or not. And a good thing to ask yourself is.... so what if you gain weight, does it really matter? - The important thing is to keep yourself, those you love and those most vulnerable safe. As well as minimizing the amount of individuals in need of urgent care. - If you are struggling with food, weight, exercise addiction and/or guilt around these the now is a good time to challenge those fears. - Focus on other hobbies... writing, reading, learning a new language, drawing, starting a new project, finding a new series to immerse yourself in. - Write out your thoughts. Journal. Face your fears. - But also take contact with a therapist/dietitian/psychologist online. Use this time in quarantine to focus on your mental health, challenge these fears holding you back. Take that step to talk to someone or make changes which longterm will make you healthier. - I know times are tough and many may fall back into negative coping mechanisms... but if you notice that happening-make a change to not let yourself fall deeper. - Nourish your body and mind. Talk with those you love. Be kind to yourself. Practise self love. Journal. Reach out for help. And know that your body and mind needs nourishment everyday no matter you do or don't do. - And you are amazing regardless of weight or size 💕 - Don't restrict. Don't self deprive. Find healthy coping mechanisms. Exercise for health - not guilt or anxiety. Eat for enjoyment and nourishment. Throw out the scale. Think nice thoughts about yourself daily 💕💕 - - #health #healthy #foodfreedom #realrecovery #intuitiveeating #mindfuleating #healthyfood #vegan #plantbased #wfpb #kostrådgivare #kostvetare #plantpowered #veganfood #veganstudent #nutritionadvice #nutrition
user_11;user_11108.jpg;Vegetable casserole and garlic toast/bread? 😍😍🙌 - Quickly whipped this together by: Thinly dicing the veggies i had at home: Parsnips, carrots, aubergine, onion and garlic. Threw into a baking pan. Drizzled over some oil, salt, pepper and parsley. Into the oven at 220C for 15 minutes. Then took out of the oven, poured over the tomato sauce and back into the oven for 20 minutes. - In the mean time i mixed together vegan spread, 3 garlic cloves (crushed), salt, pepper and parsley. Put a generous amount on each piece of bread and baked in the oven about 4-5 minutes. - And there you have a simple meal to make for a garlic lover (like myself 😅😁). - Note... add some tofu, soya pieces or beans to the casserole if you like!!

user_11;user_11110.jpg;It's Sunday... the last day of the week... maybe you're staring into your pantries and fridge wondering what to make with the last of the ingredients you have? Well here is a throw together meal i made earlier this week. - Potato salad (boil potatoes, once boiled and cooled down mix together with creme fraiche, a bit of mustard, parlsey, chives, red onion, salt and pepper. Thin it out with some oat cooking cream or vegan mayonnaise). - Roasted chickpeas: place chickpeas on a baking tray with parchment paper. Drizzle over some oil as well as salt and seasoning of choice (example garlic, onion, paprika and chilli). Bake in the oven at 200C for 25 minutes or until crunchy. - Homemade tortilla chips: chop tortilla bread into small chips (i get about 8 per tortilla). Place chips on a baking tray with parchment paper. Don't overcrowd the baking tray. Drizzle over a little salt and oil on the chips. Bake in the oven for 5-6 minutes - turning over after half the time. Take out and allow to cool slightly! - Add your favourite veggies or salad. Eat and enjoy. - Maybe not the standard meal you see.... but hey, when you are avoiding going to the food store or just want to get better at using what you have at home before buying more... then this is the type of meals that are created and eaten 🙂🙂😀 - - - #vegan #food #mealprep #veganstudent #veganmealprep #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #wholefoodsplantbased #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthy #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #bestofvegan #potatoes #potatosalad #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #cheapfood #cheapeats #svinnsmart
user_11;user_11111.jpg;"MINDFUL EATING? - Do you constantly eat your meals while distracted? Always eat while working? Or maybe mindlessly eat throughout the whole day?🤳👩‍💻 - 🍽First off... mindless eating(?) or distracted eating is normal in todays society. If you have had a restrictive eating disorder in the past, being able to mindlessly eat can be a good thing as it means you can eat without rules. But for some... becoming more present when eating, taking the time to eat in peace and without distractions and listen to your body can be a very good idea. - 🔇📖Now if you are social distancing and/or on lockdown it can also be a good time to try to focus on mindful eating. Being present at your meal times. Having clear mealtimes meaning you *hopefully* sit at a table (i.e not standing by a counter eating all your meals everyday). - 🐿🍝Mindful eating helps you be more present when eating. Helps you better listen to your body. You can enjoy the food more and might eat slower and feel fuller after the meal. - 🎶Of course mindful eating, or eating without distractions isn't always possible. Such as when working or in school or if you have kids or don't have time to just sit and eat. But try to make it a habit to do it a few times a week.... to make yourself a delicious meal and give yourself time to eat it and not have any distractions.... well aside from maybe music, podcasts or sitting and eating with others. - 🤔🤔Mindful eating can also involve - getting in touch with your feelings when eating. Asking yourself how you feel, how the food makes you feel, why you choose to eat what you did. This can be useful for SOME... but not everyone. ➡️ overthinking what you eat and how it makes you feel can sometimes be obsessive and controlling or if you have fear/anxiety around food it can make you feel pains/cramps/stomach ache just from the food anxiety and guilt and not actual ""pain"". - 📵I do recommend mindful eating especially if you are someone who struggles with binge eating, overeating and/or emotional or stresseating. Just becoming more present at meals times as well as eating REGULAR mealtimes throughout the day. 🍽 - Next week try mindful eating for atleast one meal 🙌 👌🍽🍴"

user_11;user_11115.jpg;When you're finally allowed out of quarantine/lock down 😅😅😅 OR..... me in the store when someone sneezes directly on me 🤭😲🙄😔 Apparently some people haven't been following the news and think that's an acceptable thing to do. - I know many are struggling right now for so many different reasons... worried, anxious, stressed, lonely, worried for loved ones or the uncertainty of how things will be in the future. But remember that this current situation won't last forever. I want to say things will go back to normal but the truth is no one knows that right now... - Instead try to focus on making the best out of each day. Find small things each day that make life good. Even if it's just watching your favourite show, talking to a family member, eating your favourite food or cuddling your pet. Those small things in life matter. - On another note.... hopefully my easy recipes and nutrition advice or something that can be useful to many of you now. Quick pantry meals. Using frozen foods, beans and lentils. But most of all reminding you to not let food, exercise or food guilt take up too much (or any) of your thoughts right now. ➡️ There are far more important things to worry about than if you ate X or Y calories or whether you gain weight or not right now. Overall physical and mental health matter so much and that includes a balanced approach&mindset towards food. ➡️ So challenge those fear foods and don't let guilt or worry over food take up any space in your mind. - - - - #vegan #health #healthy #healthyfood #veganblogger #foodblogger #foodfredom #edrecovery #edsoldier #recoverywarriors #realrecovery #healthylifestyle #instagram #workingout #worldwidevegan #exercise #fitness #user_11 #lifestyle #mindfuleating
user_11;user_11116.jpg;"Vanilla chia seed pudding with raspberries and peanutbutter.... had to scrape the PB jar clean to make sure i got the very last bits 😅 Ultimate survival mode... no crumbs left on the plate. - The recommended chiaseed amount is 2tbsp per day and this is a little more than that 🙄 Chiaseeds can still be seen as a sort of ""new food"" and there isn't alot of studies about how much is ""ok"". - Chiaseeds provide alot of fiber which can help keep you full as well as important for digestive health, can lower cholesterol and blood sugars which can be important for your heart health. - However too much fiber can also CAUSE digestive issues and stomach pain. So make sure to soak - or crush the chia seeds and soak them in liquid. As well as consuming some extra liquid before/after eating them as chia seeds soak up liquid and form a gel. - Aside from fiber they are also rich in protein, calcium and omega 3. As chia seeds are insoluble fiber, meaning they form a gel and the nutrition isn't necessarily absorbed crushing the chia seeds can help with the amount of nutrition absorbed. But otherwise chia seed pudding is both tasty, nutritious and when eaten in moderation good for digestion 😊 - BASIC CHIASEED PUDDING RECIPE 2tbsp chia seeds, 150ml liquid, flavour of choice example vanilla, cacao, coffee. Optional, add in some oats and increase the amount of liquid used. Or add in some berries or bananas.

(If i had at home i would have also added the classic swedish lingonberry jam!) - Fake meat can sometimes be a hot debate... many who are against it. But by now you know i am an advocate for them, in moderation anyway. They make plantbased eating easier for many, are a food replacement and alternative as well as quick option to cook and prepare when short on time. If you don't like them or don't want to consume them, that's cool to.... just don't shame others if they do eat them. 🙌🙌 Home cooked from scratch is great, but eating processed foods in moderation can make life easier and just make eating plantbased more practical and that is great to 🙌 - Also you can tell I'm a nutrition student when without thinking my plate basically looks like the ""plate model"" 😅🥦🥦🥗 - I hope you are all doing well and eating delicious food 🧇🥞🥖🍕🌯🍲🥪🍠🍜 - - - #vegan #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #worldwidevegan #food52 #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #healthyfood #lunch #food #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarian #wholefoods #whatthehealth #forksoverknives #kostvetare #tallriksmodellen #foodlover #dinner #vegandinner #nutritionadvice #nutrition #vegannutrition"
user_11;user_11118.jpg;Do you know what day today is.....? Nope not just any Monday, it is #matlådansdag i.e lunchboxday. And it is definitely a day worth celebrating by taking out your mealprepped lunch box from the freezer, defrosting, and enjoying while being happy over the fact that you have saved both time and money for the rest of the week 😅😅🙌 - Despite not having anywhere to go this week i have still mealprepped. Creamy vegetable pasta with vegan chicken and a peanutbutter-sweet potato stew with tofu! ➡️ Recipe for the pasta in my previous post. - Recipe for the sweet potato stew: - Ingredients:  1 medium sweet potatoe 3 cloves garlic 1 small onion 4-5 sundried tomatoes Frozen spinach 1 can(230ml) coconut milk or use oatcream 1/2 block tofu (125g) (optional ) 1/2 cauliflower 2-3 tbsp red curry paste 2tbsp peanut butter Water (if necessary) – or use some crushed tomatoes for extra flavour and curry A few drops lime 1/2 – 1 tbsp corn starch (to thicken the sauce if necessary) Oil Salt and pepper Rice to serve with & extra lime and peanuts for crunch! How to: I peeled and diced the sweet potato and boiled along with the cauliflower until almost soft. (Note – you can most probably cook everything together in the same pot at the same time and not cook the sweet potato seperatly.) - In a pot i fried diced garlic and onion as well as the tofu. I poured in the coconut milk along with the spinch and tofu. And then i added the peanut butter, red curry paste, few drops of lime, salt and pepper as well as the sun dried tomatoes. I let it simmer for a while and then added some cornstarch to make it thicken to the right consistency. - Taste test to see if you like it – add more flavours/seasoning as necessary. Boil some rice to eat along with the stew! Eat and enjoy! - - #vegan #lunch #mealprep #veganstudent #veganmealprep #letscookvegan #meatfreemeals #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #tasty #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #recipe #vegetarianrecipe #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat #food52 #healthyrecipes #goodoldvegan #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday
user_11;user_11119.jpg;"●There are NO foods you need to/should avoid eating... unless due to allergies, illnesses, intolerances or ethical/religious reasons● - I am sure some of you clicked on this picture thinking...""why should i avoid these foods?"".... i have seen plenty of pictures similar to this with ACTUAL reasons as to why you shouldn't eat X or Y. Or why you shouldn't eat after 6 or why you NEED to eat certain foods. And it is spreading FALSE nutrition INFORMATION. - So i am here to remind you to NOT take random nutrition information *as truth* from random instagram accounts. ➡️ of course hopefully you see me as someone credible and reliable when it comes to providing nutrition information (B.sc in health promotion &nutrition). ➡️ But you should always keep in mind that INDIVIDUAL advice/recommendation can vary from GENERAL recommendations. So if you are struggling with diet/health problems seek professional help for individual advice. - But it is also a good time to remind you all that there are some people online currently trying to sell different supplements or are giving WRONG and possibly detrimental nutrition advice to avoid getting COVID-19. - Yes you can support your immune system but you can't boost it. And no natter how much garlic and c vitamin you consume you are NOT immune to GETTING or SPREADING the virus. - Be critical to information 💕 Stat safe.

user_11;user_11120.jpg;In the mood for food..... and today i am recommending - Rice and (curry roasted) chickpea quesadillas or burritos 😍 If you buy the right burrito bread then fill it with rice, roasted chickpeas, tofu scramble, avocado, sour cream and veggies 😍 Or just do like me... add the filling to half a tortilla bread, fold, chop in half and fry until crispy. - Eat and enjoy with some salad on the side and some sour cream or gucamole 😍 - What type of meals have you been eating lately.... have you come up with any weird quarantine food combinations yet? Maybe that will be a future video idea... trying weird food combos and mixes of food from the result of being inside alone too long 😉😉😅🤷‍♀️🤫 ▪︎ - - And reminder... you can still eat all your favourite foods and eat your normal inatke even if you are just inside or on quarantine. The best is to try to keep a regular food schedule but if you end up snacking all day or overeating... it's ok. You're human. Food tastes good, boredom eating is a thing as well as comfort eating. But be kind to yourself, drink water and eat regular meal times.

user_11;user_11121.jpg;Minimize the amount of dishes you need to wash and make everything in one pot/pan 🙌🙌 Well.... almost 1 pan 🙃 ➡️ You could skip the frying process and instead add all the ingredients for the sauce to the pot with boiled pasta. - To make this delicious pasta dish I.... - Parboiled pasta according to instructions. - In a frying pan, with a generous amount of oil, fried 1 diced red onion, 3 crushed garlic cloves and 1/2 package vegan ch*cken (tofu or tempeh works as well). Seasoned with some salt, pepper and parsley. Then i poured in about 500ml oatcream along with 1,5 tbsp vegetable fond. - When the past was parboiled i added it to the frying pan and allowed to simmer until the pasta had absorbed some of sauce and turned creamy. Then it was just to add some more parsley and fresh tomatoes 🙌 - There you have a 20 minute meal which you can throw together :) why not add some frozen spinach or kale to the pasta or swap the began chicken for chickpeas, tofu or tempeh. - You can also choose another cooking cream if that is what you have at home!! - - - #vegan #lunch #whatthehealth #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #healthyfood #plantbasedfood #veganlifestyle #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #vego #veganstudent #veganfoodshare #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vegansnacks #veganskmiddag #vegansklunch #kost #pasta

user_11;user_11123.jpg;"STUDYING/WORKING FROM HOME and not getting it to work? Well i thought I'd share some of my tips - From an early age i had to learn how to study from home and even if it doesn't always work (hey there social media, netflix and candy crush 😅), i have atleast learnt something about how to study from home. - 1. Write a to do list. Prioritize your assignments and workloads. ➡️ You may have that one assignment which is the most ""fun"" to do but isn't due until last... instead work on the assignments/study for the tests that are due first. - 2. One assignment or subject at a time. When you have several assignments due at once (which i often have) it's easy to jump between the assignments. Instead do one at a time. Maybe 2 hours for one subject before you move to the next - or just focus on one assignment per day. - 3. Doing your normal 9-5 job at home isn't realistic. There are far too many distractions and easy that 10 minutes break turns into 2 hours. Instead set yourself mini goals. Put your phone on silent and if possible put your computer on focus mode. REWARD yourself with series/social media/working out AFTER you have finished your assignments. - 4. Get ready. Get dressed. Have snacks prepared. Sit somewhere that will be your place of work. Also if you can - clean your room/apartment the night before. Have your books and assignments ready and open for the next morning. - 5. Don't forget pauses - but don't make them too long. 45 minutes work, 5-10 minute pause (or whatever works for you.) - 6. Going for a walk, stretching or working out can help you focus better. Help get you out of a ""rut""/thought block so if you feel stuck - go for a walk. But have your assignments open and ready for when you come back. - 7. Set yourself a goal for what you plan to get done for the day. Make it realistic goals. - 8. Just start - do something. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part. Even it you only read 2 pages or write 2 sentences, it is better than nothing. - 9. Also why not skype/call a friend who is doing the same assignment. Just because you're at home doesn't mean you can't discuss with others and get ideas and solve problems 🙌 - 10. Snacks. Coffee. Water 🙌😂👌"

user_11;user_11126.jpg;Is fruit the same as eating sugar cubes?.... well if you listen to LCHF gurus then you may just believe that. ▪︎ I am pretty sure all of my followers know by this point that eating fruit is not the same as eating straight up sugar as some people claim. But some may just need this reminder. 🍎🍏🍒🍉🍌🍇🍍🥝🍑 ▪︎ Yes fruit has natural sugar - fructose. No there is nothing bad or wrong with sugar (fructose). It provides energy for your cells. ▪︎ When eating fruit - compared to eating candy or straight up sugar - you also get fibre. Vitamins. Antioxidants. It gives you a feeling of fullness that candy or sugar doesn't. ▪︎ Of course when you make juices, nice cream or fruit puree there is not as much chewing involved (and with juices you often take away the fibre). But there are still more vitamins, minerals and antioxidants than in just candy/sugar. ▪︎ I've always found it a little strange when people want to demonize certain foods - especially when it is the amount of food eaten (over a longer period of time) that can be the problem... not specific foods themselves. But also... those who recommend putting margarine or coconut oil in coffee, eating bacon, cream and egg yolks for breakfast but won't eat fruit.....? Just a little baffling for me. ▪︎ There is a reason for the 5-a-day recommendation (which also includes vegetables) and that is because there is so much evidence showing the importance of getting in your fruit and veg each day. ▪︎ Fruit is a great snack, easy to eat on the go, it's sweet and nutritious. You can of course combine your fruit with other foods such as oats, yoghurt, chia pudding, nut butter or even eat it on cooked meals such as part of different recipes. ▪︎ It should of course be noted... even if fruit is healthy and nutritious you do infact need to eat more than just fruit. Vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes all provide you with other essential nutrients 🙌🙌 ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #nutritionadvice #nutrionist #vegannutrition #veganstudent #wholefoodsplantbased #rawfood #rawtill4 #carbs #plantpowered #plantbaseddinner #plantbased #wfpb #fruit #kostrådgivare #kost #kostvetare #health #healthy #healthyfood #whatveganseat #nutrients #tasty

user_11;user_11128.jpg;"Turning a pantry raid and 5 minute meal into a semi-gourmet 30 minute meal instead 😃😄😅 ▪︎ Chickpea pancakes (or so called Socca). Garlic roasted haricot verts. Mustard-bertroot dressing. Beans and tomatoes. ▪︎ By now i am a master of throw together pantry meals or just making the best of a few scraps 😄😄 when someone else thinks ""there's no food at home"".. i think, ""what can i make from a few tbsp flour, half a carrot, 3 potatoes and a can of beans"" 🤣 If there isn't a cooking show that is based solely on the concept of using leftovers to create a meal... well then i put a patent on this idea right now 😄👌🙌 ▪︎ RECIPES: For the chickpea pancake start off with a 1:1 ratio of flour and water. Add a little more water until it is a pancake like consistency... whisk to get rid of the clumps. Add alot more seasoning than you think is necessary 😂 Fry until golden brown on both sides. Eat directly when warm. ▪︎ For the dressing i just mixed together @oatly creme fraiche, some beetroot juice, some mustard,salt and pepper. ▪︎ For the haricot verts i added frozen haricot verts to a baking pan.

user_11;user_11129.jpg;Stockpiling up food? So... in alot of countries there is a stockpiling of food which may not be necessary in all places. Not at the moment anyway. ▪︎ Also even if there may be some gaping holes in the food stores at the moment... there will be more food imported shortly. Buy what you need... buy food so that you have enough for a week... don't buy for a whole month. It is unfortunately those who have it financially tough or those who are ill or elderly who will be impacted the worst with the shortages in the food stores. This... because they may not be able to afford the food that is left or because they can't do a big grocery shop and all the food is gone when they actually need to buy more food. ▪︎ But with that said: it is infact recommended that everyone has some dried food, canned food, frozen food at home at all times incases of crisis where you can't leave the house for a while or can't buy more food. ▪︎ So having a backup of dried beans, canned and preserved items, lentils, a big bottle of water, frozen veggies, maybe some powdered items or if you can freeze in some prepared meals is a good idea. ▪︎ As well as also having a medicine bag (painkillers, bandages, handwash, antiseptic, scissors etc). Batteries, matches, candle lights and also a little battery driven torch. Having these items in a bag somewhere easy to find is a good preventative measure. This is also recommended for countries/places where there is risk for natural disasters where you may have to flee or have to stay indoors for days/weeks. ▪︎ Some foods to always have at home pictured above: (beans, lentils, grains, nuts, seeds, frozen veggies, frozen fruit or berries, oil, salt, flour, canned tomatoes, canned foods, different frozen meals that can defrost by themselves and still be ok to eat i.e if there is no electricity!). P.s freezing in fruit and different veggies works fine 👌 ▪︎ And also some easy meals you can make and freeze in tomati-vegetable spaghetti, pasta and lentil bolognese, tomato-quinoa stew with bread, tomato soup, chocolate banana bread, carrot -coconut soup & chickpea cookie dough balls!!

However i mostly just mix together a peanut butter sauce that tastes amazing.... and how authentic it is to pad thai sauce i am not sure 😉🤷‍♀️ ▪︎ Isn't it amazing how many different dishes you can make with the ""same"" ingredients? Before going vegan i definitely ate very boring food and not as colourful either. ▪︎ I know many struggle with WHAT to eat as a vegetarian/vegan... but in all honesty there is so much you CAN eat. The majority of meals can be veganized and with a little creativity and seasoning you can make such amazing meals. Because in all honesty all you are doing is taking away the meat - hopefully replacing with another protein source - and instead using non dairy alternatives in the recipes/dishes. ▪︎ Now a days with social media it's not hard to get inspired with new dishes to try and cook.

user_11;user_11134.jpg;"Health is the greatest wealth.... and i think many are realizing this with the continuous news of the coronavirus now declared a pandemic. ▪︎ The important thing is to ALERT, AWARE but NOT PANIC. Panicking... overstocking of items and using facemasks isn't necessary. ▪︎ Of course it is also a problem with those who aren't taking this seriously. Those who say ""ohh it's just like a normal virus I'LL be fine""... and yes, maybe YOU will. But there are risk groups in society who may not be fine if they get the virus. And as i have a chronic lung illness where it already feels like i am breathing through a straw and have a belt around my chest... i could get some serious consequences if i get the virus. Not to mention all the elderly, those with diabetes, those who are going through cancer treatment, have had transplants or low immune system who could suffer serious consequences from the virus. ▪︎ So even if the majority of people will must likely be ok if they get the virus... as long as they are under quarantine 2 weeks to not spread the virus. There are those in society who won't recover as well - or at all. And as the virus continues to spread, there will be less space in hospitals for those who are in serious need of care. ▪︎ We all have responsibility to stay safe, wash our hands THOROUGHLY (20 seconds with soap before rinsing with water!). If you are sick - STAY AT HOME. I know this may be tough, we all have bills to pay and obligatory work or school assignments. But if you have a fever or feeling very sick, better to stay home and rest a few days. And even if you might feel *ok* if you do have a virus you may spread it to others who won't recover as quickly or easily.... there is a reason for the quarantine. ▪︎ Stock up on basics... but don't panic about it. ▪︎ And of course... no garlic, turmeric and chilli won't prevent you getting sick and won't cure. Neither will saunas or hot water as some people claim. Sure, elderberry, echinacea, ashwaganda may help SUPPORT your immune system but no... it won't cure you from a virus or protect you from getting sick. Neither will antibiotics unless it is a bacterial infection. ▪︎ Stay safe. Take care of your health💕"
user_11;user_11135.jpg;A warm comforting bowl of cinnamon oats with raisins, banana and peanut butter 😍 An amazing start to the day. ▪︎ Do you count calories or macros? ▪︎ I used to.... food was numbers. High calories meant bad, unhealthy and i wouldn't eat it. But the fact is... high calorie foods or meals doesn't have to be bad or unhealthy. It's about perspective and overall intake. Not one or two meals or foods. ▪︎ Calories and numbers shouldn't rule your food choices. However as a health coach and nutritonist, having some knowledge of calories or energy intake in general doesn't have to be a bad thing. ▪︎ The more knowledge you get about calories and nutrients the easier it is to put everything into perspective. I often notice that when you only know little about nutrition or calories it is harder to put it into perspective. ▪︎ Calories matter and have an importance but there are also other factors that matter. Such as food quality, nutrition, if you like the food you eat, that you can digest the food (i.e don't feel sick/get pain after eating the food) and even that it makes you happy, is part of being social. ▪︎ Some knowledgeable of nutrition and calories is important... if anything, just to take away the fear of calories because that is one of the big problems the FEAR of calories. When calories is just energy... and we all need energy and calories daily. But we all have different requirements of how much energy we need. ▪︎ I don't talk about calories and don't share the nutritional info of my meals or recipes as it can be very triggering. But it also important to not be scared of calories and not let them impact your food choices too much..... if this makes sense. ▪︎ FOOD IS MORE THAN NUMBERS. Knowledge is good... obsessiveness is NOT 🙌 And final note... leave the calorie counting to dietitians and nutritionists.

user_11;user_11136.jpg;RAISIN OR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES? ▪︎ I know some people say that raisin cookies are the reason they have trust issues (i.e expected and wanted chocolate chip 🙈). But i am a HUGE lover of oatmeal raisin cookies. ▪︎ So chickpea cookie dough is a thing... so i thought... why not make oatmeal raisin chickpea cookie dough a thing and it is AMAZING. THE BEST THING I HAVE EATEN IN A WHILE(why am i screaming?) ▪︎ RECIPE: 1 can (225g) or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas c.a 45g nut butter (any nut or seed butter will work) 90g rolled oats Stevia 3/4 cup raisins 2tbsp syrup (or dates should work) 1 tsp vanilla extract, optional Cinnamon, cardamom, salt Coconut shreds ▪︎ INSTRUCTIONS In a mixer/food processor add the chickpeas. Then, add your oats and peanut butter as well as stevia, syrup, cinnamon, salt, cardamom and mix. ▪︎ Finally fold in the raisins with a spoon and you’re done! Optional add some coconut shreds! Eat as it is or roll into balls. (You could even try baking them as cookies!) ▪︎ Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days. ▪︎ #vegan #snacks #vegansnack #bestofvegan #thefeedfeedvegan #user_11 #lifestyle #eatsbyizzy #wholefoodsplantbased #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #valjvego #user_11 #vegetarianrecipe #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #food52 #goodoldvegan #food #tasty #tastyfood #veganstudent #veganfoodshare

user_11;user_11139.jpg;Boring mealpreps....? Nope, don't know her 😅😅 ▪︎ Make mealprepping fun... make it deliciois.... make it creative and not just a chore that has to be done. ▪︎ Instead... see it as investment into your future and health. Having your meals prepared so you don't need to stress about cooking each day. Or you don't need to spend a bunch of money on food out (unless you happen to *accidently* leave your mealprepped lunch at home 😅😉😉). But also making sure you get the right energy and nutrients you need.... whether that's a pasta salad or pasta IN salad lunch box,everyone has different requirements. ▪︎ Of course if you are someone who doesn't want to eat the same meal the whole week.... meal prep 2-3 different dishes (atleast 1 of the recipes you should be able to freeze in!). Or mealprep different ingredients which you can them whip together into different combos throughout the week! 🙂 ▪︎ ORRR.... mealprep could just be making a huge dinner and have leftovers for lunch the next day or two 🙌 ▪︎ So... what's not to love about mealprep.... well aside from the fact that avocado, roast potatoes, tomatoes and fresh spinach don't freeze or reheat well 😅😅 ▪︎ Red lentil-veggie lasagne and green pea pesto avocado as my werkend mealprep 😂 Doing next weeks meals tomorrow. ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #mealprep #meatlessmonday #veganmealprep #whatveganseat #veganskmat #veganskmiddag #vegansklunch #veganfood #sundaymealprep #mondaymealprep #wholefoodsplantbased #whatthehealth #whatveganseat #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #food #instafood #realrecovery #eatsbyizzy #lunch #vegetarianrecipe #veganstudent
user_11;user_11140.jpg;"Happy international women's day 🙌 ▪︎ We shouldn't really ""need"" a day to celebrate women.... but then again this day is also about acknowledging the inequality that is between men and women in society. But also acknowledging the other inequalities in society such as discrimination that happens based on race, sex etc ▪︎ As women... we want equality in society. To have the same salary as males, to have the same opportunity as males, to not have a ""glass ceiling"" when trying to climb in your career and job position.

Believe that you can.... something i have noticed is that it mostly women who hold themselves back when it comes to opportunities and careers.. believing they don't have the capabilities or knowledge... so why even try. But you know what... Start your business. Send in your resume. Apply for that job. You have nothing to lose. ▪︎ Also.... don't tear down other women in your journey to the top. Be inspired by other females winning and succeeding... you don't have to get jealous or hate, instead get motivated and inspired. Be happy for your female friends who are succeeding and reaching their goals. ▪︎ And also remember..you don't have to look a certain way.

Add taco seasoning.. or go for garlic, onion and basilica for a more traditional taste. ▪︎ After 5 minutes Add c.a 200g red lentils. 500ml crushed tomatoes. 200-300ml water. Allow to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. ▪︎ Add the black beans after anout 12 minutes.Note you can add other veggies or beans as well! Season with salt and pepper.

user_11;user_11143.jpg;I don't know about you.... but i am very much ready for Friday and the weekend 😁 And that may just include pizza for many 🍕 ▪︎ Alot of people struggle to give up cheese when going vegan.... there is no vegan cheese that will taste completely like the dairy cheese. But there are so many different brands of non dairy cheeses on the market so there may be some trial and error to find the one you like. But don't give up just because you didn't like it the first time. Many restaurants are now using plantbased cheeses on pizza so that you don't just need to eat pizza crust with tomato sauce and veggies. ▪︎ Also you can slowly decrease your intake of cheese if you want to eat more plantbased.... go from eating it daily to just a few times a week to just once a week. That still makes a difference 🙌 Even if it takes you a while to give it up... or it's the one animal product you can't give up it still makes a difference 🖐 ▪︎ Just don't forget to get your calcium from other sources such as tofu, means, fortified plantbased milks and cereals, nuts, dark leafy greens 🙌 ▪︎ I've never actually been a fan of melted cheese.... or pizza in general. I'd personally choose burgers or tacos over pizza 😅 but from time to time i can enjoy it! ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #pizza #food #weekend #fryday #veganpizza #instafood #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tastyfood #plantpowered #veganstudent #veganuary2020 #whatthehealth #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #veganskmiddag #vegansklunch #veagnerisverige #thefeedfeedvegan #bestofvegan #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vegetarianrecipe
user_11;user_11144.jpg;Getting in those greens..... Peas, spinach, avocado 😍🥑🥦🥗 ▪︎ Making a green pea pesto/guacamole is a great alternative to regular pesto or guacamole. Not to mention here in Sweden i choose the Swedish green peas, so environmentally friendly as well as being cheap and nutritious! ▪︎ Choosing a bean pasta or wholegrain pasta to add even more fibre, protein and iron to your meal... and why not add some pumpkin seeds on top which are rich in iron, or choose some other seeds or nuts for healthy fats. ▪︎ There are many ways you can make this sauce - i usually just make it with green peas, spinach, 1 avocado, garlic cloves, salt & pepper and some oil or water to thin it out. Mix it all together in a food processor 🙂 ▪︎ But you could add in some cashews which have soaked for a few hours or add some white beans or tofu to the sauce 🥦🥦🥗 ▪︎ Definitely an easy and delicious meal to make :) And of course, works great for mealprep. And also works fine to freeze in the sauce (which i am going to do as i made so much of it!). ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #veganism #veganfood #pasta #vegetables #green #greenfood #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #recipecreator #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #whatveganseat #goodoldvegan #foodblogger #healthyfood #instafood #tasty #budgetfood #environmentallyfriendly #plantbaseddinner #wfpb #vegetarisk #vegetariskmat

user_11;user_11149.jpg;ONE POT PASTA. The ultimate mealprep recipe... the ultimate quick meal... the ultimate cheap(?) meal 😍 LOOOKKK how creamy this turned out. ▪︎ How you make one pot pasta can vary alot.... what pasta you use (or if you use spaghetti!). What veggies you add. What type of sauce you want.... ▪︎ This recipe isn't really a recipe either as i didn't measure anything. Infact you don't have to.... freestyling works great! Sometimes you just need meal inspiration and not exact recipes. ▪︎ Pasta Oat cooking cream (or use soy cooking cream) Bbq sauce Spinach or kale Vegan chicken pieces (or tofu) Sundried tomatoes Vegan greek cheese Salt and pepper ▪︎ How to: Boil pasta of choice - and amount you want according to instructions. Once the pasta is aldente i.e after about 5-6 minutes of boiling. Pour away some of the water, keeping just a little in the bottom. ▪︎ Pour in the cooking cream - adding more as necessary. Add in the BBQ sauce along with spinach, vegan chicken pieces and sundried tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. ▪︎ Allow to simmer for 5-6 minutes, stirring when necessary and adding more cooking cream if needed. ▪︎ The sauce should thicken and become creamy - if it really doesn't thicken i.e maybe too much water or you used a light cooking cream. Then add a little corn starch to the pasta and stir in. ▪︎ Once thicken and the right creaminess, add in the vegan greek cheese and serve with some extra spinach. ▪︎ Eat and enjoy 🙂🙂 ▪︎ If you try this... don't forget to let me know.

user_11;user_11150.jpg;TACO FRIDAY 🌮🌮😍 Soooo i started off with the plan to make tacos.... ▪︎ Roasted sweet potato, bbq cauliflower and paprika roasted chickpeas. Added in some veggies, black beans, feta cheese (vegan), sweet corn and pickled onion...... BUT i overfilled the tacos so much. It was impossible to eat..... also adding black beans to the bottom of the bread made it soggy. ▪︎ Soo. Change of plans. Place the taco filling in a bowl. Chop the tortilla bread into small nacho pieces. Place on a baking sheet... drizzle with a little oil and salt. Bake in the oven around 5 minutes, then turn the chips over and bake for another 5-6 minutesat 175C. ▪︎ And then... eat a taco bowl with homemade nacho chips! Works just as well 😍 ▪︎ Also, i could have made a nacho plate where i add the nachos to a baking pan... add all the toppings (aside from veggies) on top. Grate some cheese ontop and then into the oven for 5-8 minutes... the top with the veggies, eat and enjoy. ▪︎ Sometimes you just need a change of plans when cooking 🌮🌮😂 ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #thefeedfeedvegan #healthylifestyle #foodblogger #tacos #fryday #tacofredag #recipe #veganrecipes #vegansofig #whatveganseat #wholefoods #tasty #tastyfood #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #buzzfeedtasty #bonappetit #f52grams #vegetarianrecipe #meatfreemeals
user_11;user_11151.jpg;Fresh vs frozen vegetables..... which is the best? Which would YOU choose? ▪︎ Unfortunately frozen vegetables get a rather bad rep.... mostly because they're seen as processed and therefore not as good. But you know what... the processing part, i.e the freezing of the vegetables can help preserve nutrients in the vegetables. As well as minimizing food waste. ▪︎ For many fresh vegetables there is quite a long time from when the vegetables are picked/scorded to when they arrive to the store... and then it's the transport from the store to your house and maybe a few more days until you actually eat and/or cook the vegetables. And all that time, some nutrients can leach out. Not to mention the huge amount of food waste due to the food maybe going bad, getting damaged or dropped etc ▪︎ Frozen vegetables are often cheaper as well which is positive. And lasts long. ▪︎ However taste wise the fresh vs frozen can differ... example fresh kale is crispy and crunchy where frozen is not. Frozen diced onion does not have as much flavour as the fresh onion. Frozen broccoli does not have the same texture as fresh. So taste and texture wise go for the one you enjoy the most. ▪︎ Freezing vegetables doesn't lower the nutrient value. Of course all foods when cooked and prepared there will be a leaching of vitamins... where boiling vegetables will have the most impact. Whereas steaming, quick microwaving or sauteing will have the least impact on nutrient content. ▪︎ OF COURSE the different in nutrient content really isn't something you should think or worry about... especially considering that you most likely eat several meals a day, different vegetables, grains etc. But also that losing some nutrients when preparing food is inevitable.... maybe you just want to think about not using too much liquid when boiling vegetables and use just enough to cover the veggies. ▪︎ What about raw veggies...? Some veggies are most nutritious when raw.. while others are best when cooked and preferably eaten with some healthy fats for the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins. ▪︎ At the end of the day... choosing the type of vegetable you enjoy the most and ACTUALLY eat is the best option. 👌
user_11;user_11152.jpg;As you know... my approach to food, nutrition and health isn't about taking away food or creating restrictions... instead focus on what you can add into your diet and life to create healthier habits and lifestyle. ▪︎ Example instead of taking away your favourite foods... see if you can add some foods such as fruit, veggies, wholegrains, legumes, grains as well. Or doing a 50/50 approach such as 50% meat/50% beans in a bolognese, or 50% white bread and 50% wholegrain bread. ▪︎ An overall balanced approach is key and focus on creating a healthy lifestyle not restrictions 👌 ▪︎ Puff pastry with vegan cream cheese, garlic fried aubergine, bell pepper and onion with kale which i filled the puff pastry with and into the oven. Finally adding some vegan feta cheese (not sponsored 😅). This was so yummy and works as a great snack.... the crumbly, flaky goodness with the melty-creamy cheese and the slight garlicky crunch from the veggies. ▪︎ This is definitely a snack i need to remake 🙌 ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #appetizer #veganfood #vegetarianrecipe #snack #snacks #veganstudent #cheapvegan #cheapfood #food #tasty #healthycooking #healthyeats #whatthehealth #whatveganseat #lunch #dinner #food #instafood #thefeedfeedvegan #brunch #meatlessmonday #meatfreemeals #eatsbyizzy

user_11;user_11154.jpg;Sometimes the only veggies you get are the basil on your pizza and tomato sauce under the cheese 😉😉😆 Otherdays it's green juices, green salad bowls and veggie filled summer rolls for dinner. ▪︎ Even if what you eat, how much you eat of something in the long term matters... so does the intention and reason as to WHY you eat something. ▪︎ As a nutritionist or someone working with health you can't set aside that nutrition and energy intake matters for health. HOWEVER you also need a holistic approach meaning that it's not just food, calories or macros that affect your health. There are plenty of other factors that play a roll. ▪︎ Yes nutritionally or based on numbers a green salad may be healthier than a pizza. But that is just based on calorie comparison and not based on individuals health or requirements. There are general recommendations and then there are INDIVIDUAL HEALTH recommendations which matter more. ▪︎ Craving that pizza.... go for it. Just think about not buying a storebought pizza everyday and even if you do...? Well the try eating a salad on the side or getting in some fruit, veggies and homecooked meals for your other meals. ▪︎ It doesn't have to be either or 👌👌🙌 ORR... if you are a true pizza lover and want it daily... why not try make your own? Add lots of veggies on top and try different pizza base crusts 👌 Then you get a little variation anyway. ▪︎ The cheese topping is made from grated @violife_foods and creme fraiche from @oatly mixed together 😊 ▪︎ #pizza #pizzaparty #nedaawarenessweek #foodforthought #foodfreedom #vegan #whatveganseat #thefeedfeedvegan #wholefoodsplantbased #vegetarianrecipe #veganfoodvideo #veganfood #eatsbyizzy #eatvegan #meatfree #meatfreemeals #user_11 #realrecovery #recoverywarriors #plantbaseddinner #food #instafood
user_11;user_11155.jpg;As it's national eating disorder awareness week... let me just remind you that no food will ever harm you as much as your eating disorder will. ▪︎ All those food rules. All the anxiety. All the stress.... that will harm you so much more than just eating the food you are so scared of eating. ▪︎ I know it's scary... i know it's tough to break food rules. I know its scary to face fear foods... but it is so worth it in the long run. ▪︎ Because when you're older... what are you going to remember? The times you skipped out on social events because of the fear of eating? The trips you said no to due to anxiety and not having control? The regret of not going for what you want in life because your eating disorder held you back....? Regret on how much you missed out on because you wanted to weigh X kilo or you had to workout. ▪︎ What you are going to remember - or want to remember... is the good times. The happy moments in life. The experiences, memories and opportunities. Not whether you ate 3 or 4 slices of pizza or ate x or y calories one day. ▪︎ This years theme is #comeasyouare ... looking back on how far you have come. Reflecting on positive steps you've taken or on setbacks and how you can overcome them... ▪︎ I encourage you all to really set the goal to challenge yourself to overcome your eating disorder... disordered eating or just food rules in general. Remind yourself that recovery is possible and so worth it. ▪︎ All the small steps and fears your face... they add up. ▪︎ Think... in 1 years time your life could be completely different, but then you also have to make the changes to achieve that! ▪︎ Always reach out if you need help 💕 You are not alone and you can recover and find food balance even if it does take hard work, facing fears, ups and downs... 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. It's a journey and process! ▪︎ ▪︎ #neda #nedawareness #nedaawarenessweek #neda2020 #health #healthy #foodforthought #foodfredom #healthpromotion #realtalk #realrecovery #foodforlife #nutritionadvice #intuitiveeating #mindfuleating #vegan #veganstudent #veganskmat #whatbrokeveganseat #pizza #pizzalover

(I'll also share the recipe for chocolate-coffee-coconut snack balls i made this weekend!) ▪︎ RECIPE: 250g cashews @gebana.official 230g mango @gebanasverige 40g rolled oats 30g shredded coconut & more to coat in 0,5g saffron 1/2 lime 1 tsp coconut oil Ginger Vanilla Pinch of salt ▪︎ (NOTE THESE WORK FINE TO FREESTYLE. YOU DON'T NEED EXACT MEASUREMENTS!) ▪︎ Soak mango in warm water for a few minutes until soft.(not mushy!). Add all the ingredients into a food mixer. Once combined and a dough like texture. Roll into balls and coat in coconut shreds. Place in the fridge and then ready to eat when you need 1 or 5 😊😊 ▪︎ These type of balls/bars are a great weekday alternative to sweets or candy, or a good alternative for children as a sweet snack. Not to mention if you use walnuts you will also get a source of omega 3... And the nuts provide both protein and iron, and the c vitamin from mango will help the absorption of the iron 👌👌 ▪︎ Do you have a favourite school or work snack to bring with you? 😍😍 ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #snack #snacks #veganstudent #icastudent #tidningenbuffe #cheapvegan #vegansnack #rawfood #vegannutrition #nutritionadvice #healthyfood #healthysnacks #snacking #veganfoodshare #veganuary2020 #worldwidevegan #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #tastyfood #plantpowered #healthy #food #eatvegan #dairyfree #instafood #valjvego #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #veganrecipes
user_11;user_11157.jpg;"So this mealprep was the result of having absolutely no idea what to cook or make.... let me take you along my track of thoughts when cooking. ▪︎ Okk... so what do i have in my fridge and pantry? Root vegetables... avocado... i have rice and quinoa in the freezer....🤔 ▪︎ Ok I'll roast some vegetables. Maybe make a sticky sesame chickpea dish with rice and broccoli and some roast vegetables with quinoa. ▪︎ Realise I'm missing quite a few ingredients to make the chickpea dish. Consider going to the store... but really don't feel like doing that. ""Ok.. so I'll try to just do my best with what i have at home"". ▪︎ Roast the vegetables... defrost the quinoa and think... why not make a vegetable-quino bake... throw the half roasted veggies and quinia and tomato sauce into a form... add spices and back into the oven. ▪︎ The rice situation... thought about making rice and carrot burgers... but didn't really feel like it and i always fail with vegetable burgers. Then i thought... why not just make fried rice... so began doing that. Then i found saffron as well as peas and mushrooms in the freezer... why not make some type of paella? ▪︎ And that is how i ended up with this mealprep 😂 In all honesty i should have filmed it... showing you how to use up a bunch of leftovers. And now i have food for the week. ▪︎ I will be adding some tofu to these meals just to make them more balanced and nutritious because just rice and veggies or quinoa and root vegetables isn't really enough or a balanced meal according to me. ▪︎ Mealprep isn't always planned... sometimes you just have to use what you have at home and make the best of it 🙌🙌😉🥑 ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #veganstudent #mealprep #mealprepbyizzy #meatlessmonday #veganmealprep #cheapvegan #cheapveganfood #eatsbyizzy #thefeedfeedvegan #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #veganfood #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #plantpowered #wholefoodsplantbased #vegetarianrecipes #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #food #instafood #avocado"

user_11;user_11159.jpg;"Anyone else remember when #sushisunday was a huge thing on Instagram... or is that just me? Also... anyone ever think about all the people you used to follow on social media but they stopped using their social media.... and now you wonder how they're doing and what they're doing? Or is that just me.... ▪︎ Making homemade sushi is really easy... i also use ""grötris"" which is basically the same as sushi rice but cheaper! Boil according to instructions and then pour in a mix of ricevinegar, sugar and salt. It never turns out exactly as sushi rice from restaurants but it still tastes good. ▪︎ I chill the rice for several hours or over night. Then it's just to compose rhe sushi, add your fillings, roll into rolls,place in the fridge and then cut into sushi pieces 😍 🍣🍣🍙 ▪︎ My go to filling is usually avocado and tofu... but all i had was avocado so that was what i used 🙌👏 All in all i got 3 rolls for very cheap. ▪︎ Also...

user_11;user_11160.jpg;"Anyone else long for weekend breakfasts? Of course.. i don't have a 9-5 job so i can have a luxury late breakfast skme weekdays... if anything it is the weeekends i have to get up early and rush out the door for work. ▪︎ But if you're like me a prefer a later breakfast and are more of a savoury person... then toast some bagels and make a chickpea ""tuna"" salad. Perfect in bread, baked potatoes, in salad or just eat on it's own like i did 😅 ▪︎ RECIPE: 1 1/2 tetrapack of chickpeas (around 300g) 5tbsp vegan mayonnaise/cremefraiche/greek yoghurt 1-2tbsp relish - or capers 2-3tbsp celery or sweet corn (adds crunch!) Salt and pepper 1tbsp lemon juice Optional: Dill, avocado, red onion (diced) ▪︎ This recipe can vary alot depending on what ingredients you want to add and also seasoning can vary. So the best is to EXPERIMENT. Use this as a base recipe and vary it depending on what you like :) ▪︎ How to: Mash the chickpeas with a fork. Add in the relish/capers (or both), celery/sweet corn. Drizzle over the lemon juice along with salt and pepper. Add the creme fraiche/mayonnaise and mix until combined.

user_11;user_11161.jpg;Back to the buddha bowls.... (this was eaten last week 👌😉) Roasted eggplant, boiled sweet potato, kale, roasted chickpeas and cashew dressing. ▪︎ Let's talk health and micromanaging your food intake. ▪︎ Many think of health as eating Xg carbs, Xg protein, 2l water per day etc etc and sure... certain people in certain situations or with certain illnesses may need to micromanage their food in that way. Example if you have diabetes you may need to be aware of how many carbs you eat, or if you need to eat a low or high protein diet you may need to be aware of how little or much protein you eat. ▪︎ But for the general population micromanaging food intake is not necessary. Instead focus on the overall picture..... Colourful meals. Varied meals throughout the week i.e eating the same dish for lunch and dinner all week is not the most varied. But if that's what you have to do for time/money, then you can atleast vary with another dish the following week. ▪︎ Try to get 4-5 fruits/veggies per day. Drink a few glasses of water.... it doesn't have to be exact grams or amounts. ▪︎ Your body is not a calculator.... just because something says its 500kcal doesn't mean it is... it could be 480kcal or 520kcal. And you don't necessarily absorb all the energy anyway so focusing solely on calories isn't accurate. And if health is your goal then calorie focus definitely shouldn't be your go to. ▪︎ Remember health is about more then numbers and specific grams or calories. Your mental health, physical health, social health(?) All matter as well. Focus on the bigger picture rather than small details. Also health is long term... you may go through periods where you barely eat any vegetables or workout but in the long term you do eat varied, get your veggies in and workout and that matters more. ▪︎ My suggestion: Focus on what you do (in general) on a monthly basis.... not what you do from day to day. I.e you just eat salad and run 6 days a week for 1 week out of the month and the other 3 weeks you don't workout and live off of pizza.... it would be much better if you instead aimed to workout 2-3 times a week and only ate pizza 1-2 times per week for the whole month 🙌🙌
user_11;user_11162.jpg;Tofu vs tempeh... which do you prefer? ▪︎ Personally I'm all for tofu!!! Even if i have begun to like tempeh... the whole fermented soybean thing still freaks me out. Not to mention a good marinade is KEY to making tempeh tasty. ▪︎ Tempeh and tofu are very similar in nutrition.... temoeh is made from fermented soybeans or can be made from other beans or peas. While tofu is made from coagulated soymilk and can be found in different firmness/texture. ▪︎ Tempeh and tofu products can have different nutrition amounts based on which soybeans are used, how much water is used etc so the nutrition is based on one brand i found/use. ▪︎ Tofu is your go to for calcium... especially if you use tofu that is enriched with calcium. While tempeh is your go to for iron and fibre. Tempeh also has less phytates (and therefore easier to digest) as it is fermented as well as providing prebiotics due to the fermentation. ▪︎ As tempeh can be made from peas or other beans it is also suitable for those with soya allergy. ▪︎ Both tempeh and tofu are low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. However buying premarinated versions will increase the sodium and fat. ▪︎ Tofu can be prepared in so many ways... but the best is to buy a firm kind and to press it of water before marinating and then frying,baking,adding to woks, soups, pasta dishes etc. Or buy a silktofu to make different desserts or just to inrich your smoothies with protein. ▪︎ Tempeh... marinate and then bake or fry 🙌👌 ▪︎ ▪︎ #nutrition #nutritionadvice #worldwidevegan #vegannutrition #user_11 #kost #kostvetare #hälsosamlivsstil #hälsokost #health #healthandwellness #healthpromotion #nutrionist #kostvetare #protein #tofu #veganstudent #eatvegan #vegetarianrecipe #meatlessmonday #meatfree #healthyfood #healthcoach #realrecovery #food

user_11;user_11164.jpg;Anyone else love colourful bowls as much as me? ▪︎ This of course hasn't always been the case.... there was a time where bread and butter, cereal and milk and chicken nuggets and ketchup was my go to (even if i am thankful that i ate vegetarian meals growing up). And then of course it was the phase (years) where i only wanted to eat vegetables and would panic if there wasn't vegetables on my plate.... i felt like the meal was uncomplete and not as healthy if it didn't contain vegetables ▪︎ Now I'm in the middle stage... i love eating vegetables, preferably lots of them and colourful meals. But i don't panic or freak out if my meal just consists of fries and ketchup or pasta and pesto.... Balance is key 🥦🥦😉 ▪︎ Here you see my meal from the weekend: quinoa with roasted vegetables and a cashew dressing. As simple as that and even if it may look dry... it wasn't. But you can of course add some hummus, pesto, garlic tahini dressing or vegan creme fraiche if you want more sauce 🥑 ▪︎ I hope your Monday has been good and you're ready for the week.... got your meals prepped or planned for the week? ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #plantpowered #plantbaseddinner #thefeedfeedvegan #thevegansclub #healthyfood #worldwidevegan #food52 #tastyfood #vegetarianfood #vegetarianrecipe #nutritionadvice #vegannutrition #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #valjvego #mealprep #mealprepbyizzy #letscookvegan #icabuffet
user_11;user_11165.jpg;This weeks mealprep! Creamy spaghetti with mushrooms and vegan sausages. ▪︎ Tastes just as good cold as it does warm!! Infact spaghetti or pasta are one of the best mealprep foods according to me as it works so well to be frozen and reheated! ▪︎ RECIPE (made 3 mealboxes) ▪︎ However much spaghetti you want (i used about 250g maybe). 1 small red onion, diced 2 garlic cloves, sliced thinly A few handfuls of mushroom 150g vegan sausage, chopped 1 tbsp vegetable fond Salt and pepper 250ml oat cream Parsley Spinach ▪︎ Boil pasta according to instructions. ▪︎ In a frying pan, fry the onion (diced), garlic, mushroom slices and sausage slices in some oil. Allow to turn golden brown, roughly 5 minutes. ▪︎ Pour in the oatcream along with the vegetable fond, salt and black pepper. And lower heat to simmer. ▪︎ Once the spaghetti is cooked, add to the frying pan along with 2-3tbsp of the water it boiled in. Mix the pasta into the sauce and heat for 5 minutes until combined. Add the spinach and parsley and season with more salt or pepper as desired. ▪︎ As simple as that... and you can of course skip the mushrooms or use something else instead of the sausages 😊😊🙌👌 ▪︎ If you give this dish a try don't forget to let me know and tag me/message me!!! ▪︎ All about that weekend mealprep am i right? 👌👌🙌 ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #mealprep #veganmealprep #letscookvegan #mealprepbyizzy #mealprepsunday #meatlessmonday #meatfree #thefeedfeedvegan #cheapvegan #cheapveganfood #veganstudent #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #pasta #food #tastyfood #instafood #tasty #vegetarianfood #veganrecipes #vegetarianrecipe #thefeedfeed

user_11;user_11167.jpg;One pan meals...time efficient, easy to make, cheap and nutritious!!. ▪︎ So fibre... Fibre has so many benefits. ▪︎ Helps keep you full, helps with digestion and bowel movements. Can help lower cholesterol as well as impact bloodsugar. It can help with weight maintenance as well as important for your gut bacteria!! ▪︎ Not to mention the foods with fibre also provide you with complex carbs, antioxidants, wholegrains, b vitamins, folate, iron and also protein! ▪︎ The fibre recommendation is 25-35g per day and many don't reach that amount while many vegans can eat double of triple that. ▪︎ Fibre is important and has many health benefits but more isn't always better.... ▪︎ Tomorrow (hopefully) I'll post a video on my YouTube when i try a low fibre diet.. so stay tuned for that.

user_11;user_11168.jpg;My ❤ for the day 🙌🙌 In all honesty nothing beats the love you get from your pets🙌 If it wasn't that my dog was 12 years old i would definitely want to move her so she could live with me.... but of course that would just be a selfish act as the best for her is to live with my parents. ▪︎ Are you more of a cat or dog person.... or maybe a horse, hamster, bunny person? ▪︎ There is of course alot of debate where having pets is vegan or not and that is not a debate i plan to get into. However i do believe you should #adoptnotshop and that animals you adopt become a part of your family. You need to have the time, money and understanding for the animal you adopt. Not just get one on a whim only to have to give it away a year later because it took more time or money than you thought. ▪︎ But pets bring so much joy and happiness, not mention my dog has been a huge part of my past recovery from eating disorders and depression. Anxiety help pets and animals for mental health do work! ▪︎ This is my 2 cents on the subject anyway... ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #veganism #realrecovery #recoverywarriors #plantbased #user_11 #valentinesday #selfcare #mentalhealth #selflove #beagle #beaglesofinstagram #health #healthy #vegetarian
user_11;user_11169.jpg;Happy Valentines day 😊🙌 So first off... i apologize for being such an instagram foodie and falling for the pressure of making heart food 😂 I had to do it! #noshame ▪︎ So... valentines day... All about love and that should also include self love/self care. ▪︎ Be kind to yourself today.... Make yourself your favourite meal... eat your favourite dessert. Do something you love today.... Put on a face mask, wash your hair,take a long bath... pamper yourself... or why not book in a massage/spaday/get your hair or nails done? Buy yourself roses and chocolate 😉 Meet your friends and have dinner or just do something fun together! ▪︎ I'm not a huge fan of valentine's day - relationship or not -it just feels overly commercialised. And instead i see it as a self care and self love day 🙌 And that means heart shaped pancakes with chocolate chips. ▪︎ Also... self love - saying nice things about myself and not letting that inner critic bring me down. ▪︎ So.... what are your plans today or what will you do for yourself in the name of self care and self love? ▪︎ ▪︎ ▪︎ #valentinesday #selfcare #selflove #food #veganfood #vegetarianfood #thefeedfeedvegan #thefeedfeed #wholefoodsplantbased #wfpb #dessert #vegandessert #bestofvegan #valjvego #tastyfood #healthyfood #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #f52grams #studenteats #cheapvegan #meatlessmonday #instafood #buzzfeedtasty #plantpowered #user_11 #foodfredom
user_11;user_11170.jpg;DINNER IDEA: Roasted eggplant with a balsamic glaze, filled with quinoa, onion, tomatoes, vegan feta, parsley and a tahini dressing and some cashews. ▪︎ CAN I GET A YUMMM😍😍🙌 ▪︎ How to: Rinse and half the eggplant. Cut crisscross into each eggplant half. Mix together the balsamic glaze (c.a 3tbsp oil, 1tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp syrup, crushed garlic, salt and pepper.) Coat the eggplant in the glaze and let sit for 30 minutes. Then roast in the oven at 180C for ~35-40 minutes. ▪︎ In the mean time... boil quinoa with water and a vegetable stock. Fry red onion along with cocktail tomatoes in some oil. Once the quinoa is done... mix together with the onion, tomatoes, feta cheese, parsley. ▪︎ Once the eggplants are done... either fill the eggplants with the quinoa mix and bake for another 5-10 minutes( this works better though if you're using a lentil filling and other cheese type)... or just fill with the quinoa mix and top with some tahini, eat and enjoy!! ▪︎ Easy... delicious... nutritious 🙌🙌 ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #veganrecipes #bestofvegan #thefeedfeedvegan #theveganvibe #wholefoodsplantbased #icastudent #user_11 #eatsbyizzy @bestofvegan @thefeedfeed.vegan @goodoldvegan @thevegansclubbowls #healthyfood #tastyfood #food #instafood #vegetarianfood #vegetarianrecipes #recipe #wfpb #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #whatveganseat #plantpowered

user_11;user_11172.jpg;Let's talk carbohydrates.... Lot's of people cut out carbs in the hopes of losing weight... getting fit... eating clean? ▪︎ Many proclaim carbohydrates are the worst and eating white rice, pasta, bread or noodles will make you sick and gain weight 🙃🙃 And lots of people eating cauliflower rice and zucchini noodles saying it tastes just like the real thing.... no it doesn't. Just like vegan cheese doesn't taste like dairy cheese... #letsbehonesthere ▪︎ I am not going to shame anyone for their food choices.. I've eaten 0 calorie noodles, 0 calorie sauce and added zucchini to my oats and called it #healthandwellness . I was naive. ▪︎ Carbs aren't bad or unhealthy. When you cut out carbs... yes you can lose water weight. Yes, you decrease your calorie intake. Yes you may feel tired and not get enough fibre. You even miss out on nutrients and vitamins if you completely cut out carbohydrates. ▪︎ Personally i will always promote choosing wholegrain alternatives as they provide more nutrients... but if you don't want to (or can't) switch to whole grain alternatives... you can do 50/50 ex. Noodles and zoodles, rice and cauliflower rice, meat and beans.... or think about what you add. ▪︎ Example what sauce do you add to the pasta and can you add some veggies? Can you choose a nutritious topping on the white bread (avocado😉 hummus? Lentil spread?)? Etc ▪︎ Carbohydrates provide you with energy, fibre and fill you up. Even if weightloss is the goal... that doesn't mean you have to just eat salad or vegetables. You can still eat carbohydrates. • Also let's not forget... eating a huge salad or bowl of zoodles with tomato sauce may fill you up... but it may not leave you satisfied or provide you the nutrients you need. ▪︎ Final note... if you love zoodles why not do a 50/50 mix? Or add in some roast root vegetables ...... or some wholegrain bread on the side 🙌🙌😉🥯 ▪︎ Carbs aren't evil... as some people online may make you believe!! If you like raw food salads... eat them. If you like cooked pasta and noodles... eat them. It's all about personal portions, moderation and balance and no foods are inherently bad/good, healthy/unhealthy.

Fry garlic,onion and bell pepper in some oil until soft. Make the orange sauce and set aside. When the tofu is done add to the frying pan along with the cauliflower. Pour over the sauce and allow to thicken for 5-10 minutes. Boil the rice noodles. Combine the noodles and orange tofu sauce. Add some cashews on top!! ▪︎ ARE YOU A FAN OF ADDING FRUIT TO YOUR MEALS?

user_11;user_11177.jpg;"Always overeating in the evenings? One of the questions i get asked about on a weekly basis. ▪︎ Eating large portions in the evening or maybe eating a whole chocolate bar or maybe a mini buffet style snack in the evening isn't the same as overeating, losing control or binge eating. ▪︎ Are you someone who feels non stop hunger in the evenings? Feel like you can't stop eating? Or if you eat one slice of bread or one cookie then you eat the whole package or think ""all or nothing?"" ▪︎ Then my recommendation for you is: ▪︎ LOOK at how you eat in a whole day. Do you eat regular meals including 1-2 snacks? (Such as these raw cookies are a good inbetween meal snack!) ▪︎ ARE your meals filling and leave you satisfied i.e not just full. You can get full from drinking coffee or just eating a whole bowl of broccoli but it won't leave you satisfied. ▪︎ DO you eat carbs, protein and healthy fats at the majority of your meals? ▪︎ DO you drink enough water throughout the day? ▪︎ DO you get energy from the food you eat? Do you eat the right sized portions? ▪︎ Often non stop hunger or binging in the evenings is a result of not eating enough energy in the day. Or not eating all the macros or not feeling satisfied after eating. It can be a result of conscious or unconscious longterm restricting. ▪︎ Eating regular mealtimes. Eating a balanced diet and most of all allowing yourself to eat all foods guilt free are important steps to finding food balance. ▪︎ If you struggle with bulimia, binge eating or emotional eating then there is help out there. I can recommend the ebook ""how to overcome emotional eating"" which is part of the vegan ebook bundle (linked in my bio!). However for diagnosed eating disorders then proffessional treatment is recommended. ▪︎ But look at your overall diet and ask yourself these questions! ▪︎ DATE-CHOCOLATE COOKIES - REXIPE COMING ▪︎ #vegan #healthycooking #healthawareness #kost #kostvetare #plantpowered #vegannutrition #user_11 #eatsbyizzy #valjvego #snack #snacks #advice #healthyfood #chocolatelover #veganfood #govegan #vegetarian #foodforthought #nutritionadvice #nutrition #nutritionist #foodfredom #realrecovery #recoverywarriors"
user_11;user_11178.jpg;"Building a buddha bowl..... ▪︎ I.e placing ingredients separately in your bowl to make it look pretty.... and then mixing it all up and adding more sauce 😉 ▪︎ So what actually is a buddha bowl.... well according to Wikipedia (very reliable source 😅#unistudent ) ➡️ ""A Buddha bowl is a vegetarian meal, served on a single bowl or high-rimmed plate, which consists of small portions of several foods, served cold. These may include whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice, plant proteins such as chickpeas or tofu, and vegetables."" ▪︎ Basically.... grab your favourite foods and add to a deep bowl. The more fillings the better 😂 ▪︎ If you have times where you don't know what to eat... throw everything into a bowl.. call it a buddha bowl.

user_11;user_11181.jpg;Is intuitive eating just another trend diet...? ▪︎ Intuitive eating isn't perfect and it's not a diet in the sense of paleo, keto, HCLF. ▪︎ Intead of setting food rules about how, what, when you can eat... it's the opposite. It's BREAKING those rules. Beginning to trust and listen to your body again. ▪︎ Intuitive eating is about MAKING peace with food. Finding balance. NOT seeing food as a cheat. NOT feeling guilty when eating and breaking the all or nothing mindset. ▪︎ Intuitive eating may mean you eat pasta and ketchup for a whole week. It may mean eating chips or chocolate four days a week... but generally it soon balances itself out... where you also crave vegetables, fruit, homecooked meals and allow yourself to eat all types of food without guilt. Creating YOUR OWN balance. ▪︎ However... intuitive eating doesn't work for everyone. Have an eating disorder where your hormones are imbalanced or your control and fear around food won't let you listen to your body. Or your signals don't work so you don't feel hungry. ▪︎ Maybe you're taking medicine that affects your hunger signals. Maybe you're burnt out and have no appetite. Maybe you're an elite athlete or need to gain weight and therefore need to eat more than you like. Or maybe you need to lose weight for health reasons and therefore listening to your body might not be possible. ▪︎ Regardless if intuitive eating is for you or not... the principles of, eating without guilt. 🎉 Eating everything in moderation and balance but also being ok with the days or times you eat alot of certain foods. Allowing variation. Eating for nourishment but also for enjoyment. ▪︎ Taking care of your body... treating your body with care i.e by nourishing it and doing a form of exercise you enjoy.➡️ Letting food be part of your life.. not your whole life. ▪︎ I will always promote intuitive eating and most of all finding food balance and eating GUILT FREE. But i am also aware that just listening to your body doesn't work for everyone and maybe not all periods of your life. ▪︎ Intuitive eating also means being practical➡️ even if you aren't hungry you may need to eat anyway. Or eating the chocolate after dinner instead of first.
user_11;user_11182.jpg;One pot pasta 🙌🙌🥦 ▪︎ In a pot fry red onion and garlic until brown (note you can also fry some tofu/temprh/vegan meatballs at the same time... and then remove once cooked). ▪︎ Add c.a 400ml water, 1 vegetable stock along with pasta around 300-400g dry weight.*just enough water to cover the pasta* ▪︎ Allow to boil. Add in brocccoli and other choice of vegetables such as tomatoes, bell pepper, chickpeas. ▪︎ Pour in around 400-500ml oatcream, 2 tbsp tomato paste and 150ml crushed tomatoes to the pot.

user_11;user_11184.jpg;This weeks mealprep inspiration is a little different than usual... Rice paper rolls as your lunch box inspiration. 🙌 #thinkoutsidethebox ▪︎ What's your mealprep or meal ideas for next week? ▪︎ Ok... so these do require you eating them with your hands which maybe not everyone wants to do. They may also require two lunch boxes i.e one for the rolls, the other for the sauce. ▪︎ But they are a super tasty lunch and even good on the go... even if some people think they look a little weird due to the rice paper. ▪︎ I filled mine with rice noodles, veggies, fried tofu and made a peanut butter dressing. ▪︎ You could make a big batch and keep stored in the fridge (make sure to have a lid or cover!). And of course... getting in those veggies and micros 🥬🥦 ▪︎ and if you don't find these filling for lunch they make a great snack. I personally love them both as a snack or main meal 🙌 ▪︎ Mealprep can be whatever you want it to be... leftovers. Ingredients. Pie or lasagna made directly in the boxes. Homemade sushi. Veggies and hummus... lunch box filled with burgers and fries 😉🙌🙄 ▪︎
user_11;user_11185.jpg;Sometimes you just need to throw ingredients and call it a meal 😅 This week i have barely had any time to cook or make recipes so then these throw together meals are my go to! And they are still tasty. ▪︎ I baked the sweet potato in the oven for c.a 35 minutes and also made the garlicrqsted haricots verts and fred tempeh in some oil and seasoning. ▪︎ To make the haricots verts: combine the beans, oil, crushed garlic, salt and pepper. Bake in the oven c.a 30 minutes at 200C. For the sweet potato poke holes in the potato and bake in the oven around 40 minutes (turning over after half the time!) ▪︎ You could of course turn this into a one pan meal by baking everything on the same pan 😉 Simplicity is key right! ▪︎ Many people like the meat,potatoes and veggies and here you see a vegan version of that type of meal... just more nutritious 😉 ▪︎ Are you more of an actual recipe type of person or combining ingredients 😂😅 ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #vegandinner #veganlunch #healthyfood #thefeedfeedvegan #worldwidevegan #foodfredom #realrecovery #recoverywarriors #plantbaseddinner #thevegansclub #valjvego #icastudent #nutritionadvice #nutrition #vegannutrition #healthyfood #eatsbyizzy #goodoldvegan #bestofvegan #buddhabowl #cheapfood #cheapveganfood #vegetarianfood #vegetarianrecipes
user_11;user_11186.jpg;You may or may not know.... but making your own whipped coconut cream is super easy.

user_11;user_11189.jpg;Roast vegetables will always be my go to meal. If someone told me i could only eat roasted vegetables for the rest of my life i would not complain..... well aside from in summer when my apartment turns into a sauna whenever i use my oven! 😂😂 Anyone else...? ▪︎ Also if you don't like brussel sprouts i recommend roasting them. Either with some garlic and salt or do a sweet/balsamic coating.... soooo good. ▪︎ NUTRITION FACTS: Brussel sprouts are a great source of vitamin C, which works as antioxidant and important for your immine system. Also rich in vitamin K, which helps with bloog clotting and can be found in other kale vegetables. Also...surprisinigly they are also a source of protein... maybe not your go to protein source but they do have some 😉 So if people say that only meat has protein... they're wrong 🥬🥦 ▪︎ And sweet potato provides you with alot of vitamin C, fibre and vitamin A which is important for eyesight and your immune system. ▪︎ Just two different vegetables can provide you with so many nutrients. The different colours and varieties of vegetables the better. ▪︎ You don't need to go all out and become a vegetable lover or only eat vegetables to get the health and nutrition benefits. But dare to test different veggies. Add them to meals. Prepare them in different ways. Try to eat a bunch of different fruits and veggies throughout the day and you will be providing your body and mind with alot of important nutrients and antioxidants 🥑🥔🥕 ▪︎ Also a little FYI using some oil will help with the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins( A,D, E, K) 🙌🙌 ▪︎ ▪︎ #vegan #health #nutritionadvice #healthcoach #veganerisverige #veganskmat @goodoldvegan @thevegansclublifestyle #thefeedfeed #veganblogger #veganfoodspot #healthyfood #tastyfood #plantbasedfood #plantbaseddinner #lunch #dinner #vegandinner #thefeedfeed #whatveganseat #plantpowered #eatsbyizzy

user_11;user_11191.jpg;A grey and rainy day definitely requires this sweet potato, peanut butter and kale stew which i made as my mealprep last week (?) 😍😍🙌 ▪︎ This is the type of meal i can eat on repeat. Both warm or cold. It's filling, easy to make and nutritious! ▪︎ You can of course skip the rice with this meal... just eat the stew with some broccoli and bread on the side works. And of course you can swap the peanut butter for almond butter and added some salted and roasted almonds on top 😍 ▪︎ Sooooo don't know what to make this evening then this is definitely a meal to try. Vegan... vegetarian... flexitarian.. everyone will love it 😍😍🙌 ▪︎ Also yesterday i asked in my stories what YOUR definition of healthy eating is and it was so interesting to read your responses. Wholefoods, balance, eating without guilt, being ok with eating all foods, 80/20, eating for nourishment and enjoyment were all some responses. ▪︎ Healthy eating is so individual and not always easy to define.

But you could make it simple with just rice, tempeh/tofu and veggies... or just roast the veggies and bake tempeh at the same time 👌 ▪︎ The smokey sauce ingredients: 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 240ml ketchup 60ml water 60ml apple cider vinegar 60ml brown sugar 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon cayenne ▪︎ Combine together in a pot and heat on medium for 10-15 minutes. ▪︎ ▪︎ For the cookie dough balls i combined: 1,5 can chickpeas. C.a40- 60g oats. 2 tbsp peanut butter. Vanilla. Stevia. Mixed until a dough like consistency (c.a 1 minute MAX). Added chocolate chips. Formed into balls.

user_11;user_11193.jpg;"Just a reminder.... what you see online isn't always true ▪︎ I've made a video talking about this topic before... but what people post isn't always what they eat. ▪︎ I've used this photo before to represent ""my portion vs serving size"" and the fact that i get people telling me i eat too much/too large portions. But that is the portion size i eat. ▪︎ However... there are times i may portion out my food and 3/4 into the meal be full and eat the rest later. Or for example this morning with my pancake stack... i ate 3 for breakfast and the rest later as a snack. ▪︎ It's easy for people to compare their intake with others online... so many full days of eating. So many ""how to eat or what to eat posts"". And somewhere along the way forget to listen to their own bodies signals. ▪︎ Forget how much or when others eat and instead ask yourself ""how much do I need?""... ""what do i want to eat?""... ""do i enjoy the food i am eating?"". ▪︎ You can of course get inspired by what others eat (i do anyway) but don't compare amounts or times someone else eats because you never know what someone else eats. Not to mention everyone has different requirements anyway. ▪︎ NOTE - it can of course be vice versa... people show a tiny bowl of food. Or a small salad but in actuality eat alot more than shown. ▪︎ P.s my goal of course is to always be authentic about what i post and eat i.e my portions. But at the same time i don't post everything i eat as that just fuels peoples food obsession and comparison. ▪︎ P.p.s this doesn't mean people don't post what they actually eat.. it's just a reminder that overflowing bowls, smoothies and cheesey or creamy meals can often times be more aesthetically pleasing than ""regular food or portions"" which many content creators know and use.

Apparently you can also soak the chickpeas in cold water or rub with a towel to help! 👌👌 ▪︎ ▪︎ #veganstudent #healthycooking #vegan #veganfoodshare #thefeedfeedvegan #thevegansclub #eatsbyizzy #user_11 #theveganvibe #wholefoodsplantbased #wholefoods #wfpb #govegan #worldwidevegan #food52 #healthyrecipes #veganrecipes #vegansofig #whatveganseat #veganskmat #vadlagarduförveganmatidag #studenteats"
user_11;user_11198.jpg;When you're craving a gourmet sourdough toast with avocado, vegan cream cheese, chilli flakes and herbsalt.... but then realise you're a student and have to keep it basic and cheap 😉😉🤷‍♀️😅🙃 ▪︎ Let's talk bread.... raise your hand if you've heard/read that bread will make you fat.. or gain weight?🙋‍♀️ - Raise two hands if you've heard/read somewhere that bread is unhealthy? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ -  Raise 3 hands(?😂) if you've cut out bread thinking it will make you lose weight, make your healthier or just because you are scared of eating bread? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ ▪︎ Bread has got an incredibly bad reputation... especially in the diet world. And of course overly processed white bread may not provide you with so many nutrients and shouldn't be the base of your diet. But for someone with IBS, eating white bread may be alot easier to digest than wholegrain bread. Or if you have a stomach bug or workout alot... then white bread can provide you with energy without causing gastrointestinal problems. ▪︎ There are many types of bread out there.... wholegrain, sourdough, sodabread, vegetable bread, white bread, protein bread and the list goes on. ▪︎ As a nutritonist my recommendation is to choose wholegrain bread when possible, and choosing ones with seeds can even be beneficial. (Whole grain is a good source of fibre, provide you with important b vitamins, magnesium and iron**. Not to mention can help lower risk of cardiovascular disease). ▪︎ However if bread only makes up a small part of your diet, such as 1-2 slices per day then just choose the bread you like. And focus on what you put on/between your bread slices. Such as add some hummus, lentil spread, nut butter, fried tofu or tofu scramble, vegetables etc ▪︎ Bread itself isn't unhealthy. It's a cheap food and can provide you with many nutrients (depending on which type you buy - or bake yourself). Eat white bread if that is what you prefer... but if you eat bread for everymeal then maybe choosing a whole grain alternative or focusing on choosing nutritious toppings is a good option for you. ▪︎ What about gluten? Unless you have celiac... gluten isn't unhealthy or something you need to avoid. 👌
user_11;user_11199.jpg;What plantbased milks to choose? ▪︎ Now a days there are an abundance of plantbased milks to choose from... oat, soya, nut based, peabased, rice, coconut.... any other I'm missing? ▪︎ But which do you choose? Well, first based on taste and preference. But it might be alot of trial and error to find the one you love. ▪︎ For coffees and hot drinks it's best to choose barista type plantbased milks and not nut based or coconut based as they will just separate or coagulate in the warm liquid. Tips... @oatly ikaffe, @besproud barista mylk or @valio new barista plantbased mylk work great in warm drinks. ▪︎ Second... i do recommend you choose the  non-organic plantbased milks... Why? ▪︎ Because the non organic ones are fortified with calcium, B12 and D-vitamin as well as iodine. As a vegan it is beneficial to choose fortified plantbased milks... even if you shouldn't solely rely on them for your vitamin D and B12.. they are a complimentary source. ▪︎ Also choosing sugar free ones as much as possible. I.e keep the chocolate and vanilla mylks limited. Many plantbased milks... just like non dairy milk do have natural forms of sugar from example the oats. Whereas some alpro soyamilks have added sugar. But as long as you don't drink 1liter a day the sugar amount isn't so relevant. ▪︎ What about calcium or protein? ▪︎ Many plantbased milks have calcium or are fortified with calcium making them equal to dairy milk. But of course... you can read the nutritional value to see if there's alot of calcium or not. Example 125mg per 100ml is similar to dairy mylk and a good amount of calcium. ▪︎ Protein wise.... not quite as similar to dairy milk. The peabased or nutbased may have more protein than the coconut,rice or oatmilk alternatives. But maybe your mylk choice shouldn't be your primary soure of protein anyway. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️😉 ▪︎ And lastly... for environmental reasons i don't recommend almond milk. To produce almonds it requires huge amounts of water... and just isn't the most environmentally friendly option. So if you can choose another alternative.. i do recommend that you do! ▪︎ So... was this helpful?and also... what plantbased milk do you prefer?
