user_7;user_70.jpg;FEAR is not an option.⭐️ . Years and years of my life were driven by fear. I let myself down, I let others down, I kept myself in a miserable place because I was scared. . Scared of eating more food. Scared of gaining weight and my body changing. Scared of feeling the discomfort. Scared of losing control. Scared that if I did all these things and still wasn’t happy, still wasn’t performing as well as I wanted to, that I would be even more miserable because then I wouldn’t have ‘oh it’s because I’m not eating enough/underweight’ as an excuse anymore... . It’s normal to be a little scared of uncertainty and the unknown. . But I’ve learnt that ‘it’s too scary’ and ‘it’s too hard’ are simply excuses. Choices. Limiting beliefs. . YES, it’s hard. But you can do hard things. Nothing changes if nothing changes, and letting fear hold you back from pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, facing discomfort and actually making changes, then you can’t expect things to be different. . Feel the fear. Do it anyway. 🦋 . Wearing @fortify_gear ~ my code is ‘Nina’ ✨
user_7;user_71.jpg;VANILLA BERRY OVERNIGHT OATS🍓✨ you know you’re going to have a great day when it starts like this! . I always get asked how I make my overnight oats so thick and creamy, so I thought I’d share a few more recipes for your inspiration🙌🏼 . TO MAKE them: ▪️soak your oats overnight by covering them in boiling water. This makes for super soft + easy to digest oats! ▪️in the morning, combine 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein powder, 1 tbsp flaxmeal + 1/2 cup @purecocobella coconut water, mix well and allow to form a pudding. ▪️combine this pudding with your soaked oats and a handful of frozen raspberries. ▪️spoon into a bowl + top with your choice of toppings. I added banana, trail mix and pistachio almond butter🌝 . Not only DELICIOUS but will keep you energised + satiated for hours!💛💛
user_7;user_72.jpg;Avoiding PASTA?🤔 if you are still subscribing to the belief that pasta is an unhealthy or ‘bad’ food choice, I want you to seriously question where that thought comes from... . It’s easy to fall into the trap thinking a food is ‘bad’ from things that we hear and read, mainly on social media or in magazines, or amongst friends etc. . But I want you to ask yourself: why? What’s so bad about it? . Pasta can be not only a delicious, filling, energising, easy and cheap meal but ALSO an incredibly nutritious and wholesome one🙌🏼 . Think about it: ▪️choose a whole grain or legume based pasta and you’ve got a great source of filling complex carbs, dietary fibre, B vitamins and protein. ▪️pair it with a veggie-based sauce and you’ve got even more fibre, vitamins, minerals + antioxidants. . ▪️make it flavoursome with fresh or dried herbs, garlic and spices (and a good sprinkling of cashew Parmesan😍), for all the taste satisfaction. . The word bad does not belong here🤚🏼♥️ . P.S. Zucchini noodles is not pasta. It’s vegetables. Just saying.
user_7;user_73.jpg;#VEGAN FRENCH TOAST🤤🤤 I don’t know why it took me 5 years of plant based eating to try making vegan French toast...let’s blame it on the fact that I only had it a handful of times in my entire life🤷🏼‍♀️ . ▪️high protein. ▪️high fibre. ▪️really easy + quick to make. ▪️soft and moist inside with a golden crust. Amazing. . 👉🏼topped with banana + @99th_monkey hazelnut butter (aka. Nutella)🙌🏼 . This ideal breakfast, brunch or snack recipe is up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio!!💛💛
user_7;user_74.jpg;REAL glad I meal prepped these Curried Sweet Potato Lentil Patties this week👏🏼🌱 coaching evening CrossFit classes I usually get home kinda late and tired ~ so it’s gotta be quick + easy. That little bit of planning and preparation goes such a long way and you truly never regret it ~ am I right or am I right? 🌝 . Served them with a quick side salad for some extra freshness + crunch! . For the mixed salad 👉🏼 baby spinach, lettuce, homegrown lentil sprouts, roasted zucchini, mini gherkins + @mindfulfoods Teriyaki Munchies, drizzled in raspberry balsamic vinegar. A GOOD combo💛
user_7;user_75.jpg;#VEGAN CHOCOLATE YOGHURT🤤 by now, you all know I’m crazy for my homemade vegan Greek yoghurt. It’s a great deal cheaper than store bought yoghurt, high in calcium + protein, easy to make, turns out thick and creamy AND tastes amazing 👏🏼👏🏼 . BUT did you know that you can also turn it into different flavours? Like this choc yoghurt just like the one I grew up loving🥺 perfect with banana + cereal, on top of oats or crunchy granola. . RECIPE: 1 cup homemade soy yog (recipe is up on my blog) 1-2 tbsp cacao powder 1 tbsp maple syrup or sweetener of choice 1 tsp lemon juice Optional, drop of vanilla extract . . 👉🏼Mix it all together until well combined and enjoy!!💛💛 . OR instead of cacao powder and sweetener, I sometimes add a scoop of @switch_nutrition choc Adrenal Switch instead, which tastes AMAZING + has the additional benefits of boosting the magnesium content to aid muscle recovery even further. My code is NINA10 🌝
user_7;user_76.jpg;INTUITIVE EATING ~ listening to your body. Eating when your hungry and stopping when you’re satisfied. Sounds ideal right?🌝 . But is it appropriate for eating disorder recovery? . #truth is, if you’ve struggled with an eating disorder or known someone who has, you’ll also know that recovery from an eating disorder is so much more complicated than ‘just eating’ and honouring those body cues becomes a virtually impossible task when: ▪️you’ve been ignoring + suppressing them for months to years. . ▪️your mind is plagued with disordered thoughts and beliefs around what + how much you should/shouldn’t be eating and what is adequate. ▪️your hormones and digestion are compromised to a point where you aren’t even getting accurate physical cues. ▪️your nutritional needs for recovery and healing are high!! Eating to ‘hunger’ would mean you simply don’t meet those needs... . Both in my personal and professional experience, meal plans are an IMPORTANT tool and stepping stone on the path to recovery from an eating disorder where the end goal is being able to eat intuitively again🙏🏼 . Read exactly WHY, what this involves + everything else you need to know about intuitive eating VS meal plans in ED recovery up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio!💛
user_7;user_77.jpg;Hands up for TACO TUESDAY🙌🏼 made these Spicy Mexican Pulled Jackfruit Tacos for dinner the other night and they’re tooo good. Can’t not share the recipe 😍 . If you haven’t yet tried jackfruit, it’s a fruit yes, but the unripe tinned stuff makes a great plant based meat alternative👏🏼🌱 it has a texture similar to pulled pork or chicken, and a neutral flavour so easily takes on the taste of whatever you add to it. In this case, a killer marinade!🔥 . RECIPE: 150g plain @amazoniaco tender jack 1 small onion 1 tsp cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp each onion and garlic powder 1 tsp tamari or soy sauce 1/2 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp tomato paste . 1️⃣Cook diced onion with spices in a non-stick pan until soft. Drain jackfruit, remove any seeds + pull it apart to ‘shred’ it. 2️⃣Add jackfruit, lemon, tamari and tomato paste, and sauté until sauce is thick. 3️⃣Serve in tortillas (I used homemade chickpea flour ones) with lettuce, chickpeas + avocado!!🥑💛
user_7;user_78.jpg;MAPLE CARROT CAKE DONUTS 🌝🥕✨ no week of mine goes by without some snack prep ~ usually some kind of wholesome baked good, but also frequent appearances are made by bliss balls, protein bars, Bircher muesli or homemade bread. Preparation is key to good snacking👏🏼👏🏼 . When I’m short on time or just not really in the mood for meal prep, the @macr0mike baking mixes are actual life savers. Easy, taste amazing, great ingredients + they don’t spike my blood sugars either🥰 . This week I made these soft + fluffy Maple Carrot Cake Donuts with a #vegan cream cheese PB frosting. Enough said🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 1 @macr0mike Maple Cinnamon Donut Mix (my code is NINA10) 1-2 carrots, grated 2/3 cup almond milk . . 1️⃣Preheat oven to 180°C and prepare your donut tray. 2️⃣Combine all ingredients, then divide equally into 6 donut holes. Bake for 20 minutes until golden + a skewer comes out clean. 3️⃣Allow to cool before removing from tin + frosting. . For the frosting, combine equal parts @madewithplants original cream cheese + @macr0mike protein PB with 1 tsp orange zest and enough almond milk to make a thick spread. Slather on donuts!💛💛
user_7;user_79.jpg;Morning rituals🌝✨ creamy choc gingerbread protein overnight oats ft. ALL the toppings. What are your favourites? . Speaking of TOPPINGS, here are some reasons why I’m a big fan: ✅they add flavour + variety. A great way to keep things interesting and delicious. ✅they add texture. Crunch. Something creamy. Something fresh + fruity. All about that satisfaction. ✅they add extra micronutrients. Fruit adds extra vitamins + antioxidants, whilst nuts, seeds and nut butters are an amazing source of healthy fats + important minerals, such as iron, zinc, selenium + magnesium. ✅they up the energy content. Oats by themselves aren’t a very high energy breakfast, but adding plenty of toppings is a great way to increase that to ensure you’re meeting your requirements! . Here we have 👉🏼 banana, frozen mango, trail mix + @99th_monkey almond butter 💛
user_7;user_710.jpg;#vegan CHORIZO LENTIL PIE🤩 a total experiment that turned out seriously delish, if I do say so myself🙌🏼 . This is one of those kitchen hack recipes that take next to no time to make ~ yet is packed with flavour and super satiating due to the high protein + fibre content. It also happens to be a great source of iron, zinc + other important minerals. And tastes like an actual pie. I hope you’re sold👏🏼🕺🏼 . TO MAKE IT >> add 1 pack of @lomalinda_brand chorizo mix with a can of lentils to a food processor and blend until almost smooth but not quite. Stir in a handful of fresh parsley. Spoon filling into your favourite pie crust (I used a homemade one from sorghum flour, flaxmeal, a pinch of salt + water), then bake for 30 minutes until golden. ENJOY served with a side salad for a great meal prep lunch or dinner💛💛

The perfect snack to tie you over between meals or refuel after a workout, paired with a banana ⚡️⚡️ thanks to the addition of @switch_nutrition vanilla bean protein switch to pack a real plant protein punch!

user_7;user_713.jpg;Back again with another wholesome BUDDHA BOWL🤩🌱 because these meals offer so much variety + flavour diversity that I just never get bored of them! . I tried the @beansupremefood Masala burger this time which is made from chickpeas, cauliflower + quinoa and it’s definitely my new FAVOURITE.

ENJOY!!💛💛 . #beansupreme #beansupremepartner #supremelybetter #foreveryone
user_7;user_714.jpg;13 YEARS to this exact day I have been living with type 1 diabetes 🤭💉 That’s more than half my life. I remember that day like it was yesterday, turning my life (and my family’s!) on it’s head. And whilst every single day with diabetes is a challenge, it has also taught me SO much. I truly believe it has made me a better, stronger and much more resilient and determined person. . In honour of today, I thought I’d share a few lesser know FACTS about type 1 diabetes: ▪️Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. It isn’t caused by lifestyle or dietary factors. There is no cure to date. ▪️A type 1 diabetic doesn’t produce the hormone insulin, needed to allow glucose to be taken up by cells to be used for energy. Because of this, diabetics need to inject themselves with insulin + closely monitor their blood glucose levels 24/7. Essentially, we do the job our pancreas should be doing! ▪️Without insulin, I would become very ill and die within a few days. Grim I know, but this is a BIG problem in many countries where insulin is incredibly expensive and many type 1s struggle to access enough of it. ▪️Type 1 diabetes is the ONLY medical condition where the patient has to decide/adjust their doses of medication on a daily basis, and getting this wrong could seriously put their lives at risk. ▪️It’s not just carbs that affect blood glucose levels! There are a total of 42 different factors that do, from more obvious ones like exercise, carb intake + GI, to hormones, sleep + climate. ▪️A type 1 diabetic makes an average of around 180 extra diabetes related decisions per day! . I resented my diabetes for a long few years. Asking myself ‘why me?’ and letting it control my life and my mood far too much. And while I definitely still have those days, I’ve realised that having diabetes is something I can’t change. It’s a fact. What I CAN change is my mindset and how I deal with it. . Diabetes is a huge part of me and my life. But it does not define me. ♥️
user_7;user_715.jpg;NOURISH BOWLS ~ will we ever get sick of them?😛👏🏼 the answer is clearly no way! . Was feeling a little adventurous this week so I tried making some homemade #vegan sausages for my meal prep >>> the ingredients are just white beans, mushrooms, chickpea flour + a bunch of herbs and spices. Absolutely YUM🙌🏼✅ . Paired them with steamed veg, more white beans, greens, mashed avo + the essential mustard. Turned out to be too filling for my own good and I genuinely regret adding so much veg to this meal. If you know, you know🤰🏼😂
user_7;user_716.jpg;VANILLA CHOC CHIP PROTEIN COOKIES🍪✨ these were absolutely yum as can be! . I’m back on the cookie baking train as they are just so easy and quick to make, and perfect to have as snacks or dessert with a hot mug of tea🙌🏼 . I used @eimele_australia Plant Based Meal Replacement Shake powder in vanilla flavour for these ~ basically a wholesome plant protein powder with a whole bunch of added nutrients, like iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, B12 + more🌱👏🏼👏🏼 They taste too good to be this good for you... . RECIPE: 1 cup sorghum or oat flour 2 sachets @eimele_australia Plant Based Meal Replacement Shake vanilla 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 cup maple or date syrup 3/4 cup plant milk Handful of dark chocolate . . 1️⃣Preheat your oven to 180°C and line a tray with baking paper. 2️⃣Combine dry ingredients in a bowl, then stir in syrup and milk to make the batter. 3️⃣Place spoonfuls of the batter onto your tray to make cookies, I made 8. Then top with chopped chocolate. 4️⃣Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden, then allow to cool. ENJOY!!💛💛
user_7;user_717.jpg;How many CALORIES do I need?🤨 time to answer one of your frequently asked questions... . I can’t tell you. There, that’s the truth. And honestly, if you message any person/influencer/health professional on social media with this question and they give you a number, then I’d run FAR away👎🏼👎🏼 . There are SO many different factors that go into an individual’s energy requirements, these include but are not limited to: ▪️age and gender. ▪️height, weight and body composition. ▪️activity levels (both day to day activity and exercise/training). ▪️health history + any medical conditions. ▪️health and performance goals. . That’s not even taking into consideration the adaptive nature of metabolism, our gut microbiome, daily variances and the HUGE margin of error that comes both with measuring energy expenditure + calorie intake ‼️ . Whilst I appreciate every single message and question I get and LOVE helping you in any way I can, if you send me a DM asking me how many calories you should be eating a day, I can’t and will not give you a number. Both professionally + ethically. . Rather than worrying about calories, a thing you CAN do is aim for a wide variety of different foods + ask yourself ‘Am I giving my body enough of what it needs for me to feel and function at my best?’ 🙏🏼 . And of course, if you are unsure about your nutrition or need help in determining what or how much you need to eat to best support your body, performance + goals, the best thing you can do is work with a registered nutrition professional (such as 🙋🏼‍♀️) for individual + tailored advice. . Nutrition is SO much more than just calories.♥️
user_7;user_718.jpg;Here’s the TRUTH: You’re probably never going to feel 100% ready to make a change. It’s not going to get easier to start. There won’t be a perfect time. The right time is now♥️ . It’s so easy to tell ourselves ‘oh it’s too hard. I’m just not ready, I’ll wait until it feels easier’ . Or the classic ‘I’ll start tomorrow’ or next week, or after this or that event...I repeated this cycle in my head for YEARS. And what happened? Years passed and I didn’t get anywhere. Things didn’t get easier. In fact, it just got harder to change because I got so used to the things I was stuck doing 🤚🏼 . . Start now. Start where you are. Start with fear. . . Change is always hard. New things are always challenging and unfamiliar and take a while to master. But you don’t get any closer to reaching the place you want to be by putting off making those necessary changes and practicing those things on a daily basis. . . When you first start learning to tie your shoelaces it seems so complicated and tricky. Now you can probably do it with your eyes closed. . When you go for your very first driving lesson, it’s so scary and there are so many things to remember that you don’t think you’ll ever be able to drive. Fast forward a year or so and it’s almost second nature! . You can apply this to pretty much every new thing. Whether that’s a physical habit or behaviour, or a mindset and way of thinking. . Everything seems impossible until it’s done✨🌻🌝 . Wearing @fortify_gear ~ my code is ‘Nina’ 💛
user_7;user_719.jpg;Is there anything more cosy than tucking into a warming bowl of carrot cake oats?😌✨🥕 and these VANILLA CHAI CARROT CAKE OATS are bursting with flavour + nutrient goodness👏🏼 . To up the protein, add extra flavour and a whole lot of extra micronutrients as a bonus ~ I added a scoop of @wholeearthandsea_aus Organic Fermented Protein + Greens in vanilla chai flavour. I love that the formula is made with organic whole plant foods, including a blend of different proteins to include all the essential amino acids, greens + mushrooms. The fact it’s fermented makes it easier to digest and improves absorption + bioavailability of nutrients 🙌🏼🌱 . Plus: it’s YUM🌝 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 cup cashew milk 1 grated carrot 1 tsp cinnamon Zest of 1/2 orange, grated 1 scoop @wholeearthandsea_aus Organic Fermented Protein + Greens vanilla chai 1 tbsp flaxmeal Toppings of your choice! . 1️⃣Cover oats with boiling water and soak overnight. 2️⃣In the morning, add soaked oats, milk, cinnamon, grated carrot + orange zest to a pot and bring to the simmer. Cook until thick and creamy. 3️⃣Add protein + flaxmeal, stirring until nice and fluffy. 4️⃣Spoon into a bowl and add toppings of choice. I added more carrot, apricot jam, dried mulberries + nut butter. ENJOY 💛💛
user_7;user_720.jpg;BUDDHA BOWL lovin’😋🌱 With the cooler weather, most of my meals look somewhat like this to bring a little brightness back ~ colourful, veggie-packed Buddha bowls. Super easy to throw together and so YUM🙌🏼 . I recently discovered the @beansupremefood range of plant based burgers and I absolutely love how tasty, wholesome + convenient they are. Perfect for adding to my bowls, or to use in burgers + wraps👅 . TO MAKE IT: 1️⃣Roast beetroot, carrot + zucchini sprinkled with mixed herbs, at 200°C for about 40 minutes until soft. 2️⃣Pan fry @beansupremefood Beetroot Burger for 3 minutes each side or until warmed through. 3️⃣To make the ‘cheesy’ dip/sauce, combine 2 tbsp coconut yoghurt with 2 tbsp nutritional yeast + 1 tsp Dijon mustard and mix well. 4️⃣Assemble your bowl with a base of fresh greens, the roasted veggies + burger, dry roasted chickpeas and ‘cheesy’ sauce. ENJOY💛💛 . #beansupreme #beansupremepartner #supremelybetter #foreveryone
user_7;user_721.jpg;Some people have carrot and celery sticks for snacks, I make pancakes🤪 And yes this was in fact a snack. I used to ashamed of eating. I used to think eating less is better, healthier, made me the better person... . Truth is, what IS BEST is eating to your needs. I wouldn’t be able to sustain my training snacking on veggie sticks. I’d risk not only my performance but also my health, so pancakes it is👏🏼👏🏼 . This plate of goodness was made using @macr0mike pancake mix with grated zucchini, topped with fresh strawbs, @99th_monkey almond butter + crumbled @snack_proud cashew butter cookie. Perfect pre-training fuel if I do say so myself🥺💛💛
user_7;user_722.jpg;You know what time of the year it is?🤫 SOUP WEATHER!! Nothing more cosy and warming than a steamy bowl of homemade curried pumpkin soup✨🍵 . Because soup tends to be just a bunch of veg with stock and spices, I always like to add a protein-rich side to make it a balanced and filling meal. Today that was 👉🏼 toasted Best Ever Gluten Free Bread, spread generously with sundried tomato white bean dip + a fresh kale. Delish!! . SUNDRIED TOMATO WHITE BEAN DIP 1 can butter beans, drained 2 cloves garlic 2 tbsp sundried tomatoes 1 tsp dried oregano 2 heaped tbsp tahini Juice of 1/2 a lemon Salt and pepper, to taste . . 1️⃣Add all ingredients to a food processor. Blend until super smooth and creamy. 2️⃣Spread on toast or use as a dip for crackers, veg etc!!
user_7;user_723.jpg;ROAST VEG BOWL with TOFU RICOTTA🤤🌱 who wants in?? . Such a simple, flavour packed and filling meal. This super creamy homemade herbed tofu ricotta is something I used to make ALL the time...but had totally forgotten about. A comeback was about time!👏🏼👏🏼 . Vegan dairy alternatives tend to be very very expensive and not even that delicious when store bought (if you ask me!). Not only does this tofu ricotta taste OUT of this world ☄️, but it’s also packed full of protein, iron and calcium, which those store bought alternatives generally lack. . Hot tip: you may just want to double this recipe so you get to have leftovers the next day! . The RECIPE is up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio 💛💛
user_7;user_724.jpg;How many of you struggle with BLOATING?🤭💓 probably one of the most common complaints people reach out to me about! . And here’s the #TRUTH that we aren’t often told: being a little bloated sometimes is a totally normal part of being a living human being ⭐️ . We can get bloated when: ✅we eat a little more than our stomachs would have liked. ✅ate too fast. ✅are stressed.. ✅didn’t get enough sleep. ✅didn’t chew our food properly. ✅didn’t drink enough (or drank too much!) water. ✅drank carbonated/fizzy drink. ✅ate some foods we don’t usually eat. ✅or maybe it’s that time of the month... I’m totally with you that it’s a little inconvenient and uncomfortable, but it passes🙂 . Although bloating CAN be a sign of food intolerances or an underlying gut disorder, most of the time it really isn’t. In fact, MOST of the time it’s because you’ve been scrolling on Instagram whilst eating and ended up inhaling your food + not chewing properly... But if bloating IS a persistent struggle for you and causes you significant discomfort on a regular basis ~ please reach out to a qualified nutrition professional (such as 🙋🏼‍♀️) who can help you get to the bottom of it. . What NOT to do: Cut out lots of foods, buy expensive gut supplements or ‘gut healing programs’, do a juice cleanse or consult Dr. Google and ‘influencers’ claiming they know how to ‘heal your gut’👎🏼 . Let me know if you have any questions about this topic! 💛✨
user_7;user_725.jpg;SALTED CARAMEL CHOC CHIP Soft Baled Cookies🥺✨ these are absolutely heavenly 👉🏼 SWIPE for that close up view! . A few months ago I went through a real cookie baking phase, that I almost completely forgot about...until now👏🏼 I love how easy these are to make, with just a few simply ingredients and no blending required! . They’re packed full of plant protein + fibre, which makes them very filling. But also soft, sweet and cakey. Basically a fudge cookie. You’re welcome👅 . RECIPE: 100g buckwheat (or oat) flour 100g @pranaon Salted Caramel power plant protein (my code is NINA10) 1 tsp baking powder 2 tsp maca powder 1 tbsp psyllium husk 1.5 cup plant milk 50g dark chocolate . . 1️⃣Preheat oven you 180°C and line a tray with baking paper. 2️⃣Combine dry ingredients, then slowly add plant milk until you reach a thick cookie batter. You may need a little more or less depending on your flour/protein (I didn’t actually measure the amount!!). 3️⃣Form into 6 large cookies on your tray, then top with chopped chocolate. Bake for 15 minutes until golden. ENJOY!!💛💛
user_7;user_726.jpg;I am really LOVING one pot meals at the moment. And this Creamy Tomato White Bean Stew just takes the cake!🥺🙌🏼 . It’s quick + easy, packed full of flavour and creaminess, and just an all-round hearty, filling and satisfying meal. A good balance of plant protein, complex carbs and healthy fats in a meal always serves to keep me feeling satiated, full and energised, so all the boxes are ticked with this creamy white bean, tomato and veggie hot pot, stew, whatever you like to call it!👏🏼👏🏼 . The perfect meal prep dish to bulk batch and the perfect Winter warmer if I do say so myself♥️ . The RECIPE is up on my blog ~ link is in my bio!!
user_7;user_727.jpg;REFUELLING ~ what should I eat after training?💪🏼⭐️ After exercise, our bodies need proper nutrition in order to rebuild, repair and recover. In order to make positive adaptations to that training stimulus ~ get stronger, faster, fitter and build muscle tissue🌱 . Your ideal recovery meal is a good mix of carbohydrates (the amount depends on the individual, as well as duration + type of training) PLUS 20-30g+ of protein. As well as this, in order to maximise muscle building potential, you want that protein to contain 2-3g of the amino acid leucine✔️ . Leucine is a branched chain amino acid. Whilst plant foods do contain leucine, it’s definitely highest in animal proteins. Most vegan protein powders have added leucine, which combine with the other foods in your recovery meal ~ oats, nuts + seeds, soy milk etc, will ensure you hit that threshold for all your #gainz needs👏🏼👏🏼 . Ideally, you want this meal to be within 30-60 minutes of finishing training to optimise recovery. . In my post-training bowl 👉🏼 overnight oats with flax, cashew milk + @switch_nutrition vanilla bean protein switch (not only tastes amazing but has a really great leucine content!! My code is NINA10), topped with banana, frozen raspberries + raw choc granola💛💛
user_7;user_728.jpg;GREEN VEGGIE CURRY hack👏🏼🌱 I’m obsessed with this quick and easy way of making a killer creamy veggie coconut curry: using @purecocobella coconut yoghurt isn’t of milk...who would have thought?🙌🏼 . Just make sure it’s plain, not vanilla🤪 . A great weeknight meal to use up whatever veggies need using up in your fridge!⭐️ . RECIPE: 1️⃣Sauté onion with green curry paste until fragrant. 2️⃣Add chopped veggies of your choice. I used pumpkin, broccoli stem + green beans, plus a good splash of veggie stock. 3️⃣Then add a tin of white beans or chickpeas, and I also added some tempeh I needed to use up. 4️⃣Once veggies are soft, add a few heaped tbsp of @purecocobella natural coconut yoghurt + squeeze of lime juice. ENJOY!💛💛
user_7;user_729.jpg;EXERCISING WITH DIABETES⭐️ to me, it never even came into question to let type 1 diabetes stop me from training. But I have learnt that that isn’t the norm for diabetics...and I do understand why. . The fear of hypoglycaemia and something happening during or after exercise. All the extra planning + thought that needs to go into adjusting insulin doses and food intake. And then comes the fact that it all changes depending on time of day, type, duration + intensity of exercise. It’s HARD work😅 . And yet, it’s not only so possible, but so incredibly rewarding too. . Being active + doing strength training does absolute wonders for diabetes management. Beyond all the normal benefits to training that we all know by now...it also increases insulin sensitivity + carbohydrate utilisation, and makes blood glucose levels SO much easier to manage👏🏼👏🏼 . The BEST piece of advice I can give for exercising with diabetes, is getting to know YOUR BODY. ✅write things down. Keep a journal of BGLs, food + insulin around exercise so you can learn how your body responds and what happens when you do different types of training. ✅make ONE change at a time. I know it’s tempting to change lots at once, but then you don’t know what caused what. Pick one thing and monitor. ✅ALWAYS keep glucose tablets close by. Enough said. Also, I find glucose best for hypos because it absorbs the quickest. ✅test more. Before, during and after exercise. Catch those lows before they hit you like a truck! . And most importantly, have FUN with it! Yes there will be crappy days and super annoying hypos, but it’s just part of being diabetic. Don’t let it get you down or scare you away from something so positive!! . With a bit of extra planning, preparation + monitoring, type 1 diabetes won’t stop you from anything you set your mind to...unless you decide to let it. I’ve learnt that one the hard way ♥️

They make easy, simple + convenient snacks, especially when you’re time poor or on the go👏🏼 .

user_7;user_733.jpg;Cheesy-stuffed CHICKPEA VEGGIE OMELETTE🤭 SWIPE for that gooey cheesey centre🙌🏼🌱 . Probably my #1 favourite easy meal at the moment (especially when I can’t be bothered cooking or haven’t done any meal prep) + one of the most popular recipes on the blog...it’s high in protein, filling, satisfying and gives an egg omelette a REAL run for its money👏🏼👏🏼 . If there’s any pantry staple you absolutely need in your life, it’s chickpea flour. . . RECIPE is up on my blog ~ and for the ‘cheesy’ filling I just mixed homemade yoghurt with nutritional yeast, a pinch of salt + garlic powder to make a creamy cheese sauce. YUM. 💛
user_7;user_734.jpg;So much of my life I was focused on shrinking myself. Taking up the least amount of space possible. . I thought being the skinniest, the one who exercised the most, worked the hardest and ate the least would make me happy. Accepted. Strong. Successful. . It didn’t give me any of those things. It sucked the joy and life out of me. I became a ghost of myself, only concerned with food, numbers and seeing my scale weight go down. . YET, through all this insanity, a little passion in my heart remained...it was swimming. . Competitive swimming was the fire in my soul. It was the one thing that gave me the strength and determination to stand tall against the demons in my mind and feed myself when they were screaming at me. . . When I was in hospital, I stuck photos from swim meets and cards from my club on my walls. They gave me strength and purpose.⭐️ . It wasn’t enough. I let my fear of the unknown get the better of me. I let it take my sport and future as a competitive swimmer from me. And those few years were the most lost I’d ever felt in my entire life... . Now, I know better. Weightlifting saved me, in a way. It lit the extinguished fire in my heart that swimming once held. It’s given me back my passion and determination, that’s so strong it sometimes overwhelms me. . I no longer seek to make myself smaller. I no longer fear growth. I am focusing all my energy into building myself up. . A wise friend once said to me, ‘You have to decide what you want more: strength and success in sport OR to control what you eat.’ . I know my choice ♥️🏋🏼‍♀️ . P.S. tagged some STRONG women who inspire me every day in so many ways.
user_7;user_735.jpg;WHITE CHOC LEMON CHEESECAKE COOKIE DOUGH😩🍋 serious yums. This match was made for each other. . This crazy simple and quick recipe is packed full of prebiotic fibre to feed that good gut bacteria, high in plant protein, rich in iron AND (most importantly🙃) tastes absolutely deeelish. Zesty, sweet, creamy, satisfying... . Have it for dessert, a snack, even breakfast!!👏🏼👏🏼 . You’ll find the RECIPE up on the blog ~ link is in my bio💛💛
user_7;user_736.jpg;Team oats✌🏼😋 who else started today (everyday) with a bowl of oats? . Oats are fab. They’re cheap, filling, packed with fibre and slow releasing complex carbs for long lasting energy. They’re high in micronutrients like B vitamins, calcium + iron, and a compound called beta-glucans which helps to reduce cholesterol levels🙌🏼 No wonder they were sold out pretty much worldwide the past few weeks🙄 . Anyway, this bowl was creamy vanilla cinnamon protein overnight oats, topped with cinnamon stewed apples, banana, coconut + macadamia nuts 💛✨
user_7;user_737.jpg;Story time: I used to have this absolute NEED to have salad with every single meal🌱 Like if it didn’t have a handful of lettuce or spinach or some other leafy greens with it then it wasn’t acceptable... . It was kind of this ‘rule’ leftover from my ED that felt so normal to me I just accepted it. But only recently realised how important it is to break those rules that aren’t serving you ~ like there’s plenty of veggies in meals like this, and if I don’t feel like raw greens then I don’t need to add them. End of story😎👏🏼 . Anyway, this nourish bowl was a true delight. Sautéed mixed veg with garlic + curry powder, homemade falafel, @mindfulfoods quinoa and creamy tomato salsa dip💛 . CREAMY TOMATO SALSA DIP Combine a heaped tbsp tahini with another heaped tbsp tomato salsa (I used @keepitcleaner), a splash of apple cider vinegar + pinch of salt. Stir until creamy smooth!
user_7;user_738.jpg;Just went to donut heaven🥺♥️ if you love chocolate, hidden veggies that you can’t even taste, and zero effort recipes...these are the donuts for you👏🏼 . CHOC CARROT CAKE DONUTS made with just 3 simple ingredients. They’re soft, fluffy and light. Yet totally decadent and wholesome too. Sprinkles optional, but not really🤪 . RECIPE: 1 pack @macr0mike Easter Egg donut mix (my code is NINA10) 2 medium carrots, grated 1 cup plant milk . 1️⃣Preheat your oven to 180°C and prepare your donut tin. 2️⃣Combine donut mix + carrot in a bowl, then fold in liquid to make the batter. 3️⃣Spoon equally into donut holes, then bake for 25 minutes until golden and a skewer comes out clean. 4️⃣Allow to cool before removing from tin + frosting! . For the frosting👉🏼I mixed @macr0mike Nutella PB powder with @99th_monkey choc hazelnut butter + enough water to make a paste. Delish ✨🍩
user_7;user_739.jpg;Your brain on not enough food 🧠🤚🏼 a few posts ago I talked about how high the energy demand of our brains are ~ taking up about 20% of our daily energy expenditure, with it’s favourite fuel source being glucose (carbs!!)⚡️ . But what can happen to the way our brain functions when we aren’t eating enough? ▪️low mood, feeling down ▪️brain fog and inability to concentrate. ▪️poor memory and confusion ▪️inflexible thinning and becoming very ridged and focused on small things ▪️unable to cope with changes, even small ones ▪️tendency for obsessive compulsive thoughts and behaviours. ▪️reduces ability and desire to socialise . . As well as this, focus on food and food-related thoughts increases. So do negative thoughts around food, exercise and body image. In fact, these thoughts can become so loud that they leave little thinking space for any thing else 💭 . WHY? Well put simply, it’s evolutionary biology. When our brain isn’t receiving adequate energy, it believes a food shortage or famine is occurring. This is not ideal for survival and our brain cannot tell whether we are purposely restricting food, or there just isn’t enough. Focus stays on food because your brain wants you to go FIND food to keep you alive! . If you’re feeling like this, you aren’t obsessed with food. You aren’t crazy. There is nothing wrong with you, other than that you’re feeling the consequences of energy deprivation and inadequate nutritional intake. . . And the BEST thing you can do for freeing up more brain space for things other than food (think friendships, hobbies, careers, relationships...) is making sure that brain + body of yours is properly fuelled🌝💛
user_7;user_740.jpg;Things I’ve LEARNT during iso ~ mainly, the importance of doing ‘unproductive’ things💭 . . Working for myself, coupled with being a total over-achiever and perfectionist, I am definitely one to struggle with always needing to be doing things that are productive. Why rest or take time off when I could be working, writing Instagram or blog posts, developing recipes, researching, learning or watching educational webinars? . The real why is this: We need rest. We NEED to spend time doing things purely out of enjoyment and relaxation, not productivity. . We can’t always be learning and achieving, or we burnt out. . What is the meaning and purpose of life anyway if you’re always doing so much to ‘better yourself or your career’ that you can’t enjoy yourself and just BE in the moment?🌝 . Some things I’ve been doing (and really loving!) are: ▪️reading more. Rereading the entire Harry Potter series to be specific. ▪️watching a series (currently The 100) instead of working in the evenings. ▪️putting my phone away whilst watching movies or series instead of scrolling and missing the show. Turns out things flow so much better when you aren’t distracted! ▪️not replying to emails out of ‘work’ time. ▪️not touching my phone once I’m in bed, other than to check my blood glucose level. ▪️less mindless scrolling. Especially whilst eating. Still working on this one! . Slowing down and taking time for yourself is not time wasted. It’s time WELL invested in your wellbeing. Promise ♥️
user_7;user_741.jpg;‘BUTTER’ TOFU + VEG CURRY👏🏼🤩 the ultimate bowl of wholesome comfort food that leaves you feeling just as good as it tastes✨🌱 . My work day usually finishes around 6:30pm on weekdays, and after that I just don’t have a lot of energy left to cook anything fancy or time consuming. This has been one of my go tos!🙌🏼 . High protein, packed with veg + complex carbs, full of flavour and very satiating. I usually boil a bunch of potatoes in advance to use for dinners + speed up the cooking process✅ . RECIPE: 1/2 small onion 100g firm tofu 1 medium carrot 1 medium boiled potato 1/2 pack @celebratehealth Indian Butter Chicken sauce (it’s #vegan !!) 1/4 can chopped tomato Big handful of other veg, I used mushrooms + Brussel sprouts today . 1️⃣Dice all your veg and tofu, sauté in a pan until golden. 2️⃣Add the sauce and tomato, then simmer until thickened and veggies are just soft. ENJOY!! Topped mine with homegrown sprouts + @mindfulfoods Yummy Beans mix💛💛
user_7;user_742.jpg;VANILLA CAKE protein balls🌝🍰 such an underrated snack to make yourself!! . ✅super (like ridiculously) easy to make. ✅waaay cheaper than buying protein bars + balls. ✅a great protein-packed snack. ✅delish! . I always have a batch of some kind of protein balls in the freeze for snacking on ~ this week, it’s these ones and they actually taste like vanilla cake batter. So. Yum. 🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 150g pitted dates, soaked fo soften 50g rolled oats 50g buckwheat, or cashews 100g vanilla bean plant protein, I used @switch_nutrition (code is NINA10) Water or almond milk, as needed . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients in a food processor or high powered blender + pulse until a ‘dough’ forms. 2️⃣If needed, add a splash of liquid at a time until the mix comes together. 3️⃣Roll into golf ball sized balls. 4️⃣Pop in the freezer to firm. ENJOY!!💛💛
user_7;user_743.jpg;Name a better combo than apple and cinnamon🥺🍎 for Winter, this is the perfect oat topping! . It’s warming, naturally sweet, plus stewed apples contain a special type of fibre called pectin ~ great for gut health, regulating bowel movements and supporting the lining of our gut wall 🌝 . I love to make a big batch of them to add on top of porridge, or have as a snack with my homemade yog. They’re even good on toast, trust me👏🏼 . RECIPE: Dice apple and add to pot with a splash of water + all the cinnamon. Simmer until the apples are soft and water is absorbed, which kind of caramelises the apples! . Served on oats cooked with flaxmeal, cashew milk + @pranaon choc protein. Plus a big dollop of @99th_monkey choc hazelnut butter 💛
user_7;user_744.jpg;'I am learning everyday to allow the space in between where I am and where I want to be inspire me and not terrify me' 🌻🌙✨ . @unit_viii_strength_and_fitness obviously from pre-covid times. Not long now though ♥️🏋🏼‍♀️
user_7;user_745.jpg;If cauliflower can become a donut, then you can do anything you set your mind to🌝🌻 but seriously. Fluffy, soft CHOC BANANA DONUTS made with cauliflower flour mix. Amazing👏🏼 . @pompompaddock sent me some of their cauli flour mix to try out and I’m seriously impressed at the result. A perfect 1:1 alternative for gluten free baking with a great taste. They turned out soft, light and everything you want from a baked donut 🍩 . Enjoy slathered in nut butter with a dusting of cinnamon and steaming mug of tea on the side. My afternoon done right🤗 . RECIPE: 100g @pompompaddock cauli flour mix 1/2 tsp baking powder 1 1/2 large ripe bananas, mashed 1 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 cup almond milk 50g dark chocolate . 1️⃣Preheat your oven to 180°C and prepare a donut tray. 2️⃣Mash banana with vanilla until smooth. 3️⃣Add flour and baking powder to bowl, then fold in banana mix, almond milk and chopped chocolate. 4️⃣Divide mix into 4 donut holes and bake for about 20 minutes until golden. 5️⃣Allow to cool before removing from tin and slathering in nut butter 💛
user_7;user_746.jpg;FACT: Being full is not the enemy!!!🤚🏼 Being full does not mean you have eaten too much, or that you are going to gain weight. Period. . We are MEANT to feel full after eating. That is one of the whole points of eating food. . Furthermore, if you eat a diet mainly composed of fibre-rich and rather high volume whole foods (especially in the beginning!) you will be feeling pretty full after meals in order to actually get enough energy and nutrients 🙏🏼 . And also (!!) if you have high energy needs, are an athlete, recovering from an eating disorder or have lost your appetite due to illness, certain medications and other reasons ~ it may be necessary to push yourself to eat DESPITE feeling full. This is not unhealthy, it’s just a fact. . Whilst it definitely can be a little uncomfortable in the beginning in you’re not used to it, fullness is nothing to fear💛 . You can’t live a full life on an empty stomach.
user_7;user_747.jpg;CHICKPEA TOFU STIR-FRY🌝🌱🍚 This might just be my new favourite thing! I’ve seen chickpea tofu popping up all over my Insta feed lately...yet I was always a little skeptical that it would be big disappointment. But don’t judge a book by its cover right?👏🏼👏🏼 . ✅Super easy to make and low waste too.. ✅Cheap, made from just chickpea flour, water and spices. ✅High in protein, fibre and iron ✅Really surprisingly delicious! . Smooth as can be, it has a texture and taste best described as an ‘eggy’ tofu. Stay tuned for more recipes using this fabulous protein source, as you bet there will be many more to come🤭🙌🏼 . Served this lot of chickpea tofu with a veggie satay stir fry + @mindfulfoods quinoa. . The RECIPE is now up on my blog ~ link is in my bio!💛
user_7;user_748.jpg;Would you like some oats with your toppings?🙃 let’s face it, the more the better when it comes to toppings on oats🙌🏼 . Getting creative with your oat toppings is also a great way to ensure you don’t get bored, and get a variety of different nutrients in your breakfasts too✅👏🏼 . This morn 👉🏼 thick’n creamy oats cooked in cashew milk with flaxmeal, maca, turmeric + @switch_nutrition vanilla bean Protein Switch (my code is NINA10💛). Topped with stewed rhubarb, choc cashew yog, banana + @mindfulfoods granola. Loaded with goodness🌝
user_7;user_749.jpg;You know what tissue has the greatest energy demand of your entire body? Your BRAIN 🧠⭐️ . Yep, that’s right. Thinking and working and studying requires calories too, not just physical activity. . You may have noticed you get extra hungry on days full of study or when you’re doing a lot of work that requires some brain power. And no it’s not just you being lazy or bored, it’s the fact that your brain is using up ENERGY to do all that work🙌🏼👏🏼 . So here’s a little reminder to ensure you’re staying properly fuelled for work and study too ~ not just exercise!! Your productivity, concentration, focus, memory, mood and problem solving skills will definitely thank you for it🤓 . Some BRAIN FOOD ideas: ✅Ensure you have regular meals and snacks, and stay hydrated. ✅Aim for a good balance of complex carbs, protein + healthy fats in meals. ✅Prepare some delish desk snacks, such as rice cakes with nut butter + banana, yoghurt with muesli/fruit, fresh fruit with nuts, or a wholesome homemade baked good💛
user_7;user_750.jpg;You all know just how much I LOVE Bircher muesli (how Swiss of me💁🏼‍♀️🇨🇭)...so of course I have to share my own Bircher mix with you. . I love this one because it turns out a little different each time and is super versatile. My current go-to snack is soaking the mix in my #vegan Greek yoghurt for a few hours to make a thick, creamy Bircher🤤🤤 With fresh fruit, nut butter, buckinis...whatever floats your boat👏🏼💛 . The RECIPE is up on my blog now ~ link in the bio!!✨
user_7;user_751.jpg;Fries have been on repeat this week👏🏼 and I’m definitely not complaining! East, filling, nutritious and absolutely delicious. . If you’ve been avoiding regular potatoes and thinking you have to eat sweet potatoes as they are the ‘better’ choice, here’s some news for you: they aren’t! They really are both just as great as each other ~ a source of complex carbs, high in fibre and various vitamins + minerals. The ‘better’ choice is what goes best in that recipe and what you feel like🙂🙌🏼 . Served my fries with a creamy ‘cheesy’ cashew queso dip, sautéed veg + spicy tempeh. Yum. . CHEEZY CASHEW QUESO 100g cashew yoghurt/cream cheese (you want to choose a thick one!) 2 healed tbsp nutritional yeast 1 tsp garlic powder Pinch of paprika 1 tsp Dijon mustard Salt and pepper, to taste . . 👉🏼blend all ingredients until super smooth + serve as a sauce or dip💛
user_7;user_752.jpg;You know you’re #HEALTH when even your oats are green💁🏼‍♀️🌱 just kidding. But I did add some matcha powder to my oats this morning and it turned them a very pretty shade of green🙌🏼 . Speaking of superfood powders: matcha, maca, açai, camu camu, spirulina and the like...do you need them? Absolutely NOT! . They aren’t magical. They probably won’t make much of a difference to your health and they are usually very expensive. ✅Sure they ARE high in antioxidants and various other nutrients...but so are your regular old whole plant foods 😉 . Moral of the story: If you want and enjoy these superfoods, go for your life! But if you’re watching your budget or aren’t particularly keen, they are definitely not necessary💛💛 . 👉🏼Matcha vanilla porridge with chopped apple, raspberries, choc sauce + @sneaky_wholefoods cookie dough bar from @betterbeingsteph ✨
user_7;user_753.jpg;CHOC CHESTNUT FUDGE BROWNIE LOAF🤯🙌🏼 Anyone else a true chestnut (aka ‘marroni’ for all my fellow Swiss pals🇨🇭) lover like me?? . This was a total spur of the moment creation when I had some roasted chestnuts in the fridge that I thought I could turn into something delish!🌝 . I LOVE the nutty, slightly sweet flavour of chestnuts and they also add moistness and depth to this loaf cake. My description doesn’t even do it justice ~ just try it and thank me later👏🏼♥️ . Big shoutout to that choc hazelnut frosting I got aaall over my kitchen bench when trying to shoot photos for this post, but that’s the reality of food blogging and well worth it🤫 . The RECIPE is up on my blog ~ link is in my bio!!✨
user_7;user_754.jpg;WHY I no longer share ‘what I eat in a day’🤚🏼 . It’s very popular on Instagram and YouTube, there’s no doubt. It gets a lot (like a LOT a lot) of likes and engagement. You might convince yourself it’s ‘helpful’ and ‘inspiring’ to see what exactly others eat in a day...but is it really? . No. It’s not. . It’s irrelevant to you. Period. . Our needs are all so so different and unique. Constantly seeing and comparing to exactly what other people are eating in a day not only doesn’t apply to you, but it leaves you confused, questioning your own choices and needs, and probably feeling bad about them. . When I was sick and in recovery, I would obsess about these full days of eating and compare them to everything I put in my mouth. I would literally take notes and add what the people I looked up to ate into calorie counting apps. I thought it was ‘motivating’ and ‘reassuring’ ~ but heck it wasn’t. Needing to see others eating certain amounts to justify eating to YOUR needs is so disordered and unhealthy. It feeds comparison, insecurity and eating disorders. It hinders recovery and having a healthy relationship with food and your body. . You don’t need to eat the same as me (or anyone else!) to be healthy. . You need to eat for YOUR needs. Your unique situation, body, goals and preferences. . Take pride in honouring YOUR body and eating for YOUR needs, not someone else’s🙏🏼 . If you need inspiration for meal and snack ideas, I hope the posts and recipes on my feed and in my stories can give you plenty of that! But not on what to eat in a day. . If that is something you would like and do need help with, as always I’m more than happy to work together and give you proper nutritional guidance for your unique needs. Send me an email or DM for consult enquiries ♥️

user_7;user_758.jpg;FAIRY BREAD BLISS BALLS🌸 I had some leftover 100’s and 1000’s (aka sprinkles😂) in my cupboard, so I thought I’d create a fun little snack recipe to brighten up these quarantine days👏🏼👏🏼 . NOTE: These actually taste like cake batter!! And make a really great snack to boost energy levels and give you a bit of childhood fairy bread nostalgia 🧚‍♀️🧁✨ . Packed with plant protein and good quality complex carbs, these make a great pre- or post-training snack too. Super versatile and easy to make, there’s NOTHING not to love!🤩💓 . Find the RECIPE up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio!!
user_7;user_759.jpg;TRAINING FASTED🤚🏼 should I or shouldn’t I train fasted?? . Probably one of my most frequently asked questions, so a post is worthy!! . At the end of the day, of course it’s your choice whether or not you decide to eat before training. BUT I think it’s really important to recognise whether or not that choice is serving you, or holding you back🤔 . Except for specific situations, like endurance athletes doing specific sessions with a ‘train low’ focus, there are really no benefits to training fasted. You won’t lose more weight or burn more fat overall (if that is your goal). There MAY likely be performance and health detriments. . Training in a fasted state means your body has less carbohydrate fuel available which = not being able to attain + maintain the same intensities, so you aren’t reaching your fullest potential. . It also can spike cortisol levels. This is a big problem for females struggling with keeping a regular cycle, as increased cortisol means reproductive hormones come second and can lead to hypothalamic amenorrhea or inability to regain a period. This increase in cortisol may even hinder weight loss, if that’s the goal! . Yes eating before training may not be super enjoyable and convenient BUT if you’re putting all that effort + commitment into your training, you should make sure you’re putting the same effort into fuelling your body properly🙌🏼⚡️⚡️ . It doesn’t have to be a full breakfast if it’s early in the morning, try having: ✅a smoothie/shake with banana or oat milk and protein. ✅a couple of energy balls. ✅a piece of toast with banana/nut butter/jam. . Then fuel up with a proper breakfast right after! . Your body (and training performance!!) will thank you ♥️
user_7;user_760.jpg;Snack #LIFE 🙌🏼😋 a quick break between nutrition consults for a boost of energy ~ orange marmalade filled banana muffin (recipe a few posts back!) slathered in PB mixed with @macr0mike protein PB + a banana⭐️🍌 . SNACK TIP: Instead of having a little handful of something, not feeling satisfied and them going back for countless more...or eating from the packet standing in your kitchen, treat a snack like a mini meal 🍴 . That means, put your snack in a bowl/plate and actually go and sit down somewhere to eat it mindfully. Bonus points if you put your phone away and don’t scroll whilst eating! Promise you’ll feel SO much more satiated and satisfied that way😌✨🌸
user_7;user_761.jpg;Morning bliss✨ creamy TURMERIC LATTE OATS for second breakfast after training. My absolute favourite way to refuel with a perfect balance of carbs + protein. Oats are just the best meal ever🥺 . Keeping it interesting by trying out some different flavour combos and this one was definitely a winner 🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup @purecocobella coconut water 1/2 cup cashew milk 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein 1 tbsp flaxmeal 1/2 tsp each cinnamon + turmeric . . 1️⃣Add oats, coconut water, milk and spices to a pot and bring to a simmer. 2️⃣Cook stirring until thick and creamy, then stir in flaxmeal and protein. 3️⃣Spoon into a bowl and add your toppings! I have banana, frozen raspberries, berry chia jam + paleo granola💛💛
user_7;user_762.jpg;MEXICAN PULLED JACKFRUIT TACOS 🌮😋 serious yum and perrrfect for Taco Tuesday!! . Jackfruit, despite being a fruit (!!) make a really great plant based meat alternative to use in curries, stews, taco fillings etc. It has a meaty texture + really takes on the flavours of whatever you cook it with🙌🏼 . Just make sure to use the young green tinned stuff, not the syrupy ripe sweet jackfruit that tastes like bubblegum 🤪 And it is very low energy and low protein though, so I like to include another plant based protein source with it!✅🌱 . If you’re keen for the recipe, let me know and I’ll pop it up on the blog💛💛

user_7;user_764.jpg;LESSONS 💭 One thing social distancing has shown me is how much I’ve changed as a person since recovering from my eating disorder. . During my ED, I isolated myself. I spent as much time as I possibly could. I hated other people watching me eat, or not eat. I felt ashamed and embarrassed when people saw me, and spent as much time as I could in my room. . I said no and made excuses for all kinds of social situations because they caused me too much anxiety and I was too exhausted. I thought people were better off without me anyway... . At my worst during school, I spent most of my lunch breaks crying in the bathrooms. If I even made it to school in the first place. . . I neglected friendships and I lost friends, because I pushed people away. I didn’t talk about how I felt or what I was going through, and always pretended I was fine... . I wasn’t fine...I didn’t WANT to be alone. I craved connection. I desperately wanted to go out and join in with others, eat out with friends, laugh, spend time with my sister. But my mind was so focused on food, and I was so depleted and exhausted constantly, that I just couldn’t. I could only hide. . How can you be truly present, connect with others and give to others, if you’re only a ghost of yourself? . Recovery is so much more than gaining weight. Physical recovery is probably the smallest part of it 🌻 . Taking care of yourself by fuelling your body well has such a big impact on not only your physical health but your mental health. Heck, your entire personality and being!!🙌🏼 . If you feel alone, lost and exhausted, just know that things can and will change. I know because I’ve been there, were I could possibly imagine things to EVER be different ~ and yet here we are today, despite social distancing, I feel less alone than I’ve felt in years ♥️ #thoughts #recovery
user_7;user_765.jpg;CHEESY VEGGIE LASAGNE💛🥺 I don’t even know how I came up with this one but I’m glad I did because it was absolutely delicious 🙌🏼 . Covid and not getting to the shops very often has got me being creative with ways of using up all the veggies + leftovers we have in the fridge before they start looking sad😅 I’m pretty basic and repetitive with most of my meals because it’s easy + what I enjoy ~ but also sometimes you just need lasagne 👽 . Inside we have layers of: ‘Cheesy’ pumpkin sauce Sliced zucchini + kohlrabi Sautéed garlicky mushroom and kale mix Homemade gf lasagne sheets @pimp.my.salad hemp Parmesan . Let me know if you’d like the full recipe!! And have a wonderful Saturday ✨🌻
user_7;user_766.jpg;Overnight oats on repeat (forever)😌💛 who’s with me? . Just a really simple Golden Milk inspired combo for this bowl, using @switch_nutrition Vanilla Bean protein to up the plant protein content✅ I especially love this flavour as it tastes great, adds sweetness, is super smooth + creamy and makes for thiccc oats 🙌🏼 my code is NINA10. . You can check out the RECIPE video over on @switch_nutrition IGTV for the full experience 💛💛 . TO MAKE IT you’ll need: Rolled oats Flaxmeal Cashew milk Vanilla bean @switch_nutrition protein Turmeric . . And of course toppings of your choice! I used 👉🏼 #vegan Greek yog, frozen raspberries, banana + mixed seeds.
user_7;user_767.jpg;Who doesn’t love CARROT CAKE?🐰🥕 Because I sure do! In fact, I’d choose carrot cake over chocolate cake ANY day of the week. . This Carrot Apple Loaf Cake with a @macr0mike PB frosting is super easy, moist and delicious one, that’s made entirely of whole foods. But tastes just as good as any legit carrot cake. A REAL winner in my books!🙌🏼💃🏼 . It also happens to be iso-baking friendly, and most definitely iso-snacking friendly ~ my after dinner snack for the week whilst watching Netflix. Got my snacks sorted even before deciding on what to watch (the struggle is real and recommendations are welcome!)🥺🥺 . Find the RECIPE up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio💛💛
user_7;user_768.jpg;MOTIVATION to exercise⭐️ I get asked about this all the time...how do you stay motivated? . For me the answer is simple. I don’t train because I ‘have’ to. I train because I GET to. . Growing up a competitive swimmer and runner, exercise and training has always been a huge part of my life. Something that I loved doing with ALL my heart. Going through an eating disorder took that away from me. I had to stop training and competing for a few years. I literally wasn’t allowed to get out of bed to go to the bathroom by myself anymore because I had neglected my body so much... . I also went through a time where I forced myself to exercise to burn calories and earn my food. It was torture in my head and almost destroyed me. . Regaining the health and strength to be ABLE to exercise changed everything for me. It gave me such an appreciation for what my body does for me + allows me to do. It gave me strength, confidence, release, purpose, joy, and so much more☺️ . So if you’re struggling with motivation to exercise, I encourage you to think about your WHY 💭 . STOP doing things you don’t enjoy. STOP exercising to burn calories, justify eating, look a certain weight or control your weight. It’s not mentally or physically sustainable. . ✅Remember exercise isn’t just crazy HIIT workouts + gym. It’s walks, nature hikes, swimming in the ocean, dancing, skating, skipping, gardening or cleaning the house, yoga, stretching, learning fun new skills (handstand push ups I’m looking at you🙌🏼)... ✅START exercising in ways that make you feel good, that are fun, challenging, exciting and make you feel strong + empowered. ✅START exercising to feel good, feel healthy and strong. ✅START recognising how exercise is only a small piece of the health puzzle, and resting enough + fuelling your body well are just as important. . And most importantly, relax! If you’re not an elite athlete, it doesn’t matter if you take extra rest days when needed, change things up and don’t stick to a perfect ‘routine’!! . As always, be kind to yourself 💛
user_7;user_769.jpg;On the GREEN SMOOTHIE BOWL train again🙌🏼🤩🌱 there’s probably nothing I love more than starting my day with a thick smoothie bowl ~ always leaves me feeling energised + ready to seize the day, and they are great on my blood sugar levels too (contrary to the popular myth that fruit spikes your sugars🤪) . This one consisted of: Frozen banana Frozen apple @pranaon Banana Split plant protein @switch_nutrition Vitality Switch greens powder (code is NINA10💛) Cashew milk . Topped with my homemade Superfood Bircher mix for some extra crunch ~ let me know if you’d like the recipe 🌝🌻
user_7;user_770.jpg;LETTUCE TACOS 🌮🙌🏼✨ SWIPE to see them in action!! A pro tip on how to take any old meal to the next level: Wrap it up in crunchy lettuce leaves!! . So much more fun to eat too ~ am I right or am I right?🤪 . I often hear people talk about lettuce being ‘empty calories’ and that is SO not true. Sure it’s got a high water content, but it also contains fibre, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, vitamins A, C + K, and folate. Stop hating on lettuce✌🏼🌱 . In my ‘lettuce tacos’ I have leftover curried sweet potato lentil patties, roasted zucchini, homemade sauerkraut + a Dijon tahini sauce. Totally easy yet totally gourmet💁🏼‍♀️💛
user_7;user_771.jpg;COOKIE DOUGH FUDGE BROWNIES🤤 because we can’t have an Easter Sunday without a drool worthy chocolate-filled recipe right?💁🏼‍♀️ . These are sooo decadent + fudgy, packed full of plant protein and fibre (which makes for very happy blood sugar levels🙌🏼) and easy to make. My dessert tonight whilst watching the new ‘The Fittest’ film because if that isn’t #balance then I don’t know what is🤪 . RECIPE: 1 pack @macr0mike brownie mix 1 can chickpeas, drained + rinsed 1/2 cup pitted dates, soaked 2 scoops @macr0mike PB cookie dough protein (code is NINA10💛) 2-3 tbsp almond milk 50g dark choc, I used @pana_organic . . 1️⃣Bake brownies according to packet directions, then allow to cool completely. 2️⃣Soak dates in warm water for 15 minutes to soften. 3️⃣To make the cookie dough, blend chickpeas, protein, dates and almond milk until smooth. 4️⃣Spread cookie dough on top of brownie base and top with chopped chocolate. Slice into brownies! ENJOY💓 . I hope you all had a wonderful Sunday and treated yourself to something chocolatey!😋🌷🐰
user_7;user_772.jpg;Self proclaimed snack queen💁🏼‍♀️👑 keeping me fuelled for staying at home. That’s right, you’re still allowed to have snacks (and Easter treats!!) if you don’t leave the house because your body still needs fuel to function properly ‼️ . If you find yourself struggling with snacking/grazing aaaaall day and feeling all over the place though, I definitely recommend aiming for a bit of structure by having proper set meals + snacks instead of just picking at little bits here and there🙏🏼 . . Here’s a winning snack idea 👉🏼👉🏼 pumpernickel/gf bread topped with nut butter mixed with @macr0mike protein, banana slices + date sauce💛
user_7;user_773.jpg;HOT CROSS BUN OATS🐰🌷 swipe for that close up!!🙌🏼 . A spur of the moment creation I made up today and THE perfect breakfast for your Easter weekend ~ these oats literally taste like a warm hot cross bun🤩 Enjoyed this bowl out in the sunshine of my garden after a zoom class with my gym crew and feeling very grateful for those little things that bring some joy to every day💓 give these a try + let me know what you think!! . RECIPE: 1/2 cup oats 1 cup cashew milk Chunk of grated zucchini (optional) 1 tsp pumpkin spice or cinnamon 1 tsp orange zest or extract 1 tbsp flaxmeal 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein (I used @macr0mike ~ code NINA10) Small handful of raisins . . 1️⃣Combine oats, cashew milk, zucchini, spices, orange + raisins in a pot and bring to a simmer. 2️⃣Cook stirring until thick and creamy, then stir in your flax and protein. 3️⃣Spoon into a bowl, then top with a cross made of #vegan yoghurt + any other toppings of your choice! I added some chopped @sneaky_wholefoods x @betterbeingsteph cookie dough bar and it was perfect!! . ENJOY and happy Easter friends💛🐣 . P.S. I just popped the recipe up on the blog too🙏🏼
user_7;user_774.jpg;A reason to LOVE strength training that has nothing to do with fitness or building muscle or looks...it’s benefits on BONE MINERAL DENSITY⭐️🏋🏼‍♂️ . Having strong bones is important for everyone, period. For preventing fractures and osteoporosis later in life, maintaining independence + functional ability as we get older...it literally sets you up for a long healthy + active life☺️💪🏼 . BUT having gone through an eating disorder, underweight and malnourished, for a decade of my life, leading to being diagnosed with osteoporosis at 18...it’s especially important to me. Especially after being told I’d be in a wheelchair by the age of 30 if I didn’t change things stat... . Strength training (together with eating enough + reaching a healthy weight to restore hormone levels💫) is KEY to stopping bone loss + reversing some of that damage done. . I’ve managed to not only stop my bone loss, but actually gain BACK some of that bone density...And not only that, but strength training has brought me confidence + mental strength that I never thought I could have 💛💛 . Exercise is about SO much more than just changing the way your body looks.
user_7;user_775.jpg;LEGUMES✨🌱⚡️ Do they leave you feeling bloated and gassy? Do you avoid them for said reason? . Fun fact: A large part of our digestion of food isn’t done by our own bodies, but by the healthy bacteria that live in our guts (our microbiome🦠). If we don’t eat certain foods regularly, we don’t have the specific bacteria required to break those foods down ~ this can lead to fermentation of these foods, causing gas + bloating!!🤓 . Good news, we can change our microbiome to be able to digest these foods, by simply eating more of them!🙌🏼🙌🏼 . TIPS to minimise those not-so-pleasant side effects: ✅Introduce legumes slowly. I’m talking 1-2 tbsp every few days to start with, then gradually increase over a few weeks to give your microbiome a chance to adjust! ✅Make sure you are rinsing tinned beans and lentils really well to get rid of all the foamy liquid. ✅If you are cooking your legumes from dry, make sure you soak them for 12-24 hours first. ✅If you’re having chickpeas, peel off the outer skin to remove some of that extra fibre! . In my bowl👉🏼 spicy white bean chilli (recipe from my Ebook), with potato, sweet potato, greens + flax soy yog dip😋💛
user_7;user_776.jpg;CHICKPEA VEGGIE OMELETTE🤩🌱🙌🏼Who needs eggs when you have chickpea flour?! A great plant based alternative to eggs that is: ✅Totally pantry-friendly. ✅Packed full of protein and fibre. ✅Will keep you full for hours. ✅Plus it genuinely tastes like an actual omelette!! . This is one of my favourite things to make for a quick lunch at the moment, and so so easy to make too. I’ve been making it at least once a week (if not more🙈). . It would also make a GREAT savoury breakfast, if you’re into that kind of thing! . The RECIPE is now up on the blog ~ link is in my bio 💛💛✨
user_7;user_777.jpg;Cosy mornings😌✨ and I think I’ve officially swapped my staple breakfast from overnights oats to steaming porridge ~ anyone else?🙌🏼 . I’ve also figured out the best way to make my oats. Just saying. . . ORANGE VANILLA PORRIDGE 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 cup cashew milk 2 tsp orange zest, thinly sliced 1 tbsp flaxmeal 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein (I used @pranaon code NINA10) . 👉🏼Add oats, milk and orange zest to a pot and bring to simmer. Cook stirring until thick and creamy. Stir in protein and flaxmeal, and whisk well to get it nice and fluffy. Spoon into a bowl + add your toppings! ENJOY💛💛
user_7;user_778.jpg;CHICKPEA NUGGETS on repeat🙌🏼😋 it makes me so happy to see so many of you trying (and loving!) my chickpea nuggets...definitely my most popular recipe to date! . They are such a great, healthy and totally plant based alternative to chicken nuggets, that the whole family is guaranteed to love🥰 And actually really fun to make! I love putting them in my nourish bowls, or in a wrap. And I usually make a double for some easy meal prep for the week🕺🏼🕺🏼 . Today’s lunch bowl was leftover chickpea nuggets, baked pumpkin, zucchini + eggplant, fresh greens + a creamy tahini dressing💛 . The RECIPE is on my blog and I also have an IGTV video to show you how to make them ~ check it out!!🌱🐣
user_7;user_779.jpg;ORANGE MARMALADE FILLED BANANA MUFFINS💛🤩 swipe for that close up!! . Quarantine has definitely boosted my baking creativity and I honestly wasn’t sure if these were going to work out ~ but somehow they work perfectly🙌🏼🧁 . Slather them up with peanut butter and you have yourself a winning afternoon snack for all your self isolation needs🥺 Baking also happens to be one of my favourite things to do when I’m stressed, bored or in a bad mood! . RECIPE: 1 cup buckwheat or oat flour 1/2 cup almond flour 1.5 tsp baking powder 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tbsp stevia or sugar of choice 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 2 mashed ripe bananas 1 cup almond milk 1/2 cup orange marmalade (I used homemade) . 1️⃣Preheat oven time 180°C and prepare a 6 hole muffin tray. 2️⃣Combine flours, cinnamon, sweetener and baking powder. 3️⃣In a separate bowl, combine almond milk, vinegar, mashed banana and vanilla. 4️⃣Combine wet and dry ingredients. 5️⃣Spoon batter to half fill all the muffin holes, then spoon one tbsp marmalade into each hole. 6️⃣Top with remaining batter, then bake for 30 minutes or until golden. Allow to cool before removing from tin. ENJOY💛💛
user_7;user_780.jpg;OVERWHELMED. I know that’s how many of you are feeling right now.♥️ . Not only the anxiety from all the changes in routine and normality, the uncertainty, possible jobs lost and fear of everything that’s happening + could happen...but the added overwhelm of feeling like you aren’t doing enough right now when you’re stuck at home🥺 . REMEMBER: Whilst your Instagram stories may be flooded with people’s endless home workouts all day, and all the productive things they got up to ~ this is because these are the instagram-able things!!! The things people WANT to share (often with good intentions, but it isn’t their entire day. Remember).🤞🏼 . This is NOT a competition of who can achieve the most or get the fittest. . You do not have to be productive all the time. . You are allowed to rest. To watch a movie. To read a book instead of start some project or side hustle. . You don’t have to have a crazy at-home workout routine + do HIIT workouts in your house if it’s not right for you. You can go for a walk, stretch or do some yoga. . Exercise, and keeping busy to distract yourself, can be amazing both for physical and mental health, we all know that. But sometimes it’s the opposite...sometimes what our bodies and minds need is a break. Resting. Just breathing and getting through the day. . . You are allowed to (and SHOULD!) unfollow any accounts who make you feel guilty, bad about yourself + like you aren’t doing enough. . Be brave enough to stand up for what serves you best. Be strong in taking care of your physical AND mental health during this time. . Social distance yourself from all of the toxic content on social media that drags you down💁🏼‍♀️
user_7;user_781.jpg;Another day, another YOGI BOWL✨🧘🏼‍♀️ today it’s really kind of a Bircher muesli bowl I guess...was a winner both for taste + keeping me fuelled through an afternoon of writing nutrition plans to send to lovely clients🥰 . Apart from the obvious reason I love Bircher (taste duh), soaking the muesli mix in yoghurt for a few hours also: ✅improves the digestibility of the oats, nuts + seeds significantly! ✅increases the protein content. ✅boosts the calcium, just make sure your plant yogurt/milk is calcium fortified😉 . TO MAKE IT👉🏼 soak your favourite muesli (I used @bobsredmill tropical gf muesli) in #vegan yoghurt for a few hours. Top with fresh fruit + a blob of nut butter💛
user_7;user_782.jpg;FRIES AND FALAFEL?🤔 definitely my kinda fast food🙌🏼🌱 . My whole family is plant based, which means we go through a looot of canned beans each week. And since we’re trying to limit grocery shopping to one trip a week + can only buy 2 tins each shop, the solution = cooking our beans from scratch🤗 . It’s also a lot cheaper, and produces less waste so definitely a win-win situation (just a little more effort, but make big batches and freeze them to save time☝🏼). . Out of the massive batch of chickpeas I made these falafel, creamy homemade hummus + a few other things!💛 . HUMMUS RECIPE: 1 cup cooked chickpeas 2 tbsp tahini Juice of half a lemon 2 cloves of garlic 1 tsp ground cumin 1/2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp salt . . 1️⃣Add all ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until super smooth, with as much cold water as needed to get it really creamy + your desired thickness! 2️⃣Season with salt and pepper. 3️⃣That’s it! ENJOY😋
user_7;user_783.jpg;Still getting in those GREEENS🌱🌝🙌🏼 what about you? . First of all, I don’t want any of you to feel stressed about maybe eating a bit less green stuff atm ~ YES it’s really important to keep nourishing your body with all the good stuff to keep strong + healthy, but we do the best with what we can and have access to right now💛🙏🏼 . A great way to sneak in some extra greens is adding them to a delish SMOOTHIE 👉🏼 ✅You can add frozen spinach, kale or zucchini. They last for ages! ✅Add all those greens in your fridge that are starting to look a bit sad so they don’t go to waste. ✅Try a greens powder! Totally not essential but they can be a good way of boosting your greens intake in times like this. My personal recommendations are @switch_nutrition Vitality Switch, @macr0mike greens + @pranaon Super Greens (code NINA10 for all)🌿⚡️ . Anyways, this very green smoothie was frozen mango, frozen banana, hemp seeds, greens powder, vanilla plant protein + cashew milk ✨
user_7;user_784.jpg;CHICKPEA VEGGIE OMELETTE🙌🏼🌱 What lunches look like when you can’t leave the house to get groceries!! . Thought I’d share some staples that I’ve stocked up on to ensure I have enough food at home so I only need to go to the shops once a week to stock up on some fresh stuff🙏🏼 Friendly REMINDER though: only buy what you need. No one likes finding empty shelves when they go shopping due to all the food hoarders🤪 . IN THE PANTRY: ✅Tins of beans, lentils, corn + tomato. ✅Oats + buckwheat. ✅Brown rice, basmati rice, millet. ✅Pulse pasta + rice noodles. ✅Dried beans + lentils. ✅A bunch of dried herbs, spices and condiments like vinegar, nutritional yeast. ✅Rice cakes, weetbix, muesli. ✅Chickpea flour + buckwheat flour. ✅Dates and dried fruit. ✅Nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, walnuts, chia + flax etc.). . FREEZER: ✅A couple bags frozen veg. ✅Frozen spinach. ✅Frozen peas + corn. ✅Frozen fruit for smoothies (banana, berries + mango). . The beauty of this is it encourages us to be a little more creative with making delicious meals from these staples ~ a great skill to have for the rest of your life if you ask me🙋🏼‍♀️💛💛
user_7;user_785.jpg;Love me a good stack of #vegan PB & J PANCAKES🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️ this combo is out of this world I tell you!! . My usual buckwheat protein pancakes, expect a peanut butter spiked version, layered with fresh strawberries, strawberry compote, banana + PB yoghurt, plus a sprinkle of walnuts. We have complex carbs, healthy fats, plant protein and veggies ~ what more could you want in a breakfast (for yet another day spent at home)?✨👌🏼 . I used @switch_nutrition Protein Switch in PB Toffee flavour... I love the smoothness and texture that is perfect for making a killer stack of pancakes🌻 my code is NINA10 for a lil discount💛 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup buckwheat flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 1/2 small zucchini, finely grated 2 tbsp @switch_nutrition PB Toffee Protein Switch Your choice of plant milk . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients with enough milk to make a thick batter. 2️⃣Heat a non-stick pan and spoon 2 tbsp on for each pancake. Once firm, flip + cook other side until golden. 3️⃣Layer with banana + strawberries and top with strawb compote, PB yogurt and walnuts. ENJOY😋💫
user_7;user_786.jpg;The NOURISH & FIT PROJECT♥️ is here!! With all the stress + anxiety that being stuck at home brings, I’ve been thinking of a way to support more of you through this difficult time ~ with your food, mindset, health, fitness and just taking good care of yourself🙏🏼🌱 .

We are SO EXCITED about this, and can’t wait to see you there. IN THIS TOGETHER 💛💛💛 . The link to sign up is in my bio!!
user_7;user_787.jpg;The KEY to never (and I mean never🤪) getting sick of oats for breakfast is switching up your toppings🙌🏼 . If you need some ideas for variety, try this delicious NUT BRITTLE ~ inspired by sesame snaps, a childhood fave of mine👅 It’s crunchy, nutty + the perfect mix of sweet and salty! . . RECIPE: 50g buckwheat 25g chopped peanuts 25g sunflower seeds 20g dry roasted chickpeas 50g tahini date sauce (found in Woolworths, ingredients are just dates, tahini + sea salt🤞🏼) . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients until well coated. 2️⃣Spread about 1/2 cm thick on a piece of baking paper. 3️⃣Dehydrate for 12 hours until crisp! I have a @froothie dehydrator which I am totally obsessed with experimenting with at the moment. My code NINA10 will give you a little discount if you’re thinking about investing in one😇 . Also, totally not just limited to oatmeal topping 👉🏼👉🏼 makes a great snack too!! What are your favourite oat toppings right now??
user_7;user_788.jpg;Another YOGI BOWL🧘🏼‍♀️✨ SWIPE for some Insta vs #reality because we need a whole lot more of that on here🙌🏼 . Anyway, my first time trying out the @purecocobella Active coco yoghurt pouches so I thought I’d do a little review: ✅First things first, they are CALCIUM FORTIFIED. Actually a miracle. The only #vegan yoghurt in Australia I’ve found so far that is!! ✅Creamy smooth texture. Not runny which I love. ✅A subtle taste of mango, not too sweet at all. They’re very low in sugar actually! ✅Awesome for on the go. . As you can tell, I am a fan😇 afternoon snacking today was the mango @purecocobella yog with my plant protein mousse, banana + dried mango. Try it✌🏼💛
user_7;user_789.jpg;A smoothie a day keeps the doctor away...kinda😅 but they ARE packed full of wholesome nutrients, easy on the digestion + very delicious indeed👏🏼✨ . This is a real simple PB BANANA THICKSHAKE that I am making on the daily at the moment💛 . 1 1/2 frozen bananas 1 scoop plant protein( I used @macr0mike PB cheesecake) 1 tbsp @mayversfood peanut butter 1 medjool date 1/2 cup fortified cashew milk . Blend it all up until super smooth + creamy, spoon into a jar and eat!🥰
user_7;user_790.jpg;Should you EAT LESS if you’re stuck inside and doing less activity?😬 Well actually, not really. . Of course if you’re an athlete who usually trains a few hours a day and now doesn’t, your overall carbohydrate + energy requirements will be lower...BUT for the average person (which is most of us!), doing a little less designated exercise doesn’t actually make much of a difference in terms of what our bodies need fuel wise⚡️🌱 . The MAJORITY of our energy requirements are simply from being alive. Functioning properly and moving around in our daily lives. Thinking, cooking, cleaning, reading, taking showers...ALL of these things still require energy!! . Remember that exercise is something that we should be doing for joy, health and fun ~ not to maintain a certain weight or justify eating a certain amount of type of food. Perhaps, being forced to take a break from going to the gym is that little push you need to realise this🙏🏼 . And if you need help, support + guidance around eating during this challenging time, don’t hesitate to reach out and we’ll schedule a Skype consult (from the comfort + safety of your own home!!)💛💛 . P.S. Lentil falafel, a bunch of veg + marina sauce with noodles for dinner tonight. Always a good idea, exercise or not!✌🏼
user_7;user_791.jpg;DONUT time🤪🍩✨ a Maple Cinnamon Carrot Cake donut topped with thiccc peanut butter frosting + a sprinkle of crushed peanuts. Very good I tell you🙌🏼 . I often hear people referring to foods like donuts as ‘cheat meals’. I hate that. What does that say about your relationship with food and the kind of diet you eat, if you need to ‘cheat’ on it? Doesn’t sound healthy, or sustainable, or like its right for you, to me. How about choosing foods because they serve you in some way ~ maybe they nourish your body with high quality energy + nutrients. Maybe they taste amazing. Maybe they satisfy your hunger. Maybe they are fun to enjoy with friends or experience a culture, tradition etc. None of those things are cheating on yourself🤷🏼‍♀️ . Anyways, back to the donut which most definitely wasn’t a cheat meal! . TO MAKE IT: 1️⃣Make 1 pack of @macr0mike Maple Cinnamon donut mix according to packet directions (my code is NINA10✨), stirring 1 grated carrot into the mix. 2️⃣Bake! Then allow to cool completely. 3️⃣To make the frosting, mix 1/4 cup @macr0mike PB with 1/4 cup normal PB and as much water or almond milk as needed to get a thick frosting. 4️⃣Spread on donuts, sprinkle with crushed peanuts + enjoy!🕺🏼💛
user_7;user_792.jpg;NO fresh fruit on hand? NO PROBLEM🙋🏼‍♀️ if this Corona craze has left you with no fresh fruit at home and no means to stock up on more, I have got your back for breakfast/snack ideas✨🍓 . FACT: Frozen and tinned fruit and veggies are really great alternatives to fresh ones when you don’t have any or are time poor. They’re also super budget friendly!!🙌🏼 . Now, onto the food. GINGERBREAD-SPICED WEETBIX PORRIDGE!✨ . To make it 👉🏼 1️⃣Crush your desired amount of weetbix + add cinnamon, ground ginger, a little ground cloves + cardamom. I also like to add 1 tbsp @pranaon vanilla plant protein, but this is optional! 2️⃣Then add homemade #vegan yoghurt (it’s made from long life soy milk so 100% pantry friendly, recipe on the blog) OR plant milk of choice to get a thick mush #yum 🤪 3️⃣Pop it in the freezer for an hour. You don’t have to do this but it’s really good! 4️⃣Top with frozen fruit or tinned fruit + a dollop of jam, nut butter, whatever you like and have at home. ENJOY♥️♥️ . BONUS TIP: Freeze extra overripe fruit that would otherwise go off to use for situations like this (and all the smoothies!!)👏🏼
user_7;user_793.jpg;#vegan TUNO SALAD🙌🏼😋 who else loves a good open faced sandwich? . And who would have thought that jackfruit (a fruit!!) makes such a great plant based alternative to tuna?🐠 . I promised you guys I’d step up my posting game on my blog again, so I’m holding myself true to that promise👏🏼 Being stuck at home is the perfect time to branch out and try a new recipe you’ve never made before ~ so give this one a try + prepare to be very impressed💁🏼‍♀️ Just a few serving suggestions for your Tuno Salad: In sandwiches or wraps, piled on crackers or crusty bread, served in lettuce cups or a nourish bowl🌱⭐️ . The RECIPE is up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio!!💛💛
user_7;user_794.jpg;ANXIETY around not being able to stick to your usual routine. Not being able to go to work/school. Having plans cancelled. Not being able to go to the gym. The unknown... . I know just how many of you are struggling with this right now and I want you to know that: 1. You are SO not alone. 2. Your struggles and feelings are valid. 3. This too shall pass. Sure it’s not ideal + not fun, but it’s temporary. Nothing bad is going to happen to you from missing the gym for a few weeks. Promise! . Here are a few ideas of ways to spend your time at home✨🏠 . 👉🏼Read a book. 👉🏼Watch a new (or old fave) series/movie on Netflix. 👉🏼Start an arty project ~ how about a vision board, scrapbook, bullet journal, crochet, knitting... 👉🏼Bake up a storm! You know all those saved recipe posts...actually make some! 👉🏼FaceTime, call or text a friend or family member. 👉🏼Have an at home day spa day. 👉🏼Declutter your room, get rid of stuff you don’t need anymore. 👉🏼Do an at home yoga/Pilates/HIIT workout from YouTube. 👉🏼Bring out the old board games (my top pick is Taboo or Scattergories)!! . And remember, if staying at home all day is making you feel very anxious, this may be a blessing in disguise in helping overcome the compulsion to move/workout/be productive all the time. Sometimes what brings us the most discomfort is exactly what will help us grow the most🌻 It’s going to be okay. ♥️
user_7;user_795.jpg;Time to share some CORONA-FRIENDLY MEALS🙌🏼🥰 In a time where so many of us are stuck in self isolation, it can be a little anxiety provoking on what to cook that’s still nutritious + filling, with a lack of access to fresh produce. . Well lucky us, many of those pantry staples + frozen veg not only last for ages, but are also packed full of goodness AND can make a delish meal👌🏼 . Starting with these Tofu + Veg Green Curry Noodles ✨🍜 . WHAT YOU’LL NEED: Frozen veg of your choice An onion #vegan green curry paste Coconut milk Firm tofu (this lasts for ages in the fridge!) Rice noodles (I used brown rice vermicelli) Tamari or soy sauce . . RECIPE: 1️⃣Chop up your tofu + onion, then sauté in a pan with a spoonful of curry paste until fragrant + golden. 2️⃣Pour boiling water over noodles and leave to soak for 10 minutes. 3️⃣Add veggies into pan and sauté for 5 more minutes, then add your coconut milk, noodles + soy sauce/tamari to taste. You can also add some extra frozen spinach. 4️⃣Once all heated through, serve!! 👅 . TIP: No tofu? Swap it for a can of chickpeas instead!!✅ .

user_7;user_796.jpg;LOADED sweet potato boat😛😛✨ SWIPE for that close up!! Who else is a fan? . You might think this is an odd combination ~ but honestly, don’t knock it til you’ve tried it. There’s a reason they’re called ‘sweet’ potatoes after all💁🏼‍♀️ . ✅Such a great wholesome snack or breakfast, loaded with fibre + complex carbs for long lasting energy. ✅Cooking and then cooling the sweet potato develops resistant starch, which is great for #guthealth . ✅Just another excuse to get creative with toppings🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 1️⃣Grab one cooked sweet potato from the fridge (I like to make a batch in advance!) + slice in half. 2️⃣Layer on your plate and load on all them toppings. . . I have: Banana @macr0mike protein PB @mindfulfoods Eros granola A heap of cinnamon (post photo!) . What toppings would you add?🤪
user_7;user_797.jpg;Let’s talk PROTEIN⭐️ Meeting your protein needs is important to aid muscle tissue growth + repair to help your body make those positive adaptations to your training. Protein also helps to keep you feeling full and satiated, + plays many other roles in the body⚡️💪🏼 . Protein requirements for strength athletes are approx 1.6-2.2g per kg of your body weight per day (that’s a little higher than the general population!). You want to be spreading your protein intake throughout the day in at least 3-4 doses to help optimise recovery + muscle growth. So that’s an aim of 20-40g protein per meal!✨🌱 . What does 20g protein look like? ✅125g firm tofu or tempeh ✅1 cup cooked beans, lentils or chickpeas ✅40g dry weight TVP ✅1 scoop protein powder ✅100g dry weight pulse/chickpea pasta . . But remember, foods like whole grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice, buckwheat...), green veggies, nuts and seeds, soy milk, nutritional yeast + more all contain some protein too, so will add to those amounts + contribute to your meal/daily total too🙌🏼👏🏼
user_7;user_798.jpg;Want to know the secret to feeling motivated in the mornings?🙊 THIS👆🏼👆🏼 a real good breakfast bowl! . . Bowls details >> Overnight Cinnamon Vanilla Brown Rice Porridge (literally just leftover brown rice mixed with @macr0mike vanilla plant protein, cinnamon, flaxmeal + cashew milk🍚🌱) topped with banana, soy yog + @mindfulfoods granola✨ . Keeps me full + energised for hours!😁💛
user_7;user_799.jpg;PERCEPTION☝🏼🤯 I’m literally laughing as I post this because never in a million years would I have posted such ‘unflattering’ photos of myself even a year ago...buuut hey I just want to show you how deceiving our eyes can be!! . See the difference between the two photos: 1️⃣Stomach is round and distended. 2️⃣Stomach is flat as can be. . NOT a 12 week transformation, diet, skinny tea...literally the difference between breathing in and breathing out. Normal, human, healthy, ESSENTIAL and about 1 second difference‼️ . Next time you’re comparing yourself to a photo of someone else on social media, please remember: 1. Angles make a massive difference. 2. Lighting, posing, editing all do too. 3. People choose to post photos of themselves that they like. Obviously! Would you post a photo you don’t like of yourself?🤪 4. We are always our own worst critics. . . This is why looks are really so not important. If I couldn’t push my stomach out like that, I couldn’t brace my core to keep my chest up and I would totally fail my squat. My mind often critiques what I look like in training videos, but honestly, feeling strong, having lots of energy and getting to lift heavy things + do what I love is SO much more important than a flat stomach. To me anyway, that’s for sure 🌝 . Be kind to yourself. xx
user_7;user_7100.jpg;COVID-19 aka. CORONAVIRUS🦠🤚🏼 everyone is talking about it, and you’re probably feeling a little overwhelmed with it all ~ and what to believe in terms of what you can do to best prevent catching it, or lessening it’s severity🤷🏼‍♀️ . FIRST things first: There’s no magical superfoods or supplements to boost your immune system quickly❌ The most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus is staying away from areas/people with it + crowded places in general, and practicing personal hygiene (washing your hands often and properly, covering your coughs + sneezes etc.)🙏🏼 . NEXT up is supporting your body’s immune system, and note this is built up over time rather than overnight: ✅Getting enough sleep is really one of the most important things! ✅Staying hydrated with plenty of water, or herbal teas if you like💦 ✅Reducing your alcohol intake. ✅Just eating lots of nutrient-dense and antioxidant rich whole foods like fruits and veggies. No special expensive superfoods needed, variety is key!🍑🍉🥑🍓🥒🥬 ✅Eating enough food overall. Undereating suppresses your immune function big time. ✅Moving your body but also getting enough rest to recover from your training (overtraining also suppresses your immunity big time). ✅Reducing stress as best as you can🧘🏼‍♀️ . And some extra BONUS TIPS: 👉🏼Zinc, iron and vitamin C are some nutrients of special mention for immunity. Whole grains, nuts and seeds, legumes, leafy greens + fresh fruit are great sources ~ or if you’re low in these, a supplement (under the guidance of a health professional!) 👉🏼UP your intake of foods with antimicrobial + antiviral such as fresh herbs, herbal teas, spices, onion, garlic, turmeric + ginger. Hello extra flavour!!🙌🏼 👉🏼Regularly include probiotic foods like sauerkraut + yoghurt, as well as plenty of prebiotic rich foods (onion, garlic, oats, legumes etc) to support good gut health. . Remember, food is NOT medicine and the most important thing is still washing your hands!!🤓 BUT both food + lifestyle play an important role in supporting your body to function it’s best and be it’s strongest when fighting off those bugs!!🌈✨ . I hope this post is helpful and you’re all staying safe!
user_7;user_7101.jpg;Oh hey there😏✨ in case you didn’t realise, I LOVE making smoothies when it’s hot. SWIPE to see the texture smoothies should be💁🏼‍♀️ . Here’s why: ✅Hot weather usually means my appetite just about disappears. Smoothies are a great way to get in a good amount of energy + nutrients!! ✅The high water content of fruit + coconut water/plant milk means smoothies are great to rehydrate and refresh. ✅Packed full of fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. You can even sneaky veggies into them. Try fresh greens or steamed frozen zucchinj, cauli, pumpkin or sweet potato🤞🏼 ✅Quick + easy. Just blend! ✅There are endless different combos to try out so you never get bored and you can adapt them to your needs, preferences + what you’ve got at home. ✅DELISH!! . This combo 👉🏼👉🏼 frozen banana, frozen raspberries, frozen zucchini, cashew milk, hemp seeds + @macr0mike PB protein powder. Super yum😋💛
user_7;user_7102.jpg;Yogi bowl✨😌 SWIPE for that close up!🙌🏼 Just wanted to share with you one of my absolute favourite snacks at the moment, for any time of the day. It’s high in plant protein✅, packed with calcium, omega 3s + other micronutrient✅, and high in soluble fibre for all that good #guthealth ✅ . You can pretty much mix’n match the ingredients to suit what you feel like and have on hand, but here’s what’s in this bowl: . 👉🏼 @mindfulfoods Birchia mix soaked in homemade #vegan Greek yogurt (recipe from my blog, it’s unbeatable tell you🥺) 👉🏼 @pranaon banana split plant protein mixed with water to make a creamy mousse ~ my code is NINA10 ✨ 👉🏼chopped banana 👉🏼 @loving_earth caramelised buckinis for some crunch .

user_7;user_7103.jpg;MIDDLE EASTERN-INSPIRED BOWL of goodness😌👏🏼✨ for a all my fellow falafel fans! . I actually made this lunch for #vegan Dad who is recovering from major surgery at the moment and under full time care to get back to his old self 🥺♥️ Just wanted to take this time to emphasise just how important nutrition is when recovering from surgery or injuries ~ your body is doing So. Much. Work (!!) to heal, repair and recover. . . Yes, you might be laying in bed or sitting down the majority of the day and not doing your usual exercise, but the last thing you want to be doing is restricting your food and under-eating🙅🏼‍♀️ . We want to give our bodies the best building blocks for recovery + maintaining lean tissue, with a focus on: ✅Adequate protein intake (needs may be slightly increased!). ✅Staying well hydrated. ✅All the nutrient-packed fruit and veg. ✅Anti-inflammatory foods, such as extra garlic, ginger, berries, chia, hemp + flaxseeds, turmeric + other spices. ✅Plenty of Plant food diversity + prebiotic rich foods, like oats, beans, lentils + garlic, if you’ve been on antibiotics to rebuild that microbiome! . Anyway, back to the food 👉🏼👉🏼 falafel, spiced lentil dip, homemade roti, sauerkraut + a heap of fresh salad✨🌱🌱
user_7;user_7104.jpg;To all my gals, HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMENS DAY⭐️ I'm so endlessly thankful for all the beautiful, strong women in my life, who lift me up, push me to step out of my comfort zone and be a better version of myself + inspire me in so many different ways. . . To any woman reading this, here’s some totally cliché but also totally true reminders: You are worthy. You are whole as you are. You get to write the rules. The way you look is the least important thing about you. You do not need to shrink or change yourself for anyone else. You are so much stronger and smarter than you think.

Let's support + empower each other, and be damn PROUD of each other's (and our own!) achievements🙌🏼 Embrace our individuality and help each other grow and flourish🌸 . I’ve tagged (just a few of) the women who inspire me on a daily basis, now it’s your turn ~ Tag a woman who inspires YOU! 👑 #internationalwomensday
user_7;user_7105.jpg;BLUEBERRY CARAMEL FUDGE BLONDIES😋✨✨ a plant protein packed slice that tastes too good to be this wholesome!! . Every weekend, I bake some sort of slice, loaf or other baked good to have ready to go for my afternoon snacks that week. Something nutritious + delicious to give me a boost of energy and look forward to in the afternoon is ALWAYS a winner🙌🏼⭐️ . For extra flavour + a boost of essential minerals magnesium and zinc (key for a whole range of functions in the body from muscle recovery + energy production, to bone health + relaxation✅✅) I added some @switch_nutrition Salted Caramel Adrenal Switch.

Allow to cool before slicing! ENJOY🥰🥰
user_7;user_7106.jpg;MYTH: Type 1 diabetes is caused by eating tooo much sugar🍍🍉🍌🍬🍭 . FACT: T1D is an autoimmune disorder. This means the real cause is unknown ~ but basically the body attacks itself by recognising it’s own insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells as pathogens + destroying them⚡️👾 . Therefore a type 1 diabetic doesn’t produce insulin on their own + instead has to inject this hormone which is absolutely ESSENTIAL for life🌿🙏🏼 . So what does this have to do with SUGAR? Insulin is the hormone which allows our muscle + brain cells to take up glucose broken down from the food we eat + use it for energy. Without insulin, this glucose stays in our bloodstream, causing HIGH blood sugar levels⬆️, whilst our cells/tissues/organs aren’t receiving any...leading to muscle wasting, inability to think straight and fatigue. . As you can see, in a diabetic who isn’t receiving insulin OR the correct amount, sugar can absolutely worsen the symptoms just because it isn’t able to be metabolised correctly...BUT sugar plays absolutely no role in the development of type 1!🙌🏼 . And eating too much sugar won’t give you diabetes either😉 . I hope this post was informative and cleared up some myths ~ as always, if you have any questions, leave them below + I’ll do my best to answer💛
user_7;user_7107.jpg;10 MINUTE LUNCH IDEA🙌🏼🌯✨ probably less than that if you’re speedy! But wraps make such great, easy + wholesome lunches, and super fun to eat too let’s face it💁🏼‍♀️ . The details: ✅Homemade wrap made just from lentil + buckwheat flour with water cooked in a non-stick pan ~ but you can use any wrap of your choice! . ✅Veggies of choice ~ I have lettuce, rocket + capsicum. . ✅Leftover bean burger, made from kidney beans, walnuts, onion, flax + a bunch of spices. So yum! . ✅Tahini-Dijon drizzle. . Let me know if you like these simple meal idea posts and you’ll have some more coming your way ~ they’ve been life saving for me these past few weeks balancing work/study/training🙌🏼😂💛
user_7;user_7108.jpg;“I wish I was brave/confident enough to train in a crop top like you...” 🤷🏼‍♀️ TRUTH is, it has absolutely nothing to do with feeling confident about my body. . In fact, quite often I’ll watch back my training videos and catch myself thinking ‘look at your stomach bulging’ or ‘you look so disproportionate’ or something else negative about my body.... . But then I remind myself: Nina, you don’t think like that anymore. QUIT IT!! 🤚🏼🤚🏼 And I remind myself of how much stronger I feel and how much energy I have. How happy training makes me and how much I love getting to move my body, get better at lifting + spend time at the gym with my friends. It’s the best thing ever and I’m not going to let any petty negative thoughts steal that from me. . I don’t train in a crop top because I think I look greater or because I feel confident about it. I train in a crop top because it’s what’s most comfortable. It’s hot, I’m sweaty, in those moments I honestly couldn’t care less about what my body looks like or the fact I don’t have shredded abs or a perfectly flat stomach🙃 . Life is SO much more than that. Our bodies are here for SO much more than just aesthetics. And you don’t have to love the way your body looks to love your body.♥️✨
user_7;user_7109.jpg;Eating for WEIGHT GAIN⭐️ let’s chat. Our bodies don’t really like to change. They like things to stay the same. Homeostasis is the term for it, and our bodies LOVE it. . This is why both losing and gaining weight doesn’t just happen easily without making changes to our habits over a prolonged period of time (that means, not just a few days🤪). . Depending on the types of foods you choose to eat and your appetite levels, eating enough food to promote weight gain is a big challenge. Personally, I can relate all too well!! . Eating bigger portions helps of course, but it’s also really important to take a look at the TYPE of foods you are eating and where they sit on the energy-density scale☝🏼 For example: Eating a huge bowl of steamed veggies or salad sure will fill up your stomach, but it won’t provide many calories. . If you’re trying to gain weight or muscle mass, or just have high energy requirements, it’s SUPER useful to make good use of those more energy dense foods, to avoid constantly feeling uncomfortably full or failing to meet your nutritional needs🙌🏼🌱 . Here I have a relatively small volume but high energy snack of 2 cinnamon raisin bliss balls + a cacao raw bar, with an apple. Swapping the apple to dried fruit would be even less filling! . Don’t fear those high energy foods. If you’re trying to gain or low in appetite/time, they might just become your best friend💛🤗 . ➡️Just a lil disclaimer: These foods do not ‘cause weight gain’, they just make it easier to eat more and meet your calorie needs FOR weight gain. Big difference there!!
user_7;user_7110.jpg;Cosy bowls😌✨🌱 what’s your ultimate comfort food?? . I love a good bowl of Dahl💁🏼‍♀️ in case you aren’t familiar with it (who even are you?!), Dahl is an Indian lentil curry-type dish, basically mushy lentils or split peas that are absolutely packed full of flavour🔥 . Lentils are fabulous for so many reasons: ✅They’re super cheap, especially bought in bulk. ✅They’re high in fibre and prebiotics to feed that good gut bacteria, keep us full + maintain stable blood glucose levels. ✅They’re a great source of plant protein. ✅They’re high in minerals like iron and zinc. . In my bowl👉🏼 curried red lentil Dahl with roasted pumpkin + carrot, greens, a sprinkle of @pimp.my.salad spiced seed mix and a creamy tahini drizzle 😋💛
user_7;user_7111.jpg;How do I overcome FEAR FOODS?🥺💛 I wish I had a magical solution for you, but that’s not reality. . Overcoming fear foods is actually really simple. Fearing a food is a learned belief. We aren’t born with a fear of food, any food! We develop food fears when we hear or tell ourselves that a certain food is ‘bad’ or ‘will do us harm’ again and again and again...and we avoid that food for a long time🤷🏼‍♀️ . The way you overcome this fear is by FACING it. By eating that food. By sitting with that initial anxiety and discomfort. And by doing it not just once, but again and again until it no longer brings up those negative feelings. . You can’t expect to overcome a fear food by continuing to avoid it. Or eating it once and then never again. . I work with clients in overcoming fear foods and ED behaviours all the time. It’s not easy. It requires commitment, determination and a lot of inner work. But oh how rewarding + freeing it is to find a place of peace with food🙌🏼✨ . Remember: Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t ~ you’re right.
user_7;user_7112.jpg;CHOC HAZELNUT SOFT-BAKE COOKIES🤤♥️ basically Nutella cookies. Who else loves this combo? . They’re super soft on the side, with a crisp + crunchy outside, and that melty smooth choc on top. They don’t taste healthy, buuut they are😂😉🌱 . Oh, and I used my ‘lazy-chef’ 3 ingredient cookie recipe to make these ~ the perfect thing to make for snacks when you’re short on time or don’t want to go to much effort!🙌🏼🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 100g buckwheat flour (or swap for oat, wholemeal or spelt) 100g choc plant protein powder, I used @macr0mike 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 1 cup plant milk 50g vegan hazelnut chocolate, I used @picochocolate . 1️⃣Preheat oven roll 180°C and line a tray with baking paper. 2️⃣Combine flour, protein + baking powder, then stir in vinegar and milk to make a thick batter. You may need to add a little more liquid depending on your protein. 3️⃣Spoon into 6 cookies on your baking tray, then top with chopped chocolate. 4️⃣Bake for 12-15 minutes until crisp. ENJOY!!💛💛 . P.S. The sweetness of these will depend on your protein. If your protein isn’t very sweet, just add a few tbsp of stevia or sugar of choice!
user_7;user_7113.jpg;The #TRUTH ~ If you think you can look at someone and tell whether or not they have an eating disorder, you’re wrong. . If you think you can look at what or how much someone is eating and tell whether or not someone has an eating disorder, you’re wrong. . I wasn’t going to make a post for Eating Disorder Awareness Week, but I can’t not...so here I am🌝 The stigma around eating disorders needs to stop. Eating disorders are a serious mental illness. They are not a choice, ‘attention seeking’ or something you can snap out of by ‘just eating’ ... . Eating disorders do not discriminate. Any one of any body size, age, gender and background can struggle with an eating disorder. . And most importantly, eating disorders have NOTHING to do with how much or what someone is eating (or not eating) or how much someone weighs. They have EVERYTHING to do with someone’s thoughts, mindset around and relationship with food + their body. . When you have an eating disorder, your entire life, thoughts and energy are consumed by worries about food, numbers, your body, control, not being good enough...it’s a dark and lonely place. You can feel like you have no hope + things will never change or get better. . But they can. . I know they can because I have been in that horrible dark place where life no longer seemed worthy of living and I was merely an empty shell of the person I used to be. I thought I was a lost cause. I was so consumed by my disorder that I was terrified both of what I was doing to myself, but also of getting better. I was certain I would never change. . But they did. . Reaching out for help, accepting that help + committing myself entirely to changing and getting better was the hardest, scariest + most uncomfortable thing I ever did. Yet, it was also the best. . I’ve spoken to and worked with so many people recovering or ‘recovered’ from EDs. Whilst I believe that recovery is a life-long process that you always keep working on. Not a single one of them has ever said they regret recovery. . It’s always the hardest things in life that are the most rewarding ♥️ . P.S. decided NOT to share a ‘transformation’ photo for the exact reasons I wrote about.
user_7;user_7114.jpg;I like to call this my DECONSTRUCTED SMOOTHIE BOWL😛🙌🏼✨ essentially for those times where you don’t have a blender (or can’t be bothered blending/cleaning your blender) but still want a smoothie bowl💁🏼‍♀️ . RECIPE: I just mixed 2 tbsp of @pranaon banana split plant protein powder ~ which is the bestest flavour, my code is NINA10🌝 ~ with enough cashew milk to make a creamy mousse, and paired that with banana, plum, fresh fig from our tree + a sprinkle of @mindfulfoods Eros granola✨🌸🌱 . P.S. this is a snack haha.
user_7;user_7115.jpg;PASTA lovers where are you at?😋🍝✨ contrary to popular belief, pasta really is not a ‘bad food’ ~ in fact, a whole grain or legume based pasta paired with a veggie-packed sauce is actually a really nutritious, filling + wholesome meal🙌🏼🌱 . There’s so many different varieties of pasta on the market these days, and my top pick are those that are higher in fibre + protein, with a low glycemic index. That means slow release, long lasting energy and satiation⚡️ For #glutenfree 👉🏼 chickpea, edamame, red lentil + pulse pastas, buckwheat, quinoa or brown rice pasta. And otherwise 👉🏼 spelt or good old whole wheat! . I’ve paired my brown rice pasta here with my FAVOURITE protein + flavour-packed Tempeh Bolognese (recipe from my Ebook), greens + cashew cheese👅
user_7;user_7116.jpg;How do you eat your pancakes ~ 1 or 2??😛🥞✨ Apparently today is International PANCAKE DAY, so of course I just have to post a recipe for you all! . These are fluffy choc sea salt protein pancakes made with the new @switch_nutrition Protein Switch (the creaminess + flavour of this one is next level🙌🏼) with creamy choc yogurt, peaches + banana. Highly recommend!! And my code is NINA10 if you want to try it out💛 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup buckwheat flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 1/2 small zucchini, finely grated 2 tbsp @switch_nutrition Choc Sea Salt Protein Switch Your choice of plant milk . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients with enough milk to make a thick batter. 2️⃣Heat a non-stick pan and spoon 2 tbsp on for each pancake. Once firm, flip + cook other side until golden. 3️⃣Top with banana, almonds + peach, and soy yoghurt mixed with a little more cacao/protein. ENJOY😋💫
user_7;user_7117.jpg;You might wonder why I am so passionate about educating others in the importance of FUELLING your body properly + actually eating enough to support your activity levels🤷🏼‍♀️ . Why does it even matter? . Well apart from my own personal experience of unintentionally under-fuelling as a competitive swimmer + almost losing my life (as well as doing significant damage to my health that I’m still working hard to repair now)...we have an abundance of research that shows the consequences of not fuelling your body with ENOUGH of what it needs. . The proper term for it is Relative Energy Deficiency, and yes it’s most common in athletes but this DOESN’T just mean elite athletes, but recreationally active people too! . EFFECTS on the body include: ❌Hypothalamic amenorrhea (irregular or loss of menstrual cycle). ❌Injuries. ❌Impaired performance. ❌Reduced bone density + increased fracture risk. ❌Decreased metabolic rate (as your body tries to conserve energy). ❌Increased risk of cardiovascular/heart problems. ❌Digestive problems. ❌Micronutrient deficiencies. . You see now what a significant impact this has on both short term + long term health, wellbeing and performance? This is why it’s so important to ensure adequate energy intake, even if it’s challenging. Eating enough (and potentially gaining some healthy weight in some cases) is the one and only way to treat + prevent these symptoms🙏🏼 . If you think you may be showing these signs or are struggling with fuelling your body with what it needs to thrive, don’t hesitate to seek professional help from a nutritionist or dietitian. That’s what we’re here for!!♥️♥️ . As always, to book a consult just send me an email via my website or at hellojanina@outlook.com 💫🏋🏼‍♀️
user_7;user_7118.jpg;Just a friendly little reminder that you deserve (and NEED) to eat today💛🌿 ⭐️If you didn’t workout or do any exercise. ⭐️If you ate a lot yesterday. ⭐️If you ate a lot today. ⭐️If you gained weight. ⭐️If you don’t know exactly what or how much is in your food. ⭐️If you’re going out tonight. ⭐️If you feel like you don’t ‘deserve’ to. Which is a false belief by the way. . . You do NOT have to do anything to earn, deserve or ‘work for’ your food. Your body needs food regardless of what you’re doing or not doing today, or what you did yesterday. . Would you ever not feed your dog because you didn’t take him on a walk today?🤷🏼‍♀️ . Fact is, roughly 60% of our daily energy needs go to simply staying alive + functioning properly (which you’d need even if you did nothing but lie in bed and watch Netflix the whole entire day!)🙈 . You gotta nourish to flourish!✨
user_7;user_7119.jpg;CHOC COOKIE DOUGH SLICE ~ who wants a bite? ✨🍪 .

user_7;user_7120.jpg;What are some baby steps you can take to improve your RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD?💫💛 . 1️⃣Stop labelling foods as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Food is food. Sure some a more nutritious than others, but they don’t have a moral value! . 2️⃣Work at building diversity in your food choices, rather than eating the same things every day (or at the same times!). . 3️⃣Focus on eating mindfully. Sit down at the table and take a moment to feel gratitude for the food that’s about to nourish your body! Chew your food + focus on those different tastes and textures😌 . 4️⃣Eat regular meals and try to tune in to your body cues, cravings and food preferences. What works for YOU? . 5️⃣Take a big step back from any comparisons and external factors (like social media, influencers, magazines, diet books etc) that tell you what and how much you ‘should’ eat or leave you feeling confused or bad about your food choices. If you genuinely ARE confused and unsure, seek individualised guidance from a qualified professional🙏🏼🌻 . 👉🏼👉🏼In my bowl is the Choc Mudcake smoothie bowl from my Ebook, topped with @mindfulfoods Eros granola + dried mulberries from @lifeforcewholefoods ✨🍓
user_7;user_7121.jpg;Always eating rainbows ~ who’s with me?🙋🏼‍♀️🌈🌱 Here’s a really simple question plant based dinner or lunch idea, that’s balanced, packed with micronutrients + full of aaaall flavour 🙌🏼 Mexican refried beans with baked pumpkin, fresh veg + crunchy roasted seed mix. Give it a try!!✨ . 1️⃣To make the baked pumpkin, chop your pumpkin with the skin on, sprinkle with dried herbs + bake at 200°C for 30 minutes or until soft. 2️⃣For the beans, purée 1/2 tin kidney beans with 1/2 tsp each garlic powder, cumin + coriander, 1/4 tsp smoked paprika and salt + pepper to taste. 3️⃣Chop your veggies. I used baby spinach, rocket, capsicum + cucumber. 4️⃣Throw everything into your bowl + sprinkle with @pimp.my.salad tamari seed mix. YUMM💛💛
user_7;user_7122.jpg;MANGO-NANA BOWL✨mango and banana is the best smoothie bowl combo ever. If you disagree, fight me😆 . Not only for taste, but also for texture + creaminess. Other fruits like berries just tend to make much icier and less satisfying smoothies. PRO TIP: Buy discounted overripe bananas + mangos which you’ll often find at produce shops, markets and ethnic grocers, to freeze and use for smoothies!🙏🏼 . To make it 👉🏼👉🏼 just blend up 1 frozen banana, a big handful of frozen mango, 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein + 1/2 cup @purecocobella coconut water until smooth and creamy. Top with granola and enjoy!💛💛
user_7;user_7123.jpg;DISCIPLINE. Let’s chat🤚🏼 I feel like the word has so much negative connotation around it. And yes it can absolutely be a toxic thing if you aren’t taking care of yourself + are being ‘disciplined’ with things that are actually doing you a DIS-service (think over-exercising, not taking rest days, under eating, ignoring your hunger etc...) but it can also be a really positive thing!🙏🏼 . People always ask me how I stayed motivated to recover, keep eating more and gaining weight even when it was hard, scary, inconvenient + uncomfortable ~ the #TRUTH is not being motivated 24/7 because that’s just plain unrealistic. The reality is discipline. . It’s being so damn committed to my goals of getting healthy and strong, that I keep pushing and doing what I KNOW I need to do even when I don’t ‘feel like it’. Even when it scares the hell out of me. Even when it’s uncomfortable. . Because I know it will be worth it in the long run. And it’s necessary to get to the place I want + achieve what I want. . Discipline can come from a place of SELF CARE too. Be disciplined to taking care of your body, to fuelling yourself properly, staying on top of my diabetes management, to getting enough sleep + rest, to trusting the process and sticking through with it even when it’s hard. . I think this is one of the most underrated ‘secrets’ to achieving anything. And it’s one of the most rewarding things ever. ♥️✨ . . P.S. I don’t have a personal photographer like some insta people, so screenshot from a training video it is. Enjoy the fab quality 😆😆 #reality
user_7;user_7124.jpg;Who else is eating dessert for breakfast??🙋🏼‍♀️🍓 Tastes like it anyway!! SWIPE for a close up♥️ . I made a PB choc edition of my usual creamy, thick overnight oats with @macr0mike protein ~ topped with banana, strawberries + chopped @locolovechocolate 💫 . The perfect way to refuel after training if you ask both my Nutritionist + foodie self🙌🏼 ✅great source of complex carbs to replenish glycogen stores. ✅packed with plant protein for muscle rebuilding + repair. ✅delicious + easy to digest as my appetite generally isn’t high after training. . Happy Monday friends🌝✨
user_7;user_7125.jpg;INTUITIVE EATING🌻✨ whilst I am ALL for listening to your body and eating when you’re hungry, stopping when you’ve had enough ~ I see it so commonly turn into a sort of ‘hunger and fullness diet’ 🤔 . So here are some little reminders: . 1️⃣Questioning, overthinking + overanalysing your hunger cues is NOT being intuitive. It is the exact opposite actually. If you think you’re hungry, you’re hungry so trust your gut ~ it’s not called overthinking analytic eating after all! . 2️⃣If you’re not hungry for reasons such as stress, being sick (me today🤒🤒), exercise etc ~ you still gotta eat!! Your body + brain still needs that fuel and nourishment to function well. Things like the above might throw off your hunger cues, that’s when you need to use your head and do what you KNOW your body needs to be nourished🙏🏼 . 3️⃣It’s also okay and totally normal to eat for reasons other than hunger occasionally (e.g. pleasure, celebrations, just because it looked delicious!). Food is more than just nutrition. . 4️⃣Compensating or ‘making up’ for something you’ve eaten by purposely eating less (restricting) at another meal has nothing to do with eating intuitively. Your body is smart and can handle a little extra food, you don’t need to micromanage anything! . 5️⃣Eating intuitively is NOT always best. Certain situations, for example in recovery from an eating disorder and needing to gain weight, someone in recovery from hypothalamic amenorrhea + many athletes simply wouldn’t get adequate nutrition if they ‘just ate intuitively’. That’s where having a rough meal guide from a qualified nutritionist or dietitian does wonders👏🏼 . To me, eating intuitively is all about working together with and honouring your body. Choosing to eat from a place of self care ✌🏼💛
user_7;user_7126.jpg;CHOC COCONUT FUDGE CAKE Protein Balls 🤩✨ this is what all your chocolate dreams are made of. They actually taste like cake🙌🏼 . A super duper simple, quick snack recipe that packs a protein + micronutrient punch✅ perfect for your next meal prep. I literally always have protein balls in the freezer for snacking needs as well as keeping the fridge at @unit_viii_strength_and_fitness stocked💁🏼‍♀️ .

Not gritty at all either + amazing ingredients🌱🍫 My code is NINA10💛 . RECIPE: 150g pitted dates 1 cup shredded coconut 2 scoops @switch_nutrition Choc Sea Salt Protein Switch 1 heaped tbsp cacao powder Extra shredded coconut, to roll . 1️⃣Soak dates in warm water for 15 minutes to soften, then drain. 2️⃣Add all ingredients to a food processor and blend to form a ‘dough’. If needed, add a splash of water! 3️⃣Roll into golf ball sized balls, then coat in extra coconut. 4️⃣Pop in the fridge or freezer to firm. ENJOY!!
user_7;user_7127.jpg;Ok. It’s been a reeeeal hot minute since I last posted a recipe up on the blog. A few months to be exact🙈 but WE BACK in the game!!🙌🏼 . Starting with these crispy, golden BBQ MUSHROOM BITES ~ for all my fellow mushroom lovers!🍄👅 . My good friend @tessbegg created a recipe for BBQ cauliflower bites a while ago that looked sooo damn good that I thought I just add to try out. Like, right then. So off I went to the supermarket to get myself a cauliflower, only to find they were small, shrivelled and cost half a fortune each. . I had to think quick, so mushies it was!! . A crispy outside and tender, juicy inside, high in protein + packed full of flavour...perfect for salads, nourish bowls like this one, in wraps or tacos, or even just by themselves. Try them for this week’s meal prep!!💁🏼‍♀️ . RECIPE is up on the blog ~ link is in my bio💛💛
user_7;user_7128.jpg;EAT well to perform well⭐️ This is something I had literally known for years and years. I’d heard it over and over again, I knew all the science and evidence behind it...but only the past few months have I really truly FELT what it means🏋🏼‍♀️ . So on that topic let’s clear up some MYTHS: 🌿Eating well does NOT mean restricting your food intake and depriving yourself of certain foods. 🌿It doesn’t mean ignoring your body’s cravings or hunger signals. 🌿It’s also not eating exactly the same ‘safe’ foods day in day out. 🌿Eating well isn’t synonymous to eating low calorie, low fat or diet foods. 🌿Eating well is NOT a diet. . Umm so what IS eating well then, you ask? It’s finding your own version of balance in order to FUEL a strong and healthy body + mind. It’s eating wholesome, REAL food. And most importantly, enough of it. Including foods that make your body feel + function it’s best, and foods that are just good for the soul (you know the ones!)🙏🏼🍫 . In order for my body to perform well, to have strength and energy, I need enough good food to support not only my training, but also my day to day life, metabolism + brain function. . Don’t be fooled that low calorie, zucchini noodle only diets will give you a healthy body + allow you to perform well in sport. You simply can’t run on empty. . Fuel yourself with REAL energy and nutrient-dense foods. And I can guarantee you’ll surprise yourself with how much more strength, energy and motivation you have when your body has what it needs. I’m talking from not only evidence and research but personal experience too💛💪🏼 #foodisfuel #strongnotskinny . P.S. Still feel rather uncomfortable posting these types of photos. My body is so damn far from anything close to ‘perfect’ or the way I’d like it to be, but I am endlessly grateful for everything it does for me, everything it allows me to do and for putting up with me treating it so awfully all those years, and still having my back. Our bodies are pretty amazing if you think about it🥰
user_7;user_7129.jpg;Hands up if you’re a self-confessed nut butter addict?🙈🙋🏼‍♀️✨ my current favourite is @mayversfood Almond Spread ~ just 100% nuts with no added oils or sugars, a jar doesn’t even last a week in our household! . .

user_7;user_7130.jpg;ZERO WASTE meals🌱💛 Did you know that 1/3 of all the food grown/produced ends up in the bin? That’s crazy!🤯 . But there’s so many ways we can make a positive difference to reduce both food waste and packaging + plastic waste through our food choices🙌🏼 most of them will save you money too!! . ✅Store food properly. I love using @theswag.original 100% natural bags to store my veg in the fridge as they keep them fresh, crisp for SO LONG (10+ days) + they retain more nutrients in The Swag rather than having them just lying there, drying out, going limp and soggy. Simply machine-wash The Swag + reuse over and over! . ✅Upcycle leftovers to new meals!! I do this all the time by turning my leftovers from dinner into a delish lunch bowl the next day, just like this bowl of goodness ~ I call it a #LunchUP ⭐️ . ✅Shop at bulk food stores and farmers markets where they have packaging-free options, and bring your own reusable bags to the supermarket♻️ . They’re just little things, but when we all come to together, for the planet they make a big difference 💛💛 . #plasticfree #compostable #wastefree #wasteless #savemoney #toxicfree #ad #sustainable #theswag #zerowaste #reusablebag
user_7;user_7131.jpg;The weekly plant goods✨🌱🌈 What’s one fruit and vegetable you can’t live without? . If I had to pick (seriously hard choice ughh)👉🏼 banana and pumpkin!! . I find it so satisfying to see my shopping trolley filled with fresh colourful produce that I know will provide so many nutrients, vitamins, minerals + LIFE FORCE to my body and cells to thrive😌 . I try to buy seasonal, local and plastic free where I can, but I am by no means perfect. I’m also a firm believer that it’s not about being perfect, but simply doing the best you can and making small positive and sustainable changes where possible ~ both for our own health + that of our planet 🌏💛
user_7;user_7132.jpg;Veggies for breakfast? Don’t mind if I do!!💁🏼‍♀️🌱 I honestly can’t even remember the last time I had a savoury breakfast ~ probably over 5 years ago before I went vegan + used to have eggs on toast or something🙈 . But fear not! There’s still plenty of great ways to get a good serve of veggies in at breakfast even if you’re a sweet breakfast person like me🙌🏼 . VEGGIE-BOOSTERS for sweet breakfasts: . ✅Grate some zucchini or carrot, or add a handful of cauli rice into your oats. You really can’t taste it! . ✅Throw a big handful of greens into your morning smoothie or smoothie bowl. . ✅Add some frozen zucchini, cauliflower, pumpkin or sweet potato into your smoothie. Just adds volume + creaminess with no compromise on taste!! . ✅Make a delicious breakfast bowl like this one with cinnamon baked pumpkin or sweet potato, #vegan yogurt, fruit, chia/flax pudding + nuts. The recipe is up on my blog😋 . ✅Add some grated zucchini or carrot into your pancake batter, makes them super fluffy + moist! . See? Easy as and delicious too!

user_7;user_7135.jpg;PRE-TRAINING FUEL⚡️⚡️ what’s your go-to food before exercise? . I never train fasted anymore these days. Not only is it bad news for female hormones, but also for performance. Giving your body some fuel in the form of easily digestible carbs means ⬆️⬆️ energy, strength, performance + recovery to get a whole lot more out of your training!!🙌🏼 . And if you train super early, even just a banana or some dates make a great snack that’s much better than nothing😇 . My FAVOURITE thing to have pre-training is a smoothie! It’s quick to make, provides a great source of carbs + a little protein, and easy to digest so won’t sit in my stomach + make me feel sick✅✅ .

user_7;user_7139.jpg;You can’t hate yourself healthy. . Health doesn’t come from punishing yourself, starving your body or running yourself to the ground... . You don’t become any healthier by beating yourself up for not being ‘good enough’ or comparing yourself to everyone else. . Healthy is deciding you ARE good enough, and you deserve to honour, respect and take care of your body. Healthy choices come from a place of self compassion, not self hate ♥️🌻
user_7;user_7140.jpg;They say preparation is KEY🔑⚡️and well, they’re totally right! If you leave the house for work or school/uni for the day and haven’t packed any food with you, chances are you won’t be fuelling your body properly...leading to: ❎Not being able to concentrate properly. ❎Lack of energy. ❎Impaired learning + memory. ❎HANGER 👹 ❎Spending money on overpriced food, often that isn’t very nutritious either. . The solution? Just some super simple food prep to have a nourishing lunch and snacks for the day🙌🏼🙌🏼 it might take you an extra 10 minutes the night before to put together, but you’ll thank yourself for it🙈 . Just an example from last week, I packed👉🏼 leftover bean burger with rice + greens for lunch, plus a banana and @macr0mike protein bar 😋💛
user_7;user_7141.jpg;#NOURISH BOWL game going real strong😎 And while we’re at it, let’s talk about CALCIUM🌿🥛💪🏼 . It’s true that on a plant based diet, if not done currently (that is, you aren’t eating enough of the right things) it can be hard to get enough of this essential mineral. Calcium is super important for STRONG and healthy bones + teeth, muscle contractions, cell signalling + more⚡️✨ . But if you eat enough whole plant foods, then meeting your daily needs (around 1000mg) really won’t be a problem for most! . HIGH CALCIUM plant foods include: 💛 Tofu + fortified plant milks. Make sure they are fortified by checking the nutrition panel! 💛 Nuts and seeds (chia, almonds, sesame etc.) 💛 Leafy green veggies like kale + pak choy . 💛 Unhulled tahini . 💛 Blackstrap molasses 💛 Beans + chickpeas 💛 Whole grains like oats and quinoa . . 👉🏼Bowl details: Sweet chilli tofu, brown rice, kidney beans, stir fried broccoli, butter lettuce + homemade cashew Parmesan.

user_7;user_7144.jpg;BODY IMAGE💛 I feel like there’s so much misunderstanding and confusion about what a positive body image is... . Positive body image is not never ever having a negative thought about your body. Because let’s face it, that’s just not realistic🤷🏼‍♀️ . Positive body image is about having an appreciation for your body that is SO much deeper that what it looks like. . It’s loving your body for everything it DOES for you (like keeping you alive!) and everything it allows you to DO on a daily basis ~ like walk and breathe and eat food and think and run and huge friends and travel the world...💫 . It’s deciding that your body is worthy of love, kindness, respect, care and nourishment no matter what it ‘looks’ like. And that the way you look or feel about the way you look doesn’t change your worthiness or who you are as a person. . It’s recognising those negative thoughts about yourself and acknowledging them, but then moving on. Not letting them rule your life. Knowing that you ARE not those negative thoughts, they are simply passing by as visitors. . It’s knowing that having a positive body image doesn’t come from achieving a certain ‘body #goal ‘ or changing your appearance. It comes from within. From changing the way you talk to yourself. . It’s recognising that there are things about your body which aren’t ‘perfect’, but being able to say ‘well I love you anyway’ ♥️ . Thoughts will come and go. Take care of your body anyway.
user_7;user_7145.jpg;VANILLA CARROT ICE-CREAM✌🏼🥕🍦✨ a winning combo that’s for sure ~ don’t judge until you’ve tried it!! . This super quick snack is: ✅High in vitamin C + A, and antioxidants. ✅Packed full of fibre. ✅High in plant protein. ✅A great source of calcium + omega 3s. . To make the ice-cream👉🏼 just blend 1 frozen banana with 1 cooked then frozen carrot, 1 heaped tbsp vanilla plant protein + 1/3 cup cashew milk until smooth. I also added a lil pinch of turmeric✨ . Scoop it into a bowl + serve with soy yogurt mixed with flaxmeal. Super wholesome and refreshing!!🌞💛🐰
user_7;user_7146.jpg;#HEALTH tip: Stop overthinking food✋🏼🌱 Did you know that one of the most harmful + self-sabotaging things people do is overthink nutrition? . TRUTH is, if you aren’t an elite athlete, have very specific performance goals or certain health requirements, then you really don’t need to worry about the super fine details of your diet. And doing so MAY be doing you more harm than good!😅 . I often get asked ‘Is this meal too high in carbs/fat?’, ‘Is this too much of ...?’, or ‘Is this the right grams or balance of ...?’ ~ but what about instead asking yourself: ✅Do I enjoy this food? ✅Does this meal satisfy and energise me? ✅How hungry am I? How does this make me feel? ✅Will this nourish and fuel my body? . What constitutes a healthy diet is eating a wide variety of whole foods that include carbs, proteins + fats, that you enjoy eating and that make you feel good mentally and physically. Stressing over the small things (like whether it’s the exact right balance at every meal or the right combination or too many grams of this or that) WON’T make you any healthier⭐️ . Anxiety around food is not healthy. Relax. Stop overthinking it. Stop worrying about every piece of ‘nutrition advice’ you read on social media and go back to basics. Listen to your body and enjoy your food!🙏🏼 . And if you are concerned or unsure about whether you’re meeting your nutritional needs and eating in a way that supports you best, then get in touch with a qualified nutritionist or dietitian who can help ~ that’s what we’re here for😉💛
user_7;user_7147.jpg;CHOC GINGERBREAD Copycat Clif Bars🤩🍫 Looking for a wholesome, gingerbread spice filled snack that’s definitely not limited to the festive season? Look no further! . These bars were inspired by the very popular Clif bars (I’m sure you’re all familiar with!), but taste even better in my opinion🙌🏼 Packed full of fibre, high quality carbs, healthy fats and plant protein, they’re not only delicious but energising and satisfying. Perfect for taking on the go too! . I am obsessed with all things gingerbread anyway, but the chocolate chunks just take these to the next level💁🏼‍♀️ . The RECIPE is now up on the blog ~ link is in my bio!💛💫
user_7;user_7148.jpg;Getting those GREENS🤩🌱✨ who else is a fan of green smoothie bowls? . A lot of people come to me saying that carbs will instantly make them ‘gain weight’. . I wanted to talk about WHY that is, and WHY it’s really unhelpful to focus on the scale weight for this exact reason☝🏼☝🏼 . When we eat carbohydrates, they are either used for energy, or stores in our muscles and liver as glycogen (glycogen is essentially long chains of carbohydrates, which our bodies can convert back to glucose + use for energy at a later date. Pretty cool hey!!🤪). . Now, glycogen is essentially ‘invisible’. You can’t see it, other than maybe your muscles looking a little more fuller and pumped. Which is a good thing in my opinion!! BUT each molecule of carbohydrate requires around 2-4g of water to store it as glycogen. So your weight on the scales WILL reflect that!! . This is why, when people go on a low carb diet, they might loose 2-3kg in the first week!! This is just glycogen depletion and loss of that water needed to store the glycogen. Soooo essentially you’ve just dehydrated yourself🙄 . Don’t fear carbs. Carbs are simply a macronutrient. A unit of energy. A source of fuel and LIFE FORCE for our bodies and cells to function!! . 👉🏼in my bowl is the Tropical Greens smoothie bowl from my Smoothie Bowl Masterclass Ebook (one of my faves🤤) topped with pepitas + Brazil nuts ~ link to the recipe is in my bio!💛
user_7;user_7149.jpg;CREATIVITY⭐️ we don’t always have time for getting creative with food and trying different + new recipes...in the normal, busy weekly routine, it’s pretty common to stick to the same staple recipes and quick’n easy meals🙈 . And hey, THAT’S OKAY!! . But I do love to get creative in the kitchen + try out some new recipes when I have the time. It’s fun, helps build more connection and appreciation to food, and increases diversity (both great for #guthealth and not getting bored💁🏼‍♀️). . Last week, I tried out a #vegan egg recipe that the lovely @theplantbased_dietitian posted on her feed ~ which was surprisingly easy and VERY realistic with the addition of black salt to give it that ‘eggy taste’😳🐣 Paired with my favourite veggie-packed black bean pasta, lotsa greens + homemade cashew Parmesan🌱 . Have you tried any new recipes lately?💛💛
user_7;user_7150.jpg;EATING WITH DIABETES✨ they say a person with type 1 diabetes has to make an extra 120 decisions a day involved with managing their blood glucose levels ~ and let me tell you, most of them involve food! . Whilst it’s become second nature to me now after 13 years of having diabetes, it’s still forever a learning curve and science experiment, where constant changing + tweaking is needed to keep those blood glucose levels happy🙏🏼 . Here’s some insight into a meal time with diabetes!! . 1️⃣Check blood glucose level via finger prick or CGM. The aim is 4-7 mmol pre meal! . 2️⃣What am I eating? Weigh/measure (or guesstimate) the amount of carbs in my food. Apps such as @cronometer_official make this a million times easier!🙌🏼 . 3️⃣Do the math! Using my insulin:carb ratio (which varies for each person + also my activity levels, time of day and month!) work out how much insulin in need to give myself for the meal. . 4️⃣Make any adjustments required by considering whether my blood glucose is dropping, rising or steady, if I’ve just exercised or will soon, the amount of fibre, protein + fat in the meal, and adding or subtracting a ‘correction factor’ if I’m a little too low or high🙋🏼‍♀️ . 5️⃣Give insulin!! Via an injection or insulin pump. . 6️⃣Now we wait 15-20 minutes for that insulin to take action in the body! In the meantime, finish preparing food to make good use of time😉 . 7️⃣EAT!! . Quite a process when I look back and think about it. But hey, I’m grateful for the patience I’ve learnt having diabetes, and for the technology + medicine available today making it possible for me to still live a healthy and (relatively🙈) normal life!💛
user_7;user_7151.jpg;Zero effort dinners, who else loves them?🙋🏼‍♀️🌱 you know when you’re tired, can’t be bothered cooking and imagination is lacking, but still want/need a nourishing + wholesome meal? . . 👉🏼In my bowl: TOFU RICOTTA (just blended extra firm tofu with garlic powder, onion powder, nutritional yeast, a little Dijon mustard, lemon juice, mixed herbs + salt/pepper) with a bunch of stir fried veggies and sweet potato + pumpkin. Was GOOD😋✨ . . Have you got any favourite simple, next to no effort meals?💓
user_7;user_7152.jpg;SWEET POTAT-OATS😛✨ my newest breakfast creation and a deeelish alternative to oats, to get some more variety (and veggies💁🏼‍♀️) into your morning! . Sweet potatoes are an amazing source of: ✅complex carbs for long lasting energy. ✅fibre for gut health ✅essential vitamins + minerals! . I used the brand new @switch_nutrition Protein Switch (coming very soon!!) to boost the protein content in this porridge ~ which is made from protein for optimal absorption + muscle growth. It’s creamy, smooth and tastes absolutely AMAZING. I do recommend 🙌🏼🙌🏼 my code is NINA10 💛 . RECIPE: 200g riced sweet potato* 1 cup coconut, almond or cashew milk 1 scoop @switch_nutrition vanilla bean Protein Switch 1 tbsp flaxmeal . 1️⃣Add riced sweet potato and milk to a pot, and bring to a simmer. Cool until sweet potato is soft and liquid is absorbed into a thick porridge. 2️⃣Stir in flaxmeal and protein, then spoon into a bowl. 3️⃣Top with your choice of fruit + other toppings! I added fresh mango and banana. ENJOY💛💛 . *you can buy sweet potato ‘rice’ in the freezer section of Coles and Woolies, or just pulse raw sweet potato in a food processor until it resembles rice!!
user_7;user_7153.jpg;First ever weightlifting comp🏋🏼‍♀️✅ and feeling ALL the feels right now. My nerves definitely got the better of me and it seems I completely forgot how to snatch (sorry coach!)🤣 but still very happy with 5/6 lifts + proving to myself over these past few months that I am stronger than the endless voice of doubt in my head. . Blood sugars cooperated relatively nicely too, with a few extra units of insulin to cover the sky high nerves + adrenaline 🙌🏼 . Safe to say: I am hooked and hungry to beat that girl who got on the platform today! . A huge thank you to the legends at @wolfpack_barbell, the amazing @catreilly777 for being the best support crew/camera girl, @kb__pt for all the encouragement, @the_sportsdietitian + of course coach @john_sleeves ♥️♥️♥️ @unit_viii_strength_and_fitness . . P.S. Please excuse the possibly blurriest photos I’ve ever posted. Not #aesthetic but they mean a whole lot to me 🥰 . 📷: @catreilly777
user_7;user_7154.jpg;CHOC HAZELNUT FUDGE CUPS✨🌰👅 Bringing back an old fave!! Basically Nutella cookie dough bites that are so good for you, they’re basically salad. Well, almost😉 . These Choc Hazelnut Fudge Cups make the perfect post-workout snack to refuel the body with the optimal balance of protein to carbs, but also a perfect snack for any other time of the day, because let’s face it: They’re delicious, wholesome + packed of nutrient goodness so why not🙊💫 .

user_7;user_7155.jpg;Hands up all my fellow oat lovers!!🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️ Every good day starts with a big bowl of oats in my opinion. Not only are they cheap, versatile and delicious as a creamy porridge, overnight Bircher, crunchy granola or muesli paired with fruit ~ but they are a real SUPERFOOD💫🌱🙌🏼 . Oats are a great source of: ✅Soluble fibre to promote good gut health + digestion, and maintain stable blood glucose levels. ✅Beta glucans which regulate cholesterol levels and improve cardiovascular health. ✅Complex carbs to provide long lasting energy for the day! ✅Essential minerals, such as iron, zinc, magnesium and manganese, which all play important rolls in helping our cells function. ✅Plant protein, at 11-17% if their energy coming from protein, oats are one of the highest protein grains! . And they make a perfect pre or post workout meal to, for fuelling and recovery🏋🏼‍♀️ If you find you have trouble digesting oats, try soaking them over night and/or choosing quick oats instead of whole rolled ones, to make them easier for your tum to break down😌 . 👉🏼In my bowl are Choc Overnight Oats with @pranaon choc plant protein, topped with cherries, banana stars + hemp seeds⭐️🍒 . P.S. How do you like my arty fun on this post? Yay or nay?🙊
user_7;user_7156.jpg;HEALTH HACK🌱💛💫 maybe a bit of an unconventional one, but one of the things that I found such a game changer for being able to cook wholesome meals with ease + not feel overwhelmed was... . 👉🏼Learning to cook without needing a recipe of any kind! . That’s right. Just opening the fridge, seeing what I have or what I need to use up, and throwing delicious meals, easy together from that. No stress, endless planning and needing to follow complicated recipes needed💁🏼‍♀️ . FOR EXAMPLE: This bowl was just stir fried veggies with garlic + tamari, steamed squash + Japanese sweet potato and pan fried tofu, all topped with a peanut satay sauce + fresh coriander. ✅Quick, a bit random, but packed with goodness and super tasty!!🙌🏼💛
user_7;user_7157.jpg;TREAT YOURSELF✌🏼💗✨ . I’m actually not really a fan of the word ‘treat’ because society has turned it into something needing to be earned or justified, a ‘reward’ or ‘cheat’ meal, something to feel guilty over. I don’t agree with that 👎🏼 . Unless you’ve stolen it (!!) you should never feel guilty for eating any food. Full stop. . Food is SO much more than just nutrition. It’s joy, pleasure, enjoyment, experiences and memories with loved ones. A food isn’t healthy or unhealthy ~ a PERSON is healthy or unhealthy. And eating some less nutritious foods can be a perfectly healthy part of a wholesome and balanced diet🌱🍉🍫 . So treat yourself to something you love! I made my favourite Choc Cookie Dough Slice for dessert and my tastebuds were very happy indeed😋 Let me know if you’d like the recipe!💕
user_7;user_7158.jpg;STRAWBERRY-NANA WHIP⭐️🍓paired with juicy fresh mango makes the perfect pre-workout fuel🙌🏼 . Before training, especially if you’ll be doing anything high intensity where your body is using that anaerobic energy system (think weightlifting, HIIT, CrossFit, powerlifting, sprints...) you are best off having a carb-rich meal or snack⚡️⚡️ . Carbs provide the quick fuel + energy to perform at high intensities and optimise your strength and performance during your workout, which makes a fruit based meal just perfect🤩 . I also like to add a serve of @nakedharvestsupplements pre-workout blend for an extra energy-kick brought to you by caffeine and creatine ~ both have a high level of evidence to support they can improve performance💪🏼 If you do choose supplements, such as pre-workout, make sure it’s a high quality one with clean, tested ingredients and a company that is transparent about their ingredient list. That’s why I LOVE @nakedharvestsupplements 💓✅ If you’d like to give them a try, my code is XONINA for a discount!! . Anyway, to the RECIPE: 1 frozen banana 1 heaped tbsp vanilla plant protein 1 serve @nakedharvestsupplements sweet strawberry pre-workout A splash of coconut/almond milk . . 1️⃣Blend all ingredients until smooth and creamy. 2️⃣Spoon into a bowl + top with chopped mango and hemp seeds. ENJOY!!💛✨
user_7;user_7159.jpg;‘You’re never going to be 100% ready and it’s never going to be just the right time, but that’s the point. It means that every moment is also the right moment. If you want it, you just have to do it.’💫🦋 . This is my mantra right now. I always used to put things off because I was scared that things wouldn’t turn out the way I wanted them to. That all the effort would be for ‘nothing’ or I just didn’t feel ready yet. But whenever I look back, the only things I regret are the things I DIDN’T do, what I didn’t try or didn’t start sooner. . And hey, worst case scenario, if you don’t like the outcome, you can always go back to what you’re doing now. You’ll never know if you don’t give it a try🙏🏼 . 5x5 back squats @ 60kg. We got a LONG road ahead but these legs are finally starting to feel stronger! . @unit_viii_strength_and_fitness
user_7;user_7160.jpg;CARROT CAKE PANCAKES🐰🥞 a way to get your veggies in at breakfast without even realising💁🏼‍♀️ . They’re fluffy, soft and packed with flavour. Plus all of that fibre from the veggies means: ✅Supporting a healthy microbiome for good gut health. ✅Promotes production of short chain fatty acids such as butyrate in the gut, which is associated with a whole range of health benefits, from improved immunity + brain function, to reduced risk chronic disease. ✅Stable release of carbohydrates into the bloodstream for long lasting steady energy levels. ✅Feeling full + satisfied! . . Enough science, let’s get to the goods🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup buckwheat flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 1/2 small zucchini, grated 1 small carrot, grated 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ground ginger 2 tbsp plant based protein powder of your choice (optional but recommend) Your choice of plant milk . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients with enough milk to make a thick batter. 2️⃣Heat a non-stick pan and spoon 2 tbsp on for each pancake. Once firm, flip + cook other side until golden. 3️⃣Top with banana, walnuts + #vegan Greek yogurt mixed with @macr0mike PB! ENJOY😋💫
user_7;user_7161.jpg;Why anyone would ever voluntarily skip breakfast is beyond me?🤷🏼‍♀️😂 Breakfast is the BEST meal of the day. . Breakfast usually also happens to be my pre-training meal, so it plays an important role in providing the fuel + energy for a great session🙌🏼⭐️ . FUN FACT: Studies show that kids who eat breakfast perform better in school than those who don’t, in areas such as concentration, focus, memory, learning and even behaviour!✅ . In case you needed another reason to enjoy a delish breakfast bowl like this! . 👉🏼👉🏼In my bowl: Turmeric latte overnight oats (oats soaked in @purecocobella coconut water + almond milk, vanilla plant protein, turmeric, ground ginger and cinnamon) topped with banana, nectarine, granola mix + soy yog mixed with flaxmeal. SO GOOD 💛💛
user_7;user_7162.jpg;Crispy golden POPCORN TEMPEH BITES💫⭐️😋 in my #Nourish bowl lunch today. Some serious deliciousness🙌🏼 . Together with a friendly REMINDER to grab your Ebook bundle before it’s too late...just a couple of hours to go!! This recipe is from one of the Ebooks in the bundle by @elsas_wholesomelife and it’s a real winner. It’s actually VEGAN KETO book but I obviously added some carbs to the meal💁🏼‍♀️ such great variation for cooking tempeh in a new + delish way!!🌱💪🏼 . I’ve been having way too much fun in the kitchen trying all the new recipes from the 60 different Ebooks (over 2000 recipes in there🤩), and I wholeheartedly recommend you grab yourself this amazing bargain too if you’re looking for food inspo, recipe ideas + a wealth of nutrition info (I cringe at how ‘salesy’ that sounds but I honestly don’t know how else to put it!!🤣😍). . Super grateful to be able to collaborate with such an amazing bunch of foodies to bring this to you💛💛💛 . Link is in my bio!!💫
user_7;user_7163.jpg;Totally in my element💁🏼‍♀️🌱💫 such a key is finding your JOY in food! . Nutrition, the type of foods we choose and how we fuel our bodies are all super important to our health. But food is SO MUCH MORE than just nutrition. It’s a huge part of our lives and takes up so much of our time + energy daily. That’s why having a healthy relationship with food + finding your joy in the food you eat is so IMPORTANT to making it sustainable ~ instead of an exhausting chore🙏🏼 . HOW do you find that joy? ✅Find out what kind of foods + flavours you actually love! No need to force yourself to eat things you don’t enjoy. Try things, experiment, choose what you enjoy! . ✅Utilise herbs + spices!! And salt!! I’m mentioning this because I went through a period where I forced myself to eat bland salt-less food + convinced myself it was fine, but never felt satisfied + lost so much enjoyment. Flavour is KEY!! . ✅Experiment with different recipes and have FUN in the kitchen!! I’ve been trying out lots of different recipes from The Vegan Bundle + it’s been so much FUN!! It’s given me ideas, variety, inspiration + I’ve already found new favourites!! The Bundle is the perfect resource for recipe ideas with over 2000 different plant based recipes of ALL different kinds ~ most really easy, simple, budget-friendly + wholesome too! And better yet you have them all in a convenient library on your phone/kindle🤩🤩 it’s available only ONE more day so make sure you don’t miss out! Link is in my bio or bit.ly/user_7 💛💛 . ✅EAT MINDFULLY! Ok ok I talk about this all the time, but it is a real game changer. Actually taking the time to sit down + enjoy your food without distraction of work, phone, TV etc, chewing your food well and being PRESENT makes such a huge difference in how much you enjoy your food😇 take the time to focus on the different tastes + textures! You’ll feel so much more satisfied, and your digestion will thank you too!! . ✅Make it social! Cook and eat with friends, share food, have a potluck ~ great food is even better with great company, promise🥰 . What’s something that gives YOU joy in food? . 📷: @raemarie_lifestyle
user_7;user_7164.jpg;KINDER MILK SLICE✨👅🍫 Do you remember these? Possibly my #1 childhood favourite treat and also something I really missed when we moved to Australia. The soft-bake rich choc cake-biscuit sandwiching a creamy ‘milk’ filling with just the right mix of sweetness + lightness. I’m getting hungry again just thinking about them😂 . I’m pretty chuffed with how these turned out, they taste exactly the same as I remember ~ and 100% good for you too✔️✔️ Creating wholesome plant based version of old favourites (with no compromise on taste💁🏼‍♀️) brings me SO MUCH JOY and I hope they can bring the same to you! I’m always up for a new challenge so if you have any requests, send them my way!!🙌🏼 . The RECIPE for these is in my Nourish Me Ebook that’s part of The Vegan Bundle for just 2 more days, so make sure to grab it along with the 59 other incredible jam-packed Ebooks whilst you still can AND go into the draw to win an individualised Nutrition Plan from me!! ~ link is in my bio♥️
user_7;user_7165.jpg;Summer means TROPICAL BIRCHER BOWLS for breakfast🌞🌴💦 such a delicious twist on one of my favourite Swiss traditions, I could seriously eat this every single day 🙌🏼 . I soaked my oats overnight in @califiafarms Unsweetened Almond Milk which makes for such a smooth and creamy Bircher, that’s a really great source of plant-based calcium too⚡️ You can find the Califia range in the fridge section of the supermarket, seriously a game-changer for plant-based milks in my opinion😋 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup rolled oats 1 tbsp chia seeds 1 tbsp dried currants 1 cup @califiafarms Unsweetened Almond Milk 1 tsp vanilla extract Fresh mango, banana + coconut flakes, to serve . 1️⃣Combine oats with chia, currants, vanilla and Califia Farms Unsweetened Almond Milk. Stir well and allow to soak in the fridge overnight. 2️⃣In the morning, spoon into a bowl. 3️⃣Top with sliced banana, mango + coconut flakes. ENJOY!!💛💛 . 👉🏼Using this as a post-training meal? You can also up the protein content by stirring in 1-2 tbsp of vanilla plant based protein powder! . #califiafarmsau #plantbased #plantbasedmilk #veganuary
user_7;user_7166.jpg;What are you favourite TOAST TOPPINGS?😋🌱🍞 indecisive me can never choose between sweet or savoury ~ so I choose both!🙋🏼‍♀️ . I topped two slices of my super soft + crusty Best Ever Gluten Free Bread with: ⭐️Mashed avo + gf vegemite ⭐️Peanut butter, banana + cinnamon . You can find the bread recipe in my Ebook, which is also part of the EPIC Vegan Bundle of 60 different recipe, health + plant based nutrition related Ebooks🤩 It’s only available for a few more days, so head to the link in my bio or go to bit.ly/user_7 !💓💓☺️
user_7;user_7167.jpg;Praying for our country and all those affected by the horrors♥️ Whilst I usually post about nutrition and health and food related things...sometimes things happen that make that seem almost insignificant... . Australia is in flames. It’s estimated around 6 million hectares of land have been burnt, 500 million animals killed, thousands of homes burnt down, people stranded and evacuated, entire towns reduced to ashes, and at least 20 lives lost😔 . The smoke is causing breathing difficulties for not only those in the area, but as far as New Zealand 2000km away. . It’s easy to feel helpless in situations like this. But together as a community we are strong. By raising awareness, reaching out to those in need and giving what we can to help the emergency services, rescued wildlife and people affected, we can make a difference. Little acts of kindness go a long way🌻 . To do my part where I can, I’ve teamed up with some amazing ladies @jordanhartley @sheridanskyefit @betterbeingsteph @jennanne @kylielgilbert I’m lucky to call my friends to offer you our health, fitness + recipe Ebooks to purchase together. The Bushfires Fundraising Bundle is $40 AUD and contains 10 Ebooks (including my new Smoothie Bowl Masterclass Ebook💫), with 100% OF PROCEEDS going directly to @nswrfs and @cfavic ~ link is in my bio♥️ . OTHER WAYS you can help are donating directly to these organisations such as @wireswildliferescue @redcrossau @balubluefoundation @portmacquariekoalahospital (even a few dollars helps!), donating food/blankets/clothes, and spreading awareness by sharing this post on your own social media. A little goes a long way! . . Sending love and strength to all those affected ~ let’s keep fighting♥️♥️♥️ . Bushfire images via @stephclairesmith
user_7;user_7168.jpg;My ROCK BOTTOM. A question I get asked all the time about my long past with an eating disorder is ‘What made you change?’🦋✨ . #truth is, there was never a single moment or thing. There were many rock bottoms. Many falls. Many wins followed by relapses...but in the end, it was the realisation that: No one was coming to save me. This was MY responsibility. . I didn’t choose this illness. But I CAN choose recovery. This part is up to me and me only. I needed face reality and what I am doing to my body, and take those scary, brave steps to change🙏🏼 . One thing that made the most impact was being told I had the bones of an 80 year old woman. At just 18. I was diagnosed with osteoporosis + told that if I didn’t change, I would be in a wheel chair by the time I was 30. All as a result of not having a period. . I thought I was being ‘healthy’ by eating so little. That is NOT healthy. Our female reproductive hormones are SO important for our health, especially for regulating bone metabolism to build + maintain strong bones 🦴💪🏼 . Not eating enough, overexercising + too low body fat means our bodies don’t produce enough of these hormones, resulting in loss of a period. It’s like a warning cry from your body! . And I see this all too often in other girls/women♥️ . HOW TO GET YOUR PERIOD BACK: ✅Nourish + fuel your body! This is the number one most important step, as your body needs to be able to produce those hormones + know it’s ‘safe’. I recommend working with a qualified nutritionist or dietitian to ensure you are fuelling your body properly + help you get to a truly healthy place, both physically + mentally! If you’d like to work together, consult bookings for February are now open💫 . I understand not everyone is in a position to work with a professional, thankfully my beautiful friend @thisgirlaudra wrote the ‘Get Your Period’ Handbook which goes through all the steps in getting a healthy period back. It’s filled with a WEALTH of knowledge + actionable steps, + has my nutritionist tick of approval!!♥️ . AND it’s part of The Vegan Bundle, as well as the ‘Keep Your Period’ handbook. This week only, you can get them all 60 Ebooks for the price of 1-2 ~ link in my bio!!🥰
user_7;user_7169.jpg;VEGANUARY🌱💛 this month, to kick off 2020, it’s a great time to make some positive changes to your diet to include more plant foods🙌🏼 . Eating a plant based diet is not only amazing for our own personal health, but one of the most effective changes we as individuals can make to benefit our planet. Something very relevant at the moment🌎💫🙏🏼 . I’m not about unsustainable fad diets or restrictive eating. That’s why I approach plant based diets with a mindset of ABUNDANCE, finding JOY in food + creating healthy, sustainable habits to swap/include more plants!!☺️ . 1️⃣Why not commit to trying a fully plant based diet for this month as a little experiment. Give it a try + see how you feel!! . . 2️⃣The Vegan Bundle is the perfect resource for loads of plant based recipes, food inspiration, nutrition information to educate yourself, meal prep + vegan transitioning guides and SO much more. You get 60 vegan Ebooks to keep forever, for a massive 96% discount ~ but it’s only available for THIS WEEK so don’t miss out!! Link is in my bio 🥰 . 3️⃣If going fully plant based is too overwhelming or not possible for you at the moment, why not try to do Meatless Monday’s, have one fully plant based day a week, or try doing only vegan breakfasts for this month? . 4️⃣Or even just use this month to get into experimenting with MORE plant based foods and recipes!!🤩 Swap your dairy milk for almond, soy, oat or cashew milk, try a veggie burger and bake some delish vegan banana bread? . Any positive change is AMAZING. Take it at a pace that feels right for you, and if you need any support or guidance along the way, I am always more than happy to help!💛💛 . P.S. For snacks this week I baked these amazing Choc Baked Oatmeal Bars from @runningonrealfood which is in one of the Vegan Bundle Ebooks! SO MUCH YUM👅💫
user_7;user_7170.jpg;New Year’s DETOX🌱⭐️ since we’re not only starting a new year, but a whole new decade ~ I thought I’d share with you some of my favourite ways to detox! And better yet, all of them are 100% Nutritionist-approved, so you’re guaranteed to get results🙌🏼 . 1️⃣Go to the toilet. Whether you choose a number one or number two is up to you, both are super effective!💩 . 2️⃣Exhale deep and slow. Or just breathe normally. Both do the job just great! 🌬 . . 3️⃣Embrace the sweat! Just make sure you wash daily or there may be unpleasant side effects👃🏼 . Repeat on the daily until you’re fully detoxed!! . JUST KIDDING you can’t stop. Your body naturally will continue these methods of elimination for the rest of your life because it’s a normal physiological function of your liver and kidneys, together with your elimination organs (GI tract, skin + lungs) to detoxify any toxic metabolites and other unwanted things🤓 . Forget restrictive, unsustainable and expensive detox fads, diets, cleanses and supplements. Just focus on the basics of taking care of that precious body with plenty of wholesome food, staying hydrated, moving daily, getting enough sleep + rest🌱💛💫

user_7;user_7172.jpg;Ending 2019 with a REFLECTION✨🌝 and a reminder that you are capable of so much more than you think you are ~ you just have to BELIEVE in yourself. . Yeah right. I know that sounds soo cliche, but I can tell you from my own experience (and from what I’ve seen in the hundreds of individual clients I’ve worked with the past 18 months of being a Nutritionist), it’s the truth. YOU CAN. . No matter how dark, how far away, how impossible and incredibly difficult things feel for you right now. If you know your WHY, and what you’re fighting for, and combine that with: 💛Consistency and patience. 💛Hard work and effort. 💛Self belief and self compassion. 💛A great support system (you don’t have to do this alone!). Then you will get to that better place and you will move closer towards your goals. And not only work on achieving those goals, but actually enjoying the process too. Because THAT’S where all the growth + magic happens🌱🌻✨ . I’m still SO far from where I want to be as an athlete. More days than not I get frustrated and disappointed and impatient with myself that I’m not strong or fast or good enough yet...but then (mainly thanks to my AMAZING coach, mentor, friends, role models + support crew) I’m reminded of the things above. Learning to acknowledge and be proud of the progress I HAVE made instead of only focusing on that which I haven’t achieved yet. And in the end: Good things take time. . So my biggest intention for 2020 is finding that BALANCE between pushing myself to work hard + being kinder to myself. Because really, they go hand in hand😌🏋🏼‍♀️♥️
user_7;user_7173.jpg;PROAT PUDDING ~ just a breakfast I am loving at the moment😋✨💪🏼🌱 I personally love adding a plant based protein powder to my oats in the morning because it: ✅Boosts the protein content to help me meet my relatively high protein + calorie needs at the moment. ✅Adds the best texture, fluffiness and flavour to my oats to make them THAT much more delicious🙌🏼 . It’s not essential to supplement with protein powder though, just depends on your individual needs + personal preference 😇 The KEY though is finding a really good plant based protein. Many are gritty and grainy, too sweet, or taste like dirt👎🏼 I have a few brands I use + love, but for this recipe I’m obsessed with the new @pranaon Plant Protein formula as it’s by FAR the smoothest, creamiest, almost silky and pudding-like protein. With flavour, sweetness + ingredients no point too👌🏼 . TO MAKE IT: 1️⃣Cover 1/2 cup oats with boiling water and soak overnight. 2️⃣In the morning, add 2 tbsp @pranaon Banana Split plant protein to a bowl and mix with enough water or milk to make a pudding/mousse. 3️⃣Stir oats and protein mousse together. 4️⃣Spoon into a bowl + top with banana, nectarine, soy yoghurt, chopped nuts and I also added some @stdalfouraustralia mango pineapple jam for good measure🤪 . ENJOY friends!💛💫
user_7;user_7174.jpg;QUASI-RECOVERY. Who’s familiar with this term?🤭 Personally, I was stuck their for a really long time but couldn’t admit it to myself. I knew I wasn’t happy, I wasn’t healthy, I wasn’t free from my demons...yet I was much ‘better’ than I’d been in the past so therefore I was fine, right?🤷🏼‍♀️ WRONG. I wasn’t fine. . . 🔸You’re eating more, but still tied to rules and restrictions around amounts or types of foods. 🔸You stick to your familiar and safe foods, anything else brings you anxiety and guilt. 🔸You ‘allow’ yourself things but need to stick to a strict exercise routine + often compensate with extra exercise. 🔸You tell yourself you’re fine because you’ve been worse and there are people much ‘sicker’ than you. 🔸Rest days bring you anxiety, eating out brings you anxiety, anything unplanned brings you anxiety. 🔸You still have to track or weigh or measure or count everything. 🔸Your mind is still largely focused on food. 🔸You would not be okay with gaining weight and are still consumed by this fear. . You didn’t come this far to only come this far!! . Don’t settle for kind of better. You deserve TRULY better. If this post resonates with you, I’d love to work together and help you reach that TRULY healthy place. Get in touch via email or my website 💛💛🥰
user_7;user_7175.jpg;A or B? How do you eat your food?🤪💫🍜 I used to eat all the components of my meals separately and keep everything neat + tidy in the bowl, but I’ve found mixing everything into a messy mush to be so much more delicious and satisfying🌝 A little less #instaworthy perhaps though💁🏼‍♀️ . Here’s a typical super simple lunch/dinner of Satay Tofu Noodles, just: ✳️Stir fried broccoli, carrot, spring onion + capsicum. ✳️Brown rice vermicelli. ✳️Pan fried firm tofu until golden and crispy. ✳️Satay sauce made with @mayversfood PB, sweet chilli sauce, tamari, garlic powder + ground ginger. . . And all topped with a giant handful of fresh coriander🙌🏼🌱 Happy weekend fam💛
user_7;user_7176.jpg;SALTED CARAMEL Bliss Balls💫😋 such a simple recipe but it’s just soo good. I just LOVE making big batches of bliss balls to keep in the freezer for wholesome + energising snacks to grab during the week🙌🏼 . Often bliss balls are made with nuts, but I usually use oats as a base ingredient just because they are SO much cheaper! Instead I add different nuts for flavour, variety and some extra healthy fats. Win win💁🏼‍♀️ . I also added my favourite @switch_nutrition Salted Caramel Adrenal Switch for some extra salty caramel flavour goodness plus a big boost of magnesium to help aid muscle recovery + make these balls the perfect snack for post-training⚡️⚡️ My code is NINA10 💛 . RECIPE: 1 cup pitted dates 1 cup rolled oats 1 scoop vanilla plant protein (or 1/4 cup almond meal) 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tbsp cashew butter 2 serves @switch_nutrition Salted Caramel Adrenal Switch Pinch of salt . . 1️⃣Soak dates in warm water for 10 minutes to soften, then drain. 2️⃣Add all ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until a dough forms. 3️⃣Roll into golf ball sized balls and pop in the fridge or freezer to firm. ENJOY!!💫💫
user_7;user_7177.jpg;GUILT-FREE is not a description for food. Period. . Guilt is not an ingredient and it’s not anything you’ll find in any food. Guilt is a feeling. . . You can remove all the sugar, or fat, or calories, or JOY from a food (remember: the PURPOSE of food is to provide us with energy and nutrients, so isn’t removing all of these things kinda beside the entire point of eating?🤷🏼‍♀️). That guilt is in your mind, not in the food. . To make a food ‘guilt-free’ you simply have to CHOOSE to rid your mind of those thoughts and feelings that you should be feeling guilt for eating, because it doesn’t serve you in any way other than weigh you down🙏🏼🌱💛 . Ft. Today’s very green ‘Green Goddess’ smoothie bowl. Recipe is from my Ebook and it’s a real goodie ~ link is in my bio!🥰
user_7;user_7178.jpg;Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas Day, filled with love, light and lots of special moments🎄💫♥️ I know this time of the year there’s a whole lot of talk about how to avoid the Christmas ‘blow out’ or how many hours you have to exercise to burn off X food you eat today...and I want to repeat the following message for those who need to hear it today✋🏼 . First of all, it’s Christmas. It’s one day. ENJOY it and stop overthinking and being a Grinch to yourself! . Enjoying yourself and eating a bit more than you usually do, and some special Christmas foods doesn’t mean you have to go crazy and eat to the point that you feel sick + uncomfortable. . ✅Ditch the restriction but also ditch the ‘all or nothing mindset’.. ✅Give yourself permission to enjoy the foods you want. Be present and eat mindfully!. ✅Listen to your body. If you feel full or genuinely don’t want something, you are allowed to say no, or save it for later when you actually do want to have some!. ✅Don’t try to compensate for it tomorrow by skipping meals or forcing yourself to do extra exercise. This only leads to a very unhealthy relationship with food + exercise. Your body is smart and can handle a day or two of a little extra food!!. ✅Be kind to yourself. Stop overanalysing and try to find your happy balance😌⚡️⚡️ . Especially at times of the year like this, food is SO MUCH MORE than just nutrition. It’s also pleasure and enjoyment, fun, memories and experiences with loved ones. Think about the best Christmas memories you have...I bet they aren’t that you ‘ate perfectly’ and said no to all the amazing food🙊 . So please re-evaluate your thoughts towards food this Christmas...you don’t need to justify your choices or feel guilty for eating anything (unless you stole it🤭). . ENJOY the beautiful food, enjoy the moment, and move on. You deserve it.
user_7;user_7179.jpg;EAT MORE PLANTS✌🏼🌱💛 something that we can all do and all benefit from (including helping our planet!) as in this day and age, eating more plant based meals has never been easier, more accessible + more delicious!😋 . Forget the all or nothing approach, you don’t have to be fully vegan or vegetarian right now to make a positive difference, even just having one more additional plant based meal is a fantastic change ✅ . I love all the different options now available from @woolworths_au, @colessupermarkets and @futurefarmanz across Australia, such as these deeelish #gardein crispy tenders! They have an abundance of options to suit all tastes, from fish-less fillets to plant based burgers🙌🏼 . In this Nourish bowl we have roasted zucchini + sweet potato, lots of greens, chunky tomato sauce, Gardein tenders + a dollop of tahini🥰 . #futurefarmco#coles#woolworths#vegan#sustainability#meatfree#plantforward#ad#plantbasedlife#poweredbyplants#makethechange#environment#plantpower#vegetarian#flexitarian#plantbased
user_7;user_7180.jpg;MANGO CHEESECAKE BIRCHER bowl✨🍑 that’s packed with plant protein + tastes like summer. The perfect wholesome post-workout meal to refuel, replenish and repair🙌🏼 . If you’ve been watching my stories, you’ll know I’ve been hooked on Bircher muesli lately. It’s such a simple, energising and delicious meal that you can pack a whole lot of nourishment into (complex carbs from oats, antioxidant and fibre rich fruit, healthy fats from seeds + calcium and protein from soy yoghurt🌱)⚡️ For a post-workout meal, I love adding @nakedharvestsupplements Thrive Protein to boost the protein up to 30g to optimise muscle recovery, plus it adds the most amazing Mango Cheesecake flavour that goes perfect with Bircher🤩 . I love how natural and simple Thrive’s ingredients are, and the digestive enzymes mean it’s easy on the tummy too. If you’d like to give it a try, my code is XONINA 💫 . TO MAKE IT: 1️⃣Combine 1/2 cup oats with 100g soy yoghurt, 1/4 cup almond milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract + 1 tsp chia seeds. Mix well and allow to soak overnight. 2️⃣In the morning, combine one scoop @nakedharvestsupplements Mango Cheesecake Thrive Protein with enough water to make a mousse, then stir into your Bircher mix. 3️⃣Spoon into a bowl and top with fruit of your choice (banana, peach, mango are amazing!) and hemp seeds. ENJOY!!💛💛

Don’t forget to tag me if you try them out and let me know in the comments if you have any more snack recipe requests🤗
user_7;user_7182.jpg;Bircher bowls can do no wrong🤩 SWIPE for the #reality of what it actually looks like when I eat it! . Friendly reminder that food doesn’t have to be Instagram worthy or perfectly styled. The purpose of food is to fuel and nourish our bodies, provide us with energy to live our lives + satisfy our cravings. NOT look perfect on a square on your phone. So don’t let your scrolling through ‘perfect’ food photos make you feel bad about your messy Tupperware breakfast or thrown-together lunch. It’s JUST as good♥️ . 👉🏼👉🏼Topped my Bircher with fresh bluebs, nectarine, banana + crunchy @mindfulfoods Eros granola (seriously YUM) from my fave new place @lifeforcewholefoods . Messy perfection🙌🏼💫🌱
user_7;user_7183.jpg;With Christmas around the corner, I know a lot of you experience anxiety over all the festive food, family meals + other celebrations✨🎄 the holiday season can be a stressful time of the year for this reason, so I wanted to share a few REMINDERS: . ⭐️ It’s OKAY to eat foods that may not be considered the ‘healthiest’. Food is so much more than just nutrition. It’s also pleasure, joy, memories + connection with loved ones...and remember that one food or a few meals WON’T make you less healthy. 🌿. . ⭐️ It’s okay and NORMAL to overeat a little sometimes. Again, this won’t make you less healthy or gain weight. In fact your body will just turn up its thermostat for a few hours and burn it off as excess heat! Embrace the food baby, it will pass🙏🏼 . ⭐️ Holidays are about spending time with people you love, relaxing, celebrating, creating memories, sharing...they are SO much more than the food. Life is too short to waste these special days stressing over calories + eating ‘clean’, take it from someone who learnt the hard way💛 . Eat the foods that you’d like. Give yourself permission to truly ENJOY them, be present, and then move on without overthinking and dwelling on it, or feeling the need to compensate for it in some way. . I promise you will be the HEALTHIER person for it💫🥰
user_7;user_7184.jpg;No time? No worries😎 Made myself this wholesome and delicious Buddha Bowl for lunch in less than 15 minutes despite having done zero weekly ‘meal prep’ (while I try to most of the time, I’m human. Sometimes I don’t have the time or really can’t be bothered, and that’s okay too🙈) . And this is a friendly reminder that it’s OKAY to take the short cuts sometimes. . . ✅Don’t have fresh veg? Use frozen! ✅Didn’t prepare snacks? Grab a bar! ✅Forgot to cook rice? Keep some quick cook cups as a back up. . ✅Have no time to make lunch and nothing prepared? Buy something or make a super quick smoothie, sandwich or bowl of oats. ✅My fave tip: When you cook dinner, make extras that you can ‘upcycle’ for lunch the next day. I call this a #LunchUP ✌🏼✌🏼(can we make this a thing?!) . In my bowl I have leftover baked sweet potato, potato + zucchini from last night, some @_herofoods_ tempeh I pan fried with Cajun spice mix, fresh greens, coyo ‘sour cream’ + sweet chilli sauce. Deeeelish!!🍠🌶🌱
user_7;user_7185.jpg;Here’s another festive recipe for you⭐️ CRANBERRY FUDGE BROWNIES🙌🏼😋 rich, gooey, super chocolatey with a juicy burst of tart cranberries. I’m sold! . They’re also packed full of fibre, antioxidants and plant protein to make them not only delicious, but satisfying + nutrient-dense🌱🍫 On that topic, I just want to remind you that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with or ‘bad’ about having the regular, sugar and oil containing versions of Christmas treats. It will NOT ruin your progress. It will NOT make you a bad person or a failure. It will NOT result in anything bad happening at all. I genuinely love creating ‘healthier’ versions of treats that are suitable for people with a range of different dietary requirements to enjoy. I love the challenge, I love the taste, I love the way they make me feel and it does NOT come from a place of deprivation or restriction. The difference is really important🥰 . RECIPE: 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup (60g) oat flour 1/4 cup (40g) cacao powder 1 tsp baking powder 120g choc plant protein, I used @macr0mike (see Notes for swap!) 2 tbsp blackstrap molasses 1 1/2 cups almond milk 1 cup frozen cranberries . . 1️⃣Preheat oven to 180°C and line a tin with baking paper. 2️⃣Blend beans into a purée. 3️⃣Combine dry ingredients, then stir in beans, molasses and almond milk. Gently fold in cranberries and pour into tin. 4️⃣Bake for 45-50 minutes, then remove from oven and allow to cook before slicing. ENJOY💛💛 . 👉🏼For a protein powder swap, up the cacao to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup almond meal instead + 1/2 cup date or maple syrup for sweetness!
user_7;user_7186.jpg;The dreamiest of breakfast bowls😌💫 creamy CARROT CAKE OATS that I cooked in half almond milk, half @purecocobella coconut water. Actually really really delicious and if you’re still cooking your oats in water then you are missing out big time💁🏼‍♀️ . BENEFITS of coconut water: ✅Hydration. The fact that it contains essential electrolytes such as potassium + sodium can actually make it more hydrating than water, as our cells are able to absorb that water more effectively in the presence of electrolytes!💧 ✅Taste. Find a good brand and it’s so refreshing + delish. My personal fave is @purecocobella . ✅A great low sugar alternative to juice or soft drink if you’re sick of water or just want a change! Add some ice cubes, mint leaves or a few raspberries and you have yourself a fancy refresher for summer!🙌🏼 . Are you a coconut water fan? . P.S. Let me know if you like these ‘health benefits of’ posts and if yes, what foods you’d like me to feature next!!🙊💓
user_7;user_7187.jpg;The current situation👌🏼😋 After training sessions, I’m always SO HAPPY that I made sure to make enough dinner for leftovers the next day, and have a delicious + nourishing meal like this waiting for me when I get home💥 And there’s nothing better than refuelling with a big bowl of pasta!! . Speaking of which: SO many of my clients tell me that they won’t have dinner if they get home late, or eat at all after 6 or 7pm...so here’s in ⭐️IMPORTANT REMINDER⭐️ There are no rules for when you can or can’t eat. If you get home late and haven’t eaten, are hungry or have just done a workout, please eat dinner. If you’re still feeling hungry after dinner, eat a snack 💁🏼‍♀️ . Food isn’t suddenly bad for you or will make you gain weight past a certain time of the day! It’s MUCH more detrimental if you aren’t refuelling properly after training/a busy day, or meeting your body nutritional needs, than it is what time of the day you are having your last meal. HONOUR your hunger and fullness. And love your body enough to take good care of it by providing it with what it needs no matter what time of the day it may be🙏🏼 . I’m gonna enjoy my pasta + jackfruit bolognese (let me know if you want me to post the recipe) now. Have a beautiful day!💗
user_7;user_7188.jpg;Sometimes the weight you need to lose isn’t on your body💛🌻 . Sometimes the weight you need to lose is... ☝🏼The weight of other people’s opinions of you and negativity. ☝🏼The weight of the pressure you put on yourself to be ‘perfect’. ☝🏼The weight of the guilt and shame around food choices. ☝🏼The weight of overthinking, questioning + suppressing the signals your body is giving you to eat, rest, take a break... ☝🏼The weight of food rules and restrictions. ☝🏼The weight of forcing yourself to do exercise that you don’t enjoy or don’t have the energy for. ☝🏼The weight of all the criticism and negative self talk you give yourself. ☝🏼The weight of the constant exhaustion from not fuelling yourself properly or giving yourself enough rest. . I can promise you, letting go of the weight of these things WILL make you healthier (and happier too, even if it takes a little honesty, time and inner-work to get there. You are SO not alone)🙏🏼 . And here’s a very smiley, sweaty Nina with a big Choc-Avo Smoothie ~ infinitely happier and healthier than all those years I weighed a lot less than now✌🏼💛
user_7;user_7189.jpg;REINDEERS or CHRISTMAS KOALAS? What do you think?🐨🎄✨ I’ve been seeing these pop up everywhere on my Insta feed so of course just had to make some of these cute little cookies for myself too😌 . TO MAKE THEM: I just used a @macr0mike #vegan cookie mix and decorated them with pretzel antlers + yes I am ‘that’ person who uses raisins, because I didn’t have any choc chips and I actually think raisins are pretty great💁🏼‍♀️ . The perfect festive baking idea for the lazy chef or time poor🙌🏼 . Happy weekend!!💛💛
user_7;user_7190.jpg;PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE BOWL. I know I know, it’s a big call. But this was one of the BEST smoothie bowls I’ve ever had🤩💛 . Super thick. Creamy as. Satisfying and tastes like a spiced cheesecake mousse👅 It also happens to be packed full of protein (a whopping 33g to be exact!!) + calcium, soluble fibre and lots more plant goodness🌱🙌🏼 . And yes I had this for lunch because it was a hot day and it’s exactly what I felt like ~ and whoever made the ‘rules’ about ‘lunch/dinner foods’ and ‘breakfast foods’ is seriously missing out💁🏼‍♀️ . Forget food rules, and make nutrition choices based on what serves you best in that moment!💫 . The recipe is from my Smoothie Bowl Masterclass Ebook, along with 35 other amazing bowls just like it ~ which you can find through the link in my bio💛🥰
user_7;user_7191.jpg;SKILLZ INCLUDE: Throwing as many different plants into a bowl as I can find + calling it lunch😋🌿 And sometimes, it turns out in the best of unexpected combos (which is really handy for rather indecisive people like me🙈)💜 Have you discovered any favourite combos this way?? . THIS BOWL was filled with leftover porcini mushroom quinoa risotto, tofu burgers (recipe from my Ebook), rocket and a bunch of sautéed veg with garlic + coconut aminos. Sounds fancy, actually really easy👌🏼✨ Happy afternoon my friends🌻
user_7;user_7192.jpg;GINGERBREAD PANCAKES💫 quite possibly my favourite stack yet, and the perfect festive breakfast for this special time of the year 😌🎄 . The secret to fluffy, wholesome pancakes is using the right ingredients! I love @califiafarms Unsweetened Almond Milk as my plant-based milk of choice because of its smooth + creamy texture which makes the most delicious pancakes🙌🏼 It’s also fortified with calcium which is a big tick from me & you can grab it from your local supermarket!✅🌱 . RECIPE: 1/2 cup buckwheat flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 2 tbsp vanilla plant based protein powder (optional) 2/3 cup @califiafarms Unsweetened Almond Milk 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ground ginger 1/4 tsp ground cloves . 1️⃣Combine all ingredients with enough milk to make a thick batter. 2️⃣Heat a non-stick pan and spoon 2 tbsp on for each pancake. Once firm, flip + cook other side until golden. 3️⃣Layer with banana + berry slices and top with vegan yoghurt and walnuts. ENJOY😋💫 . For the yoghurt, I mixed in some more of the gingerbread spices to my homemade vegan Green yoghurt, you could also use coyo! . #califiafarmsau #collab #plantbased #plantbasedmilk
user_7;user_7193.jpg;In case you need the REMINDER: There’s no diet or meal plan or food rules that will give you the ‘perfect body’🤚🏼 . Why? 1️⃣What even is a perfect body anyway? We are all unique and different. Even if we all ate and exercised in exactly the same ways, we’d still look totally different!😇 You are your own worst critic, and the ‘flaws’ you’re so focused on other people probably don’t even notice about you. You are YOU and that is your greatest power. And you are SO much more than the outer appearance of your body anyway. . . 2️⃣No ONE food will make you healthy, gain weight, lose weight etc etc. Adding a superfood powder to your breakfast won’t make you live forever. Having one meal out with friends won’t make you put on 5kg. It’s the overall picture that matters!! Are you focusing on nourishing your body with a wide variety of wholefoods the majority of the time?🥑🍌🍉🥗🌮 . 3️⃣Following a strict meal plan or rules around food creates restriction and feelings of failure when you don’t stick to them. That’s not healthy. YES it can be super helpful to have a rough meal plan for certain stages + goals (eating disorder recovery and athletes being an example!)...but these help provide structure and guidance to best fuel your body, not restrict you☺️🙏🏼 . Let’s stop with the constant comparison of what others are eating with the aim of looking like them. Let’s START focusing on how we can fuel and nourish our bodies to OUR needs, to feel OUR best💛 . P.S. Gonna be real honest and say I’m super uncomfortable with posting this picture and can see a million things ‘wrong’ with it. But truth is, in that moment the picture was taken I was feeling happy, strong + in one of my favourite places...THAT’S my truth. Not the negative critical voices in my head when I saw the photo afterwards🤚🏼

user_7;user_7195.jpg;Creamy SALTED CARAMEL OATMEAL⭐️💫 what all breakfast dreams are made of! . A bowl of oats is one of my favourite things to eat after training. Apart from the fact that they’re just delicious, they’re also: ✅Packed full of complex carbs to replenish glycogen stores. ✅Provide protein (both the oats, plus protein powder or soy milk) for muscle growth + repair. ✅Quick to make and easy to digest!. ✅I also added a serve of @switch_nutrition Adrenal Switch for magnesium + zinc to further promote muscle recovery and help wind down. My code is NINA10 😌 . RECIPE: 2/3 cup rolled oats 1 cup plant milk 1 serve @switch_nutrition Salted Caramel Adrenal Switch 1 chopped medjool date Pinch of sea salt 2 tbsp vanilla plant protein . 1️⃣Add oats and milk to pot with chopped fats, bring to the simmer and cook stirring until porridge is thick + creamy. 2️⃣Stir in Adrenal Switch, sea salt and protein. 3️⃣Spoon into a bowl and top with banana, blueberries + nut butter. ENJOY💛💛
user_7;user_7196.jpg;The ULTIMATE #VEGAN SANDWICH~ yes or no?😛🙌🏼 not really being much of a meat person at all, deli meats was not really something I missed at all going vego, BUT after my Mum kept complaining she was sick of the same old avocado + hummus salad sandwiches (is that possible?💁🏼‍♀️) and didn’t know what else to put in them, I thought I’d have a go at making my own ‘deli meat’. And quite glad I did!! . Packed with flavour + ‘smokiness’, and even the texture is meaty and a little chewy. A little salty. They’re just REALLY good! 🕺🏼🕺🏼 . And perfect to go in a salad sandwich to take things to the next level, and add a good source of plant protein!⚡️🌱 . I love these deli slices in a sandwich made with my fluffy ‘Best Ever Gluten Free Bread’ (the recipe is in my Nourish Me Ebook) with lettuce, tomato, carrot, beetroot, pickles and Dijon mustard. Totally gourmet!!👌🏼 . RECIPE is up on my blog now ~ link is in my bio💛💛

user_7;user_7198.jpg;GINGERBREAD CHEESECAKE SLICE🤩💫 tis the time for all the festive snacks, which means gingerbread everything, right?💁🏼‍♀️ . A high plant protein, high calcium and absolutely deelish dessert or snack for the festive season that I am absolutely loving at the moment. I keep my batch in the freezer so it lasts longer and I will admit I eat it straight from the freezer ~ tastes like ice cream cake!!🙌🏼 . RECIPE: 1 batch Gingerbread Crunch bliss balls (see my recipe a few posts back!!) 400g silken tofu or #vegan yoghurt of your choice 50g vanilla plant protein, I used @macr0mike . . 1️⃣Press gingerbread bliss ball mix into a lined tin or container to make the base. 2️⃣Blend tofu/yoghurt with protein until smooth and creamy, then pour on top of base. 3️⃣Place in the freezer to set, then slice into bars. ENJOY!!💛💛
user_7;user_7199.jpg;23 laps around the sun today🌞✨ and in true spirit, I thought I’d share 23 things I’ve learnt in this past year✌🏼 . 1. You’re so much happier when you stop putting so much pressure on yourself to be perfect all the time. . 2. Don’t underestimate the importance of sleep. . 3. You need to give yourself breaks to do nothing. Read, draw, do something relaxing NOT ‘productive’. . . 4. Eating more doesn’t always mean gaining weight. Sometimes it’s just having more energy, being stronger + healthier. And gaining weight can be super rewarding! . 5. If you don’t try, you’ll never really know. . 6. The only things that you regret are the things you DON’T try. . 7. Trust your gut. It’s pretty much always right. . 8. Adding some salt or soy sauce makes tofu taste a million times better. . 9. The less rules and restrictions around food you put on yourself, the healthier you’ll be physically AND mentally. . 10. It always seems impossible until it’s done. You are SO much more capable than you think you are! . 11. Frozen fruit tastes better and is way more fun to eat than room temperature. Just saying💦 . 12. Feeling like a dead zombie all the time is not worth having the lowest possible blood sugars 24/7. Even non diabetics have fluctuations! . . 13. Patience + consistency are what give you the best results in pretty much anything. . 14. Don’t be a people pleaser. Stand up for yourself + your values. . 15. Meal prep is the real game changer🙌🏼 . 16. If you can do it now, do it. Don’t put it off until later! . 17. Just be yourself. Trying hard to make people like you is exhausting + not worth it. . . 18. Just ask! If you don’t, the answer will always be no. . 19. Life is so much better when you stop worrying about others will think of you💫 . 20. There’s a big difference between being alone, and being lonely. . 21. There is no love hate relationship like that with fake tan... . 22. Doing more won’t always make you better. Sometimes resting more will make you better! . 23. No one really has everything figured out, even the ones that look ‘perfect’. Life is messy and we’re all just learning and growing together💛🌈🌻
