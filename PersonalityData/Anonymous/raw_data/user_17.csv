user_17;user_170.jpg;Hey guys, it’s that time of my life again🙏🏼💕 I’ve got 200+ ounces of pumped breastmilk I'd love to donate to a parent in need on island (Maui) with a baby who is not receiving breastmilk but the parent would like them to be. I don't smoke, drink, or take any medications. I eat a whole foods vegan diet, rich in organic fresh fruits and vegetables. I use proper storage/freezing techniques. And I’m going to keep pumping once a day to donate. I also did this when Sandy and Scout were born for the first year of their life and donated over 3,000 ounces of breastmilk each time. It’s a rewarding experience because if I were ever in a situation in need of milk for my baby, I would be so grateful for mothers who had extra breastmilk to share. I am a huge advocate for working towards a strong parent community of human milk for human babies.  If you are interested in this or know a mom/dad who lives on Maui that is looking for donor breastmilk, comment below (or email me through the contact page of my website) so we can connect! A lot of people ask me how I’m able to pump a substantial amount of milk consistently + fulfill all my baby’s needs. I share all my pumping tips in my in depth ebook “Tips for Successful Breastfeeding” that a lactation consultant contributed to as well. f you’d like to check it out you can get it on my website. I made it affordable for more mothers to be able to get their hands on it but if you are unable to spend the $10 at this time feel free to email me and I’ll send it to you for free. Or if you already own the ebook and know a friend who would benefit from it, feel free to send it to them.  Whether you have extra milk to share or are looking for donated breastmilk for your baby in your location, you can go to Facebook and type in “Human Milk for Human Babies” and enter your state if you live in the US to see if there is a group nearest you to connect with mothers in need/sharing milk. Or if you know other resources that make it easy to connect with parents in need please share below. And if you feel inspired to do so and have the time, mental wellness, and extra milk to spare, I encourage you to pump/donate as well. Xo
user_17;user_171.jpg;Best friends @naturalwellnest ❤️❤️❤️i love you soo much my uplifting, confident, beautiful and positive friend with such a giving heart. You are always there for anyone who needs it, you are incredibly loyal and reliable, you empathize and validate every single person’s lived experience, you are a go-getter, and you inspire me in so many ways. I’m thankful to call you friend. Photo by @nessa.black Thanks friend love you!
user_17;user_172.jpg;Rise and Grind. You are the variable that has the most impact on your future and you are in control of THAT variable. - Dave Ramsey  Empower yourself with this mindset. Surround yourself with positive uplifting people and messages that YOU are worthy and valuable and can be who you want to be in life with hard work and consistency (because you are! All of you, no matter what you’ve gone through, no matter what anyone has ever said about you.) What you focus on grows. Encouragement is powerful. These type of reminders can do wonders for one’s mental health in grounding ourselves and therefore the choices one makes in their lives. And it all starts in the home. It starts with our children. I know I’ve said it again and again but truly I believe this to my core. You got this. I believe in you. The power is within you. Do you see it and feel it? Rise up and take control of your life. Personal responsibility is key. Focus on your own growth instead of pointing the finger at others, I promise it will be so much more beneficial to not only your life but everyone else’s life you touch as well. ESPECIALLY your children. Be aware, be thankful for what you have and feel gratitude. Uplift those around you. Work on yourself. Don’t let other people’s opinions or assumptions about you effect your life. Ultimately it is your choice if you let it but protect your energy where needed. Help others when you can. Always be respectful. What we really need is unity and love and truly believing in each other.
user_17;user_173.jpg;One of the meals brought to us in the first few weeks after Koufax was born was this incredibly nourishing meal by @mokuroots . THANK YOU SO MUCH ALEXA AND ERICA we are so grateful!  Moku Roots is a bomb zero waste restaurant with a huge emphasis and passion towards locally grown foods. They have these amazing Kalo (taro) burgers that they wrap in Ti leafs when ordered to-go👌🏼, and really all their food is super delicious. So if you’re on the west side or visiting the island you gotta enjoy a meal at Moku Roots while you are here - supporting locally grown food, sustainability and delicious🌱plant-based eats. Food from left to right: v/gf chocolate cake with pb frosting, kale avocado salad with buffalo cauliflower. Cobb salad, and two vegan cheese balls, crackers, falafel, burrito and eggplant parm sandwich. 👅🙌🏼🍃

user_17;user_176.jpg;These words can be impactful for the relationships you have with adults as well. Connection and authenticity. You cannot manipulate your way into getting your children to “behave how you desire.” And even that phrase shows the intention there: “how to get your children to behave how you want” should be shifted to >> uplifting them with authentic connection, encouraging them to be the best version of themselves they can be - so they can go out and be a positive impact on the world around them. << It starts within. We must first heal ourselves in order to best connect with our children (and others!) and raise the next generation filled with love, kindness and respect for all. How are you treating others? They are watching us and learning from our every move. How do you speak about others? They are listening. How do you view the world? As my friend @torre.washington states so well: YOUR MINDSET DETERMINES YOUR REALITY REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY THINK. How you view the world will impact how your children will view the world and then will therefore impact their life choices and how they treat others. How you treat them, be it through tricks and manipulation, or a deep connection and truly listening to your children >> will affect how they will in turn treat others as they grow. <<
user_17;user_177.jpg;Postpartum healing tea. Red Raspberry Leaf and Stinging Nettle. Thank you to my wonderful doula Haley @hokubirthmaui for bringing me this tea a few days after I gave birth along with home baked bread and Moringa Mushroom Barley Risotto. You. Are. Amazing. If you’re on Maui looking for a Doula, Haley is wonderful. She was present for both Scout and Koufax’s birth 💕

user_17;user_179.jpg;(Part 2 of 2) POSTPARTUM TALK 👌🏼It’s important to REST as much as possible. Now is NOT the time to be over achieving. Resist the urge to pick up around the house or go out on errands before your body is ready. Ask for help and be specific what you need. If you are a single mom, reach out to friends or family you trust to take care of you during this time - making you meals, doing your laundry, and helping with your other children if you have them. 👌🏼Have a friend set up a meal train for you at mealtrain.com and send to friends/family to sign up. What a blessing it is to have friends bring us food every evening so Andrew doesn’t have to make dinner. A home cooked prepared meal is the biggest help in those first few weeks after birth. 👌🏼if this if your first birth, hire a lactation consultant to come to your house within a few days after giving birth. MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. I also have an affordable “tips for successful breastfeeding” ebook on my website if you’re interested. 👌🏼Postpartum cramping : Take “Afterease” Wishgarden tincture. SLEEP as much as possible-sleep when baby sleeps (easier said than done though.) Drink red raspberry leaf tea and stinging nettle tea. 👌🏼First signs of mastitis: sore spots on your breast- small patches or red marks in the sore area(s), body aches, chills, and a fever. At the first signs of mastitis contact your healthcare professional and take action to prevent it from turning into a full blown infection. REST as much as possible, breastfeed on demand (breastfeeding will draw the infection out and, no, it will not hurt your baby), take “Happy Ducts” Wishgarden Herbs tincture, eat a healthy plant filled diet, hot showers on your breasts while you massage the sore areas to the tip of your nipple. Place cold cabbage leaves on your breasts! Feels AMAZING. 👌🏼LOVE YOUR BODY. Love that round soft belly, your body just did something truly amazing! It takes time to heal. Be gentle on yourself and ultimately spend your days snuggling with baby skin to skin.  Photo by @chelsea.jean @chelseajeanpresets
user_17;user_1710.jpg;(Part 1) POSTPARTUM TALK:  This is the phase of sensitive, engorged, leaking breasts. We go through a pile of laundry every day from my milk leaking all over my clothes and blankets. This is the phase of pp bleeding. If you’ve had a vaginal birth, its the phase of using a peri bottle or bulb douche to clean yourself after you use the restroom because of the sensitivity after giving birth. For those who have had c-sections there are other experiences from having major abdominal surgery-which I won’t comment on as I have not had the experience myself, but feel free to share below your experience if you would like to share. It’s the phase of sleepless nights and midnight diaper changes - poopy diaper changes without turning the lights all the way on to not fully wake up baby- more often than not, poop ends up on your hands. It’s the phase of postpartum cramping as your uterus shrinks (most often occurs after having multiple births, and often gets worse after each consecutive birth, but not every woman experiences this.) This time around I had the worst pp cramping I’ve had that came on every 15 minutes for the first few days. This is the phase of a soft round belly and ravenous hunger from producing breastmilk for your baby. But above all, it’s the phase of INTENSE LOVE AND BONDING WITH YOUR BABY. I’m gonna make a more in depth video on my PP experiences/tips but I’ll share some tips here too. There are obviously many more kinds of PP experiences for other women too, like depression, painful & longer road to healing from multiple stitches etc, but I’ll just speak on my personal experience: 👌🏼It’s important NOT to hold your breasts tight with bras to prevent let down. NOW IS THE TIME TO LET IT ALL HANG OUT. I know it’s messy but holding your milk in too often when your breasts are engorged can lead to a painful breast infection called mastitis. Instead, place a towel or blanket under your breast while you nurse on the other to let the milk go into. Or you can have your let down drip into a bottle to save. 🌸More postpartum tips on my next post 👆🏼 Photo by @chelsea.jean @chelseajeanpresets

user_17;user_1712.jpg;It’s a BOY!! 💙✨Koufax Miles Fisher (pronounced KO-FAX) was born in the comfort and safety of our home last Sunday evening right after sunset, weighing 9lbs 2oz. We are all so in love, he’s perfect in every way, and I can’t believe I have three wonderful boys that will one day all be taller than me. Scout sure has lots of loving boy energy surrounding her, she’s one lucky gal!  It was the most incredible and transformative birth, the kids got to be present while Koufax was born in the birthing tub on our deck as we all welcomed him into our family earth side. Oh Koufax, we love you more than life itself!  And a HUGE thank you to @chelsea.jean for beautifully capturing such an important and transformative experience for our family. We are so thankful to you!
user_17;user_1713.jpg;Andrew and the kids showered me with so much love yesterday on my 🎉birthday. They served me breakfast in bed of blueberry chocolate chip pancakes, fruit and🍊OJ, garden picked flowers, and birthday cards on a makeshift bed tray using an old rusted baking tray. Before the kids came in I heard them arguing over crayons in their room while they made me cards, then they came running in with excitement to surprise me with breakfast and necklaces they gifted me.  Then Andrew and I got to sneak away to the beach for a bit and picked up some @choicehealthbar smoothies and kale salads. We finished the night off with tacos for family dinner and watching Father of the Bride 2 after the kids went to bed. (It’s a TRADITION of ours to watch Father of the Bride 2 before giving birth to each child, haha.) Filled to the brim with their love. And also so ready to give birth and meet our new baby to welcome into our family. 🌸
user_17;user_1714.jpg;So many people are loving this Home Baked Omega Granola recipe my family loves that I’d thought I’d share the recipe one more time here for you to easily find when you’d like to make it: Easy Home Baked Omega Granola: 2.5 cups oats 1/2 cup uncooked quinoa 1/2 pumpkin seeds 1/4 cup hemp seeds 1/4 cup almonds, finely diced 1/4 cup dried tart cherries, diced 1/4 cup coconut flakes 2 heaping tbsp your favorite nut butter 1/4 cup maple syrup 1 tbsp vanilla  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir all the granola ingredients in a large bowl until well combined. Pour the mixture on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and spread flat across the tray. Bake for 15 minutes. Then pull out of the oven and gently toss the granola over then bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Keep an eye on the granola towards the end to make sure it doesn’t over bake. Store in an airtight mason jar to enjoy throughout the week. Enjoy!
user_17;user_1715.jpg;The house is deep cleaned and organized, thanks to Andrew’s surprise to me. The bulk items and homemade granola is stocked up. Home birth supplies are all set. I’ve finally finished with all my YouTube work “to do list” before baby arrives. I feel so settled and ready. Mentally I’m slowing down and savoring these special moments of anticipation and joy with my kids. We are so excited to meet our new baby, words cannot fully express.
user_17;user_1716.jpg;Me and my mom ❤️ Words cannot express my gratitude for you Mom, and all you’ve taught me. For your grace and kindness towards me and my sister our whole childhood. The quirky themed birthday parties you threw us every year. For letting me and Hannah figure out our arguments and hash it out, which was important for our growth. I’m thankful for your grounding presence and security you gave me as I grew. Your incredible ability to stay calm when you were frustrated. Like when I was a preteen, the time I asked to eat dinner upstairs so I could play “Where in the world is Carmen San Diego” on the computer. You said no at first because it was likely the spaghetti would spill on the carpet. Then I said I would be really careful so you obliged me. Only for me to walk down the stairs 5 minutes later, with sunken shoulders, to say, “I’m sorry mom, I spilled the entire plate of spaghetti on the carpet.” I had tripped and the whole plate of spaghetti slipped right off😂. To this day I’ll never forget that you didn’t show an ounce of anger. You simply gave a small sigh and said, “ok let’s go clean it up.” Im thankful for the role model you are to me, with your serving heart and all the things you do for others. And your ease to say you’re sorry when you make a mistake. I’m thankful for your trust in me. You and Dad trusted me and Hannah our entire childhood. As a result I never (or rarely) felt a desire to sneak things behind your back. Part of that was because I had friends who were positive influences on me, but part of it was because you trusted me and were always honest with me, so I showed the same honesty back to you. I love you mom. Thank you for showing me how to be a mom myself one day. I never truly grasped just how much you love me until I had a child of my own. Happy Mother’s Day.

user_17;user_1720.jpg;This Frozen Berry Sorbet + Home Baked Granola breakfast is my favorite right now and so easy. Filled with healthy fruits and omega and zinc packed seeds, it’s perfect as I approach the end of my pregnancy.  RECIPE For the Berry Sorbet: 2 cups frozen mango 1/2 cup frozen berries dash of maple syrup about 1 cup plant milk  Add just enough plant milk to get the blender going until smooth. Don’t add too much milk or else it will turn into a smoothie. You want it to be thick like an açaí bowl.  For the easy Home Baked Granola: 2.5 cups oats 1/2 cup uncooked quinoa 1/2 pumpkin seeds 1/4 cup hemp seeds 1/4 cup almonds, finely diced 1/4 cup dried tart cherries, diced 1/4 cup coconut flakes 2 heaping tbsp your favorite nut butter 1/4 cup maple syrup 1 tbsp vanilla  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Then pull out of the oven and gently toss the granola over then bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Keep an eye on the granola towards the end to make sure it doesn’t over bake.  Top your Berry Sorbet with as much granola as you desire then store the rest of the granola in an airtight mason jar to enjoy throughout the week.
user_17;user_1721.jpg;🎉🎈Happy 5th birthday my sweet, gentle-hearted, loving, and organized Sandy boy! Your eyes and smile light up my world and I’m so thankful I get to be your mommy.  Yesterday was his birthday and we celebrated his life with a surprise upon his awakening of a brand new bike and helmet he’d been wishing for for months, + water balloons, water squirters, vegan grilled cheese sandwiches and home made vegan chocolate cake on our deck with our friends Josefa + Quinn and their two boys (elvis and Sandy’s best friends) who we live on the same property with @naturalwellnest (In case you’ve missed me saying this before: we’ve followed lockdown guidelines of keeping our two families together as we live on the same property.) We ended the day with a movie and dinner of your choice - dad’s curried lentil recipe, your favorite. We love you Sandy, what a wonderful day it was celebrating you.

user_17;user_1723.jpg;These last few weeks as we prepare and await our new baby’s arrival are my favorite. Preparing the new baby items in our room feels nostalgic, with a flow and rhythm that is imbedded in my brain prior to every baby being born. Im uncomfortable in my body and feel like a beached whale when trying to find comfortable positions to sit or lay down on, but that seems so little in comparison to the joy and excitement for what’s to come. What will you look like? Are you a boy or girl? How will you enter this world and what will this birth be like? What personality will unfold in you? Birth is so amazing and empowering to me, I’m so looking forward to it and that moment when I get to hold my baby for the first time after all that hard work. And those tender moments when my older children get to touch and hold and squeal in excitement over their new baby sibling for the first time. JUST. THE. BEST.  I’ve got a little drawer set up with some baby items so far including hand-me-downs, a little outfit I found second hand for sale a couple months ago that I couldn’t resist, some super soft @thesimplefolkco newborn clothes and booties, and swaddling blankets. And I also invested in some new cloth diapers I was in need of, trying a new brand this time. I normally have used Bum Genius but I looked up good reviews for this brand Grovia, their Buttah line and I couldn’t resist that soft material and beautiful colors. I’ll let you know how I like them once I get to try them out! That’s all for now, just wanted to share where I’m at. I’m due in just a few weeks!
user_17;user_1724.jpg;Surinam Cherries: they are tart / sour / floral and my kids are obsessed with them. We planted a tree in our garden so one day the kids can sit beneath the tree picking these beautiful gems in abundance, letting the red juice run down their arms with enjoyment. We might plant another as well because it’s such a popular fruit at our house. Me on the other hand, a little too tart for my liking to eat more than just a couple at a time.
user_17;user_1725.jpg;I’ve been re-reading my favorite birth book as I prepare for labor, getting closer and closer to this sacred time, called “Orgasmic Birth” by Elizabeth Davis and Debra Pascali-Bonaro. I highly recommend it to anyone who’s having a baby soon. Since I normally have my hands full throughout the day with the kids and work, I’ve been trying to find a quiet moment by myself almost every day to sneak away for 30 minutes while Andrew watches the kids, normally in the evening as Andrew prepares dinner. I go outside on an uphill walk while I listen to the audiobook. Not only am I getting that much needed fresh air and exercise that’s so good for my body and baby, but I feel inspired through the beautiful reminders in the book, which helps get my mind in tune to the baby growing inside of me, this beautiful experience, and helps me focus on my present - when it’s so easy to let all that take a back seat. I find myself taking deeper breaths, finding peace on my walk, and thinking, “wow I really forget to give myself energy for this and often let myself get caught up in other things not essential right now.” Photo from over a month ago by @chelsea.jean @chelseajeanpresets My belly has grown so much already since then! Getting closer now! I’ll cherish these photos forever.
user_17;user_1726.jpg;I’ve been getting a lot of questions asking what homeschooling we’ve been doing lately. For those who would like some ideas to mix it up, or for parents who normally have their kids in school but they’re home right now and would like some fresh inspiration, here’s what we’ve been doing these past weeks/months. SWIPE RIGHT TO READ It, hope you find this helpful!  Overall we encourage our children to learn through all life experiences, not just when sitting down doing a lesson. LIVING IS LEARNING and when allowing children to learn what they are most excited about, and giving them the tools to do so, children thrive and love to learn.
user_17;user_1727.jpg;“Remember this, for it is as true as true gets: Your body is not a lemon. You are not a machine. The Creator is not a careless mechanic. Human female bodies have the same potential to give birth well as aardvarks, lions, rhinoceros, elephants, moose, and water buffalo. Even if it has not been your habit throughout your life so far, I recommend that you learn to think positively about your body.” - Ina May Gaskin  In my opinion, this reminder is in no way speaking to only pregnant women who have low risk pregnancies or an ease in getting pregnant, but rather, this message is for all women: whether low or high risk while pregnant, an ease to conceive or having trouble conceiving or carrying a baby. The message of learning to think positively about your body, no matter your circumstances or experiences, is integral and so important. Your thoughts about yourself shape your every day life and are impactful. You are wonderfully made just as you are.

user_17;user_1728.jpg;Rainbow Chinese Tempeh Salad. Mmm, it’s so delicious, brings back my childhood memories, and it can even be turned into spring rolls with the dressing as dipping sauce.

user_17;user_1730.jpg;We’ve been staying home and still going about our regular homeschooling activities and spending lots of time in the garden. And I already work from home so not much has changed for us personally. But I know that so many people have been negatively affected by this and I’m sending all the love to you right now. If you’ve lost your job, or are out of work right now due to the closures of things, are experiencing anxiety from the uncertainty of the future, or know someone who is sick and you’re nervous about it, I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. There’s a rainbow at the end of every storm and I hope you can find hope in this time.  One aspect I’m not hearing many people talk about is the inevitable deaths that occur due to huge downfalls of economies, which presently our economy is effected negatively as a result of the mass shut downs. Research shows that suicide rates go up during rapid economy downturn. People who are in poverty struggle more, and people struggling with addiction who recently got out of rehab and is starting a new life and finally got a new job to get back on track, only to be swiftly taken away, increases their likelihood going back into addiction and suffering and sometimes death. These are things I’m not hearing people talk about much and I just wanted to bring this to the discussion. Feel free to share your ideas on ways to help in times like this for those in need. If you know someone in your life who is struggling financially, and if you are able to support, helping in anyway you can can like buying their groceries makes a difference.

user_17;user_1733.jpg;I’m positive we will look back on these days as the best days of our lives. The days where we lend a shoulder to lean on when another is going through something tough. The days where we celebrate pregnancies through Blessingways filled with coffee scrubs, flower petals, affirming ceremonies, and ocean cleanses. And bring each other home cooked meals when a new baby arrives. And tinctures when one is home sick with mastitis. The days where we support each other’s work and business ventures, and everything within us wants the best for each other, to succeed in all ways they pursue. The days where we support and listen to each other’s perspectives, life experiences and struggles. The days where we cry together, laugh together, and take each other’s kids for a day so the other can catch a breath from the intensity of motherhood. The days where we bring over take-out food to be there and cry with one another when one is struggling to have a baby. The days where life is so insanely busy for each of us trying to juggle motherhood, relationships or pursuing careers - or all of it, that we understand how little time we really have for each other, but the time we do get to spend together is precious and well spent. These are the days we will look back and realize, how in the moment felt so intense and challenging, was the best ever to have each other by our sides through it all. It’s not always perfect, and some of us see each other more than others, but it is always filled with love. You know who you are, not all are pictured, I love all of you.
user_17;user_1734.jpg;Happy 2nd birthday our darling Scout! The day you entered the world changed our lives forever! It feels like yesterday I was pulling you up onto my chest, embracing your sweet little body as you let out your first cry in my arms. What an incredible experience.  We cherish every unique thing about you. Your sparkling personality, warm smile, strong sense of self, and large vocabulary / wonderful communication skills blows people away daily. Oh Scouty we adore you and are so thankful we get to be your family!
user_17;user_1735.jpg;Yummmm! Stopped for some delicious vegan food on the west side at @mokuroots after a day on the water with friends. Elvis’ got to practice surfing with a friend of ours and stood up on the board for the first time, yay! He was so proud and kept going back out to try again and again and again.  The Taro burger, lemonade, vegan sushi of the week, and kombucha at Moku Roots is to die for. If you’re ever on the island of Maui and looking for a good place to eat and support, you gotta check out @mokuroots.

user_17;user_1738.jpg;Farmer’s market papaya and lilikoi. My fave combo. I love whole plant foods (Lilikoi aka passionfruit 🌸) I went with a few friends to a Dr. Michael Greger talk last week from @nutrition_facts_org . He was a guest speaker on island and so many people showed up! Dr. Greger is a wonderful physician and amazing speaker with so much knowledge and an incredible amount of resources on plant-based nutrition. I highly recommend you check out his site, which is a strictly non-commercial, science-based public service website providing free updates on the latest nutrition research. From Dr. Greger: “Whenever there is a new drug or surgical procedure, you can be assured that you or your doctor will probably hear about it because there’s a corporate budget driving its promotion. But what about advances in the field of nutrition? The reason we don’t see ads on TV for broccoli is the same reason groundbreaking research on the power of foods and eating patterns to affect our health and longevity gets lost and buried in the medical literature–there’s no profit motive. It may not make anyone money, but what if our lives would profit?” Also my friend Simon from @plant_proof has a wealth of information on his page! He has his masters in nutrition and his podcast is amazing too - he interviews a diverse range of public figures from doctors, to influencers, to neurologists, to athletes who are all united by a shared passion for plant-based lifestyle. There’s so much valuable information from his podcast, def check it out if you haven’t already.  I hope you find these resources helpful, I think I’ll start sharing more of my favorites on plant-based nutrition from time to time for you guys to check out if you don’t already follow. ☺️
user_17;user_1739.jpg;This might seem like it was a peaceful morning based on this one photo and clip, but in reality we had one heck of a morning of craziness with spills, screams, big emotions, diaper explosions, and I was stressed with a lot of work I had to do for a time sensitive project, all while rushing to get everyone’s clothes on and teeth brushed before homeschool group. We came out to the swing to take a break which helped us both calm down and was worth being 5 or 10 minutes late.  And then I read this: ‘Someday when the kids are grown, we’ll have the clean house, open schedule, and five minutes of peace we long for in this season. And I think it might just break our hearts.’ words by @bouncing_forward

user_17;user_1745.jpg;The happiest people I know are evaluating and improving themselves. The unhappy people are usually evaluating and judging others - unknown  How true is this, over and over again we see this everywhere and within ourselves. Because we can only give others what we have within. Photo from a few days ago, a truly sublime sunset dinner on the deck. Those colors took my breath away, I’m thankful to have witnessed it with the sound of my children giggling in the garden below.
user_17;user_1746.jpg;Positive parenting is *not* passive parenting. It is not “let your children walk all over you” parenting, or letting them do whatever they want, whenever they want, type of parenting. It IS meeting children with love, kindness and respect while maintaining boundaries and implementing limits. It means having realistic exceptions for their emotional development - having empathy for all their emotions but not giving into demands and outbursts. It means being willing to negotiate with them at times when they show respect by politely relaying their perspective and ideas to you, NOT when they scream or demand. It means humbling yourself and being willing to apologize to your children when you make mistakes too, because after all, your children learn best through your example.  I think a lot of people get this confused. On both ends- from parents who feel negative thoughts around the idea of positive parenting and from those trying to implement positive parenting into their family life. The distinction is important.  Some people think gentle parenting means giving into tantrums but that not what it means.  And maybe some families do implement a more “children run the house” kind of way, but that’s not how we do it. Here’s an example that puts into perspective a few kinds of parenting: A parent and young child are at Target and the child asks to buy a toy. The parent says “no, not today” and explains why. The child begins to throw a tantrum,. He/she kicks and screams and yells and might even collapse on the floor rolling around in tears and agony because he wants the toy so much. ✖️Parenting option 1 yells back at the kid in anger at her child’s reaction and drags the child out of the store with phrases like “shut your mouth and stop whining right now! You’re 5 years old, not a baby! We’re going home now because of your attitude, and you’re not getting TV for a week.” (Continued in the comments...)

user_17;user_1748.jpg;Feeling so cozy and settled in our living room that’s coming together! Swipe right to see. I love the natural light and big windows, and still want to add some artwork on the walls if anyone has any local Hawaiian artist recommendations they’d like to share with me. We spend many hours a week in here as a family reading books, playing board games, and late night chats with my girl friends after the kids have gone to bed. And I love the quality pieces we filled the room with from @roomandboard .  More than 90% of @roomandboard ’s products are made in the U.S., supporting local economies, which is a huge plus for me. And they have many reclaimed wood, recycled material, and vegan furniture options. They even have free design services, which I took full advantage of, to get personalized ideas and advice from their non-commissioned Design Associates in their stores, over the phone or online. So you can ask an associate to help you sort out the vegan and most sustainable choices for you, plus get guidance on what pieces and wood colors look good together, etc, if desired. Thank you @roomandboard for helping me put together our forever home one day at a time with love and quality pieces.

user_17;user_1753.jpg;5 Healthy Vegan Pregnancy Tips. I’ve been vegan for over 13 years now and this is my 4th vegan pregnancy. I love pregnancy and birth and feel healthy, empowered, and grateful for the experiences. It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the world’s largest organization of food and nutritional professionals, that well planned vegan diets are healthful and nutritionally adequate for all stages of life including including pregnancy, lactation, childhood, adulthood, and athletes. (NCBI gov link in my stories)  Aside from the obvious health tips given while pregnant like eat sufficient calories, eat a wide range of whole plant foods, take your prenatal supplements, be active, and seek out prof. medical support, I wanted to share a few other tips for those who are pregnant/soon-to-be and are curious what I personally focus on while growing life inside of me.  1. Get to bed early. Your body is working really hard to nurture and grow your baby and soon you’ll be up multiple times in the night with a newborn. Soak up all the deep sleep you can get. I personally aim for 9:30 to 10pm most nights. As your belly grows, a pregnancy body pillow may be helpful for you to achieve comfortable deep rest. 2. Hydrate. Not only with water, but coconut water, and fresh watery fruits as well if u can! It’s very common to gravitate towards juicy fruits while pregnant & for good reason! Eating an abundance of fruits and veg truly make me feel my best-best digestion, energy etc. And to answer a Q I get asked a lot: I’ve never had gest. diabetes, and I maintain great bloodwork throughout my pregnancy. (Check out some studies Dr. Michael Gregor covers on nutritionfacts.org about lower rates of GB for vegans. Ill link in my stories) Tip: when I’m pregnant, cold water tastes so much better to me! So I chill my water and add lime/lemon!  3. Greens + high calories plant foods. Making it a priority to find ways to love dark leafy greens throughout my pregnancy is so beneficial. The easiest way to enjoy greens like collards and kale is in smoothies with ripe bananas/frozen fruit + hemp/chia/flax + nut butter/plant milk. (Continued in comments...)

user_17;user_1755.jpg;Happy 17 year anniversary babe🎉! This year we’ve been together more years of our lives than apart. How crazy is that. For those who are new here, he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were 15 and 16 years old at a high school New Years eve party when the clock struck 12am and we’ve been together ever since. We have a wedding anniversary too but I count our bf/gf anniversary just as much because we dated for 6 years before getting married. That’s a lot of years that count to me, haha! Swipe to see one of our first photos together when we had just started dating. Oh the innocence!

user_17;user_1757.jpg;Coming to you late but Merry Christmas everyone! We are in California with family and surprised the kids about the trip on the day of our flight. The boys’ shocked and uuber excited reaction was everything. We haven’t been to CA for Christmas in 7 years so it’s been a wonderful time for the kids to spend time with their cousins and grandparents. They each picked out presents to gift their grandparents and it was so fun for them to wrap them and gift them in person this year. We spent Christmas morning at my parents house and Scout was so excited to receive her new baby dolls that I got her from my favorite sustainable toy shop @the.small.folk . She’s been doting them around everywhere she goes now, rocking them to “sleep” and cuddling them every day. It reminds me of when Elvis and Sandy would play with their little babies at this age too, children’s natural desire to nurture and love is the best thing. I also got this super rad “layers of the forest” wooden puzzle for Sandy and a vintage looking educational shark book for Elvis from @the.small.folk too. Those plus presents from family im gonna need an extra bag to fly back home in a few days! I hope you are having a wonderful holiday season and sending love to anyone who feels lonely during the holidays.

user_17;user_1760.jpg;For 7 years we’ve had our hearts and goals on growing as much of our own food as we can, on land we could make sustainable, which is now coming into fruition. Our goal is to grow 90% of our own food within the next 10 years. We have desired this for so long for these reasons: to have a lighter footprint with our daily lives (because plastic food packaging creates a lot of waste), to grow healthy plant foods in nutrient rich soil for our family, to enrich the land we live on, and to save significant money on food costs for years to come.  The first few years Andrew worked 50 to 60 hours a week at two jobs, a grocery store and also at a zip line company. We lived in a really cheap place for rent and bought everything second hand so that we wouldn’t break even each month but rather could save money for this long term goal. Years later I began bringing in an income and we now have land and Andrew spends so much time and hard work into to growing lots of food, which I’m so so thankful for. So far we have a few mature coconut trees, 2 tangelo trees, an avocado tree, lots of banana plants, a full garden with delicious kabocha squash we pick weekly, kale, chard, lettuce greens, spicy peppers, lemon grass, herbs, 14 papaya plants, cassava, kalo (taro), and Tongan spinach. For future abundance we are waiting to bear fruit, Andrew planted a Brazilian cherry tree, a Surinam cherry tree, 4 more coconut trees, a sharwil avocado tree, a lychee tree, more citrus trees, an ulu tree (which is breadfruit and will supply a lot of calories for us when it fruits), a jackfruit tree and more bananas.  We are always going to buy bulk items like oats, lentils, seeds, and rice from the store, which we can purchase filling up in cotton bags, and im sure ill buy pasta here and there because…pasta is amazing. But imagine if this is the majority of our food in 10 years to come. It’s so exciting and inspiring to me. Anyways thanks for following along our journey!

user_17;user_1762.jpg;A couple weeks ago I was feeling cranky and snappy and totally downright impatient. As a result my kids were cranky too, and I’m telling ya, they feel my vibes a mile away. When I’m feeling positive and well balanced and patient, the way I react to my world around me is totally different. My kids feel more respected because I’m responding to them with patience. Half way through this cranky day, I was in the car with the boys and when I parked I turned around to tell them I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’ve been so cranky today and snappy and impatient. I probably need a good rest, will you forgive me? They forgave me and ended up saying they were sorry too-because as a result, they were super whiny and impatient as well throughout the day. Modeling the behavior of grace, that we can acknowledge we mess up too as parents, teaches them to be willing to apologize when they make mistakes too. and what a beautiful thing that is.
user_17;user_1763.jpg;At 15 weeks pregnant the baby inside of me has unique, one-of-a kind fingerprints that are visible already. He/she has fingers and tiny fingernails and toes and eyes and a face and developing organs. The baby’s heart is pumping roughly 25 quarts of blood every day and will continue as he develops in the womb. She has reflexes and can open and close her fingers and make movement with her mouth. Between 15 to 20 weeks baby will double in size. As his body grows, his nervous system is rapidly maturing. His nerves are connecting his brain to the rest of his body, traveling to the brain and then down the spine and beginning to extend into his torso and limbs. Sensory development is picking up speed and her brain is designating special areas for smell, taste, hearing, vision and touch. As your baby grows he creates a strong connection to you and is learning who you are. She can sense your mood and temperament. And just 21 days following conception - the baby’s organs start to develop, and the heart begins to beat. These developmental milestones often take place before the mother even knows she is pregnant. How amazing is the miracle of growing babies! Babies in the womb have intrinsic value. The difference between us and them is time.

user_17;user_1765.jpg;Thank you so much everyone for your well wishes and congrats. We are so excited for this little baby and looking forward to Scout getting to be a big sis. I love my family so much ❤️
user_17;user_1766.jpg;Baby number 4 is on the way! I’m overjoyed to share with you that im growing a little baby in my belly that will turn our family of 5 to 6 soon. The kids are beyond excited and we talk daily about how awesome it will be for Scout to be a big sister. She loves babies so much. And when Elvis found out I was pregnant he sweetly said later than day, with a confident mature undertone, “Well, Im gonna have 3 babies to take care of soon.” - because let’s be real, Sandy and Elvis are the best big brothers any little one could ever ask for.  I’m so excited for this birth and thankful for this experience. Pregnancy and birth is so amazing. And i’m constantly in awe of the miracle of life. Life is a handful lately and a constant balancing act but nothing brings me more joy than these little guys right here. My children (and their wonderful daddy) are my everything 🌸 #4thveganpregnancy
user_17;user_1767.jpg;HAPPIEST OF BIRTHDAYS my big 8 year old Elvis! 🎂🎉 Feeling so so thankful. We celebrated Elvis and his best buddy Gianni’s birthday together with lots of wonderful friends on our favorite beach with big pots of lentil curry & rice, watermelon, local papaya, longans, and lilikoi, popcorn, crackers and hummus. We had a piñata with sustainable goodies and the best vegan cupcakes with blue frosting and sprinkles made by the kindest friend @alohamauivegan . It was a cloudy but beautiful day and we stayed all afternoon until the sun set, as the kids played together endlessly in the water, coming home with sand filled hair. Thank you to everyone who came and celebrated with us. The boys are so thankful!  Elvis, you are so much more than I even fathomed and dreamed of as I was growing you in my womb. Thank you for making me a mother. The birthing experience bringing you earth-side utterly changed me forever in the most intense and amazing way. You’ve grown and matured so much over the last year and are the best big brother that Sandy and Scout could ever ask for! It’s always the best day celebrating your life which means more to me than you know. I love you Elvis.

user_17;user_1772.jpg;Happy Halloween from Darth Vader, Chewbacca, a chicken and best buddies Harry Potter and a policeman.  Here’s a few fun ways to celebrate halloween with healthy treats as an alternative! 1. The Switch Witch: We did the Switch Witch a couple times a few years back which is great for little ones! In case you don’t know what the Switch Witch is, it’s when after your children go trick or treating they leave their bucket of candies at the front door to give to the “switch witch” (i.e mom and dad) who switches out the GMO candies for healthy vegan treats and toys. The kids loveee doing this and some examples of healthy treats we switched out for were organic vegan chocolates, macadamia nuts, finger puppets, crayons, popcorn, silly straws, gum packs, longans -elvis’ favorite, coins, and more! 2. Trunk or Treat: “Trunk or treat” is essentially like regular trick or treating but instead of going door to door, all your friends pull up at a parking lot or a friend’s house and decorate their trunks halloween spooky style and pass out healthy organic treats/toys instead of processed candy. All the kids go around from trunk to trunk saying “trunk or treat!” 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃3. Throw a Halloween party: Ask everyone to bring a Halloween or fall-inspired dish to share and do halloween crafts together, make dry ice punch, blast spooky music and watch a kids Halloween movie.  This year we are doing a mix of Trunk or Treat and a Halloween party mixed together! Friends are coming over, bringing a dish to share and we’re gonna do a craft as well as trunk or treating. The kids are so excited!  Anyways hope you have a wonderful holiday! Ps -we’ve reused this hand-me-down chicken costume for every kids since elvis was 2! Love it ❤️

user_17;user_1774.jpg;❤️ He finally did it! In case you missed our recent YouTube video, Andrew shaved his mustache for the first time in 11 years. Our kids had never seen their dad without a mustache before so it was quite an event. He shaved the stache because we did a @charitywater campaign asking our wonderful viewers to help us raise $10,000 for charity: water and in exchange we would match up to that amount + SHAVE THE STACHE ON CAMERA👨🏻. We are so thankful for all of you because together we raised over $22,000 so quickly for charity: water, one of our favorite organizations to donate to.  Scout was pretty frightened at first upon seeing her daddy with his facial hair missing, but she’s gotten over it by now and loves him just the way he is, even without the mustache.  So what do you think? Should he keep it shaved or grow it back? I personally LOVE his mustache, but this is a fun change! (You can watch the kid’s reactions plus our previous video sharing all about why we love charity: water and why we did this on my YouTube channel. The videos called “Kids see their dad without a mustache for the first time” and “day in the life: special announcement”)

user_17;user_1776.jpg;✖️Avocados are full of healthy plant fats, are a great source of vitamins C, E, K and B-6, as well as riboflavin, niacin, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, and potassium. They also provide lutein, beta-carotene, and omega fatty acids. Healthy sources of fat-like from avocados, when paired with greens may maximize nutrient absorption. Because many of the nutrients greens are famous for are fat-soluble, including beta-carotene, lutein, and vitamin K. I love adding creamy diced avocado to my green salads and I’m extra excited for the day our Sharwil and Kahaluu avocado trees bloom and become fruitful. Both varieties are extremely creamy and delicious. These avocados pictured are from a generous friend’s backyard. #eatmoreplants #vegan #bestofvegan 🥑
user_17;user_1777.jpg;Its hard work watering the kalo and planting trees with your daddy and brothers. Gotta hydrate with a big glass of crisp cold water, and look ridiculously cute while doing it. They all love this bonding time with Dad and it makes me so dang happy. #teamworkmakesthedreamwork

user_17;user_1780.jpg;Attached at the hip- oh how they love each other. I was taking a picture of myself in front of our new mirror when these three slowly pop into my view, haha! Swipe right to see and also see the rest of me and Andrew’s bedroom finally coming together!  Im obsessed with this big Infinity mirror we just got from @roomandboard . After 10 months in our home, we are finally settling in. I took a long time deciding which furniture I wanted to fill our home with and I settled on @roomandboard because more than 90% of their products are made in the U.S., supporting local economies, and they have a lot of sustainable furniture options made from reclaimed wood and recycled items. I’m in love with the wooden bed frame we got as well, this is the first bed frame we’ve owned our whole marriage, over 10 years! We’ve just had our bed on the box springs this whole time. I feel like a new woman I tell ya.  Can’t wait to show you the rest of the beautiful Room & Board furniture we have filled our home with. I’m truly in love with these quality furniture pieces that will last a lifetime in our home. Stay tuned for a HOUSE TOUR video coming soon!

user_17;user_1782.jpg;I often think about how one day I won’t have constant messes from toys spread out all throughout the house, spilled and smeared food on the couches and countertops, pee drips on the side of the toilet, and gigantic loads of laundry to fold. No more little socks gone missing in the crevices of the ethers, no more need to delegate sibling rivalry and arguments, and no more constant snack making for little mouths to feed. They’re going to grow up and feed themselves one day! I’ll simply have much more time for myself and with my husband, but I think I’m going to miss the noise and even the chaos. I think about all the things ill miss that will no longer be. Those tender and quiet nursing moments, the constant cuddles, warm embraces under the sun with their salty ocean hair, and their sweet little voices. These days are far too short and will be gone in a blink of an eye. The days can be long but the years are short. One day they will be grown and we will be the one begging for their attention, not the other way around.

user_17;user_1786.jpg;Ohhh my goodness guys, I recently came across this old photo of SANDY that my friend @chelsea.jean captured and my jaw just dropped from his sweetness! They grow up so fast 😭.

user_17;user_1788.jpg;His birthday is coming up this weekend. He doesn’t like surprises, parties or being the center of attention. He doesn’t want a fancy gadget, new clothes or a nice watch. He just wants a card from his kids and quality time with his fam. And my birthday gift to him is normally to take over the household parenting duties 100% that day (take out the trash, brush the kids teeth, change all the diapers that day and do the dishes..that sort of stufff.) That’s what he wants. Done and done babe. I Love you. Photo by @cadencia

user_17;user_1790.jpg;Happy Monday folks! This little gal is constantly being loved on by her brothers. We are in the stage of life where as soon as she wakes up in the morning she runs over to her books and brings them to her brothers to read to her. They pick her up and carry her across the house, share their snacks with her, swing her in the hammock, help her put on her shoes, pick outfits out for her to wear, and run to her when she falls and cries. She loves their cuddles and care but sometimes it gets to be too much for her (like picking her up when she doesn’t feel like being held.) The look in her face in this photo says it all 😂. What a lucky little girl she is to have them! #family #siblinglove
user_17;user_1791.jpg;Reminiscing on Scout’s birth. Those tender first moments, soaking each other up, skin to skin. Isn’t life beautiful? The development of a baby truly seems like a miracle.  Hearing the heart beat really early and knowing that they’re a unique life growing inside of me, with they’re own unique dna fingerprint.  The birthing process is powerful, no matter your birth experience. You are powerful just as you are. How amazing it is bringing a new life into this world that my body created and helped bring into the world.  The bond created between the parents and baby that is really unique and special is nothing short of amazing to me.  Babies and births and family is special. (Photo of me holding Scout in the birthing tub for an hour, soaking her up, just born, and my midwife cutting the umbilical cord once the cord stopping pulsing. Captured by @cadencia )
user_17;user_1792.jpg;Your strengths are my weaknesses. Your weaknesses are my strengths. Instead of pointing the finger and constantly highlighting what our partner is lacking in perfection we can work on ourselves and be inspired by our partner’s strengths. What you focus on amplifies. And if we both follow those principles you get something even greater, fireworks are sure to abound.

user_17;user_1794.jpg;Along with launching Epic Plant-Powered Kid Food, I also launched another e-book on Breastfeeding Tips. Breastfeeding is hard work, much harder than it looks! I wrote this ebook to help empower and arm new mothers with information, inspiration and encouragement. A wonderful lactation consultant, Natalie Marcus (IBCLC & RN) collaborated with me on this ebook which makes me that much more proud of how it turned out. This ebook includes guidance, advice, and encouragement from both myself, a mother of three, and Natalie Marcus RN, IBCLC. I breastfed all three of my children and am still currently breastfeeding my youngest. I gathered all the information I wish I had easily handy when my first child was born.  This in-depth look at breastfeeding covers how breastfeeding works, tips to be successful at breastfeeding, common question and answers, troubleshooting examples, pumping tips, personal accounts and stories, beautiful breastfeeding images in tender breastfeeding moments, knowledge and expertise from Lactation Consultant Natalie Marcus, and encouragement throughout each page filled with inspirational breastfeeding quotes.  If you know any new mothers or soon-to-be-mothers who might benefit from this information, please let them know about this ebook. LINK TO BREASTFEEDING EBOOK IN MY PROFILE OR GO TO user_17.com  Thank you to all my friends and women I admire who allowed me to share their breastfeeding images in this book.

user_17;user_1795.jpg;We’re in California! Visiting family and making salads with my sis @hannah_mcneely in her newly purchased, way cool old-style home. SOO happy for her and her husband @ericrmcneely , and how cute is this little kitchen! The old tiles and cabinets + natural light, ah! Even toddlers can join the fun in salad preparation. Scout sure loves to be a part of it and everything I’m doing. This big green bowl of goodness has farmers market greens, sprouts, Hannah’s home grown cucumbers, chickpeas, organic corn, zucchini and squash, avocado, onion, cilantro and a random peanut lime dressing hannah threw together (just stir together peanut butter, lime, garlic, dash of maple syrup, chili flakes, and a tid bit of salt. (Yes hannah I’m making tid bit a word…it’s gonna be a thing, ok)  Remember: CHEW YOUR FOOD well and be mindful when you eat. As much as I relate to the craziness of life and how busy it can be with children, these little reminders to slow down and chew your veggies well (even or as best as you can amongst the chaos) always go a long way for me. :) I don’t always have time to chew big salads, but when I do, I chew them well. #randompost lol

user_17;user_17103.jpg;These melon Balls from Sandy’s birthday party were a hit with the kids! Just scoop melon out with mini ice cream scoopers and voila, you’ve got an easy and fun way to serve bright colored fruit at a party. Bonus points if you drizzle lilikoi all over it. Or you can put rainbow colored fruit on skewers (🍓strawberry, 🍊orange, 🍍pineapple, 🥝kiwi, then blueberry etc) because what kid wouldn’t love to eat a rainbow on a stick? I have an entire section in my ebook on healthy food for child birthday parties that are both delicious and sure to crowd please. Tons of plant powered kid recipes coming up! 💪🏼🙌🏼I’m getting so close to finishing it and can’t wait to share it with you guys!
user_17;user_17104.jpg;Your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it ~ Rumi On top of the world with my one and only @andrewfisher44 (not really top of the world, more like a regular sized mountain😜 but still), there’s plenty of ups and downs together but it’s always challenging ourselves to grow and be better *ourselves* instead of pointing the finger at the other. Finding that space within your heart to allow love in, look at things in simpler perspectives instead over thinking and breaking down barriers within yourself, one. day. at a time.
user_17;user_17105.jpg;I had a GREATTT birthday🎉 last week, I got to go on a special girls morning on the water with friends and my mom who was in town + stopped at @aarootsmaui for a delicious vegan lunch. And the kids and Ang embraced me with extra love all day filled with cards, cuddles, little notes for me left around the house and my choice for what’s for dinner. Plus andrew did all the laundry and changed all the diapers, now that’s love 😜what more could a mama ask for? 🙏🏼❤️
user_17;user_17106.jpg;It wasn’t until I had my own children and felt that indescribable love expansion within my own heart did I realize just how much my mother loves me, adores me, and cherishes me. Happy mothers day Mom, I’m so thankful for how you raised me - always reminding me to just be myself even when I came home crying from being made fun of in school. Always uplifting me, trusting me, and staying calm, even when you were frustrated. I literally have zero memories of you raising your voice at me. Always being patient, even when I spill an entire plate of spaghetti on the carpet. Your reaction to that in calm and peace sticks with me vividly to this day. I really believe your example helped model for me be the best mom I can be to my three children whom I love more than this world. ❤️❤️❤️And like some friends so thoughtfully brought attention to last year, it almost feels crucial to bring up every year. Special thoughts and love go out to all those who struggle on this heart opening sensitive day. To those who have miscarried, those who have lost children earth side, those who have lost their own mama, and those longing to be mothers. You are so loved and cherished and we celebrate all of you. ❤️❤️❤️ #happymothersday
user_17;user_17107.jpg;We’ve been spending the week hiking, swimming, jumping off rocks into an ocean pool, paddle boarding, reading books on ecology with the kids, and making home cooked meals with close friends all week. It’s been such a fulfilling week and I love love watching my kids engage with, look up to, and learn from other adults who are positive role models in their lives.  @carlytaylor269 is serenading the boys to bed singing beautiful songs while playing her ukulele every night - tomorrow she’s gonna teach them music chords, and @jamesaspey goes on beach walks with the kids answering any and every question they ask him. The kids learn so much by having other adults to listen to and have mutual respect with like from one of their closest auntie and uncle @naturalwellnest & @quinn.il.eskimo . Elvis is reading books to Sandy in the car rides we take and a milestone for Sandy is that he can now pick up and carry his little sister Scout. They both love it and were smiling so big when Sandy proclaimed, “Look momma I can pick up Scouty now!” I’ll put some videos in my stories of this, it melted me so hard😭
user_17;user_17108.jpg;This classic vegan Mac n cheese is going in my ebook, and I’m almosttt finished with it! Hoping to have it ready within the next couple months! Can’t wait to share it with you!

user_17;user_17109.jpg;First time seeing a *baby* sea turtle resting on the sand here in Hawaii. The kids were so excited (always give them plenty of space and never touch them.) We’ve seen hundreds of older sea turtles resting on the shore, which is always beautiful and wonderful, but there’s something so special about babies of all kinds. Baby monkeys, kittens, baby pigs, baby humans, puppies, and even baby turtles.

user_17;user_17112.jpg;So much beauty in fresh organic fruits and vegetables. 🌸Have you ever had dragon fruit? What’s your favorite fruit? Mine is an obvious MANGO 🥭but I love a good dragon fruit, lychees, longans, durian, and papaya. Most of these fruits don’t taste that great if it was grown conventionally and shipped across the world though. So what fruits grow locally for you and taste amazing? If you ever visit Hawaii be sure to go to the local farmer’s markets to get the locally grown organic produce and support our farmers. What might be surprising to a lot of people is over 90% of the food on the island is imported here even though we live in the perfect climate to grow everything we need. The more we buy locally grown plants 🌱 and support the farmers, and the more we put efforts in to growing our own food, the better we take care of the aina and is good for the planet🌏
user_17;user_17113.jpg;How good a reminder is this. “People are often unreasonable and self-centered. Forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives. Be kind anyway. If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway. If you find happiness, people maybe jealous. Be happy anyway. The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. For you see, in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway.” - Mother Teresa

Feels like only yesterday I was pulling her up onto my chest, embracing her soft wet body as I heard her first cry in my arms.

user_17;user_17120.jpg;Andrew and I just finished an 8 week marriage course and it was soo good for us. Even after being together over 16 yrs we still have so much room to understand each other’s emotional needs better. Sometimes we get in a rut cuz it’s easy to let our relationship take a back seat with all the business of life, work and raising kids! But in order to have a fulfilling marriage we gotta make our relationship a priority. You gotta put in the effort to reap the rewards.  Most of the time when we aren’t vibing great, are arguing a lot, or just don’t feel good feelings about each other, it’s because we aren’t meeting each other’s basic emotional needs in the way that we individually need it most. We might be showing love to each other, but not in the way your partner appreciates it best.  Have you ever read the book “The 5 Love Languages”? I highly recommend it if you are new to this concept of showing love to each other in different ways. The 5 Love Languages are: words of affirmation acts of service quality time physical touch and gifts. And the course we did went into even more detail. The top 10 basic emotional needs in the course were: Affection, sexual fulfillment, intimate conversation, recreational companionship, honesty and openness, physical attractiveness, financial support, domestic support, family commitment, and admiration.  Have you ever discussed this with your spouse? Have you thought about what specifically makes you feel most loved by your partner and shared what your partner can do to make you feel loved, satisfied and fulfilled and vise versa? Sometimes all it takes is some tweaking in how you show your partner love for fireworks to take off like when you first started dating. Because “more often than not, being right or wrong for someone depends not on some mysterious compatibility quotient, but on how willing and able you are to meet that someone’s needs.” (Quote by Willard Harley Jr.)
user_17;user_17121.jpg;Elvis tenderly holding a rescued chicken at the Leilani Farm Sanctuary ❤️🐓 @laureleeblanchard . Andrea is her name 🐓, she answers to your call, and runs up for pets and cuddles. The boys all took turns holding her with excitement. It’s a beautiful thing to see how naturally and instinctually loving that children are towards animals. #vegan #healthyvegankids
user_17;user_17122.jpg;The vegetables in our garden are growing so abundantly right now! In our garden bed currently: lettuce, chard, 🌱kale, basil, squash, 🍅tomatoes, papaya, lemongrass, chives, kalo (taro) and cassava. Andrew has been working so hard planting all kinds of fruit trees too🍊🥑, and he’s so good at it! He layers everything with vegetable compost and wood chips for mulch. If you haven’t seen our Hawaiian Home Garden Tour YouTube video yet ill fill you in. We already have a few mature coconut trees on the property, a couple tangelo trees, and an avocado tree but he now has planted more fruit trees that are growing and will eventually provide abundance for us over the years: another avocado tree and coconut tree, A lychee tree, surinam cherry tree, Brazilian cherry tree, jackfruit tree, lime tree and more bananas and papayas. He also dug a beautiful compost area and planted papaya seeds all around it last week. And he still wants to plant an Ulu (breadfruit) tree and also more citrus. He’s working so hard, creating a sustainable life for us- and its damn sexy to me! Im really thankful for the home grown vegetables Andrew grew for our salads and smoothies this week.🙏🏼
user_17;user_17123.jpg;Happy first birthday my sweet Scout🎉! Or as a couple friends said to me yesterday “happy birthing day mama”. ❤️❤️I cant believe it was a year ago yesterday that I pulled this beautiful little girl up onto my chest at home, in total euphoria. Her auburn hair, bright personality, and loving embraces are everything for us and the boys just ADORE her. Feeling so THANKFUL. Love you Scouty more than life itself!

user_17;user_17125.jpg;🌈Family dinner on the deck. Sharing Rainbow Spring Rolls this evening filled with veggies, tofu, avocado, sprouts and topped with sesame seeds- dipped in a ginger tahini dipping sauce. Family dinner is a ritualistic time for us that we do almost every evening to come together, share a meal, and talk about our day. We often play the “high low” game where we go around sharing what our high of the day was and our low of the day. Sometimes the kids’ low might be “when I got in an argument with my brother” and the high might be as simple as “playing outside with my friends”. It’s a great way to open up and create positive family memories sharing about our day and feelings over a meal. And sometimes per Elvis’ request we play “quiz game” where we ask him and Sandy history, math, or spelling questions for them to answer😂they love it. Did you grow up having family dinner every night? Both Andrew and I did, and are grateful to get to do the same with our little fam. 🙏🏼

user_17;user_17127.jpg;“Look I see a whale mama!” 🐋😍Doesn’t it look like that’s what she’s saying? #pacificwhalefoundation
user_17;user_17128.jpg;These two getting so big I can barely handle it and having the time of their life humpback whale🐋watching with the @pacificwhalefoundation boat tours. They’re a non profit who have helped protect the humpback whales that migrate to Hawaii from November to May every year. The kids learn so much from the marine biologists and the employees give one on one time with the keiki (littles) while on tour, educating and sharing their passions with them about whales. It’s super neat and def worth doing if you visit Hawaii during whale season. In case you don’t know, humpbacks migrate to Hawaii during these months to have their babies! We’re going back to another whale tour in a couple weeks with our homeschool group. The kids fundraised for their trip with a lemonade stand🍋👌🏼. And the week before that they learned so much through delegating tasks and who will bring what supplies, figuring out how much money💲they needed to raise to go on a special tour together, marketing techniques etc. such a special time for our keiki, will remember these boat tours forever. Whales are so magnificent 🙌🏼🙌🏼 (🍋Lemonade stand photos by @chelsea.jean ) #saynotoseaworld #homeschooling #livingislearning

user_17;user_17138.jpg;🎉HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABE! Getting ready for the photo: “Hold me like you like me babe!” Haha jk we really do like each other and today is our 16th year anniversary of being together! Next year we’ll have been together more years in our life than we not. DAng!! Andrew always jokes with me why I care about our official boyfriend/girlfriend anniversary more than our wedding anniversary and it’s because we were together for so much longer before we got married! To say we’ve been married for almost 10 years doesn’t fully explain us haha. Cuz we DATED for 6 years before we got married. He asked me to be his girlfriend when we were 15 and 16 years old at a New Years eve party when the clock struck midnight and I still remember the details of that night like it was yesterday. The rest is history and never would we ever have dreamed the life (and lives👦🏼👦🏼👶🏼) we have created together over the years! I love you babe more than words can express: the ups, the downs, the arguments, the deep connection, the tough moments, the easy times, I take it all with you and embrace it FOR LIFE. Happy New Years guys! 🎉
user_17;user_17139.jpg;🎥Watch until the end to see Scout making the sweetest little sound! I’ve decided it’s my favorite sound ever in the entire universe. I LOVE THESE MOMENTS from Christmas day! Full video on my YouTube channel, Ellen Fisher (“Day in our Hawaii life // Christmas Day”) Or you can swipe up in my Insta stories. Let me know in the comments below if you watched the video! My favorite part is when Sandy shows everyone his 3d penguin puzzle.. and the football wrestling with dad…oh and of course Scout’s excited noises that are music to my ears. What did you like about it?  I was just thinking yesterday as I was editing this video how if I had not captured these seemingly insignificant moments on film, about 90% of these moments would have already been forgotten, but now I have them encapsulated to easily remain embedded in my family’s memories forever, and for that I am so grateful. These little moments: the joy in their eyes, their giggles, their proud moments, their smiles, their..everything.. are everything for me. Music by @gvozmusic - Sunlight via @hellothematic
user_17;user_17140.jpg;5 tips that help me feel my best: 1. Eating a WHOLE FOODS plant based diet centered around fresh fruits and vegetables. (Sweet tropical papaya- you are my fave.) I’ve been vegan for over 12 years now, had 3 healthy vegan pregnancies, raising 3 healthy vegan kids, and I’m never going back. Not only is a plant based diet better for the environment and our health (a whole foods plant based diet is the only diet clinically proven to reverse America’s number #1 killer-heart disease), it also is kinder to the animals- it’s the least we can do for the animals we share this earth with. Because to first decide if something is humane, we must ask ourselves if we would like it done to ourselves. 2. Avoiding/keeping to a minimum: processed foods/processed sugar. Avoiding these foods helps keep my skin clear. 3. Getting to bed early/sufficient sleep. Scout wakes up a couple times a night still so I am on it to get to bed early so I have my best chance at getting enough sleep. Going to bed late does not do my body good, haha. 😜 4. Exercising/moving my body for even just 20-30 minutes a few times a week does wonders! I I’ll even hold the littles as weights for squats and lunges 😂to just get.it.done. 5. Self care/self love. Surrounding myself with uplifting individuals who are kind and always working towards bettering themselves. Having these types of relationships in my life help keep STRESS levels low and nourish my mind and soul. I feel better now than I did in my teens and just wanted to share the tips that have helped me feel my BEST. I used to have sluggish digestion, acne and low energy. I used to calorie restrict to not gain weight. But eating a whole foods plant based diet makes me feel SO dang good, and I eat in abundance until I’m satisfied-body and mind. Eating *sufficient calories* is so key (for this: fill up on high calorie whole plants foods like sweet fruit, squashes, sweet potatoes, quinoa, beans, lentils, etc) + some healthy fats from avocado, hemp seeds, walnuts, and flax seeds, etc and LOTS of greens keeps me satisfied and loving life. Above all though, I am Vegan for the animals and I’ll tag some awesome vegan activists that inspire me in my stories.

user_17;user_17146.jpg;I quite literally love you with every fiber of my being and could not love you more if I tried! ✨  Thank you for the capture @chelsea.jean , I’m gonna frame this one.
user_17;user_17147.jpg;I think most of us are walking around with hurts and unhealed parts of ourselves, projecting those hurts onto others in some form or another-either from time to time or often, either subtly or profoundly, which play out in different ways. And this is a helpful way to reflect before responding in relationships/life experiences/encounters. Once we realize this, it’s a lot easier to not take things personally. Cuz nothing anyone does is ever really about you. It’s much more about themselves-including me and how I respond to you. I recently did this thing called “tapping” or “mind change method” with my friend Heather to reshape my memories and help heal parts of my wounded self. We went back to this one experience at the school yard in elementary school when a girl walked up to me and said “so and so wanted me to tell you that she hates your guts and she thinks your ugly.” My actual experience was that I ran away crying and at home that night my mom held me in her arms with words of encouragement to soothe me. But Heather helped me imagine walking up to the girl who was sneering with her friends at the back of the recess lot. And place myself inside of her body. And feel what she was feeling. That she was hurting and alone and insecure, and felt ugly herself. Heather asked me to place a seed inside of her heart with words she needed to hear to heal- that she is beautiful and loved just the way she is. Then I took myself out of her body and stood in front of her. Her face turned from sneering to smiling at me and we embraced. Quote of the day: “Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.” -Eckhart Tolle  Photo by @chelsea.jean
user_17;user_17148.jpg;SOUND ON🎧If you haven’t seen already, Simon Hill from the @plant_proof podcast and I got to sit down together for a chat! We talk about my story and why I changed my diet 12 years ago, my 3 vegan pregnancies, breastfeeding and tips to improve supply, supplements we take as a fam, tips about plant based food & children, attachment parenting, homeschooling/life schooling and so much more. Check it out if you wanna have a listen, the link is in my IG stories or go straight to the @plant_proof Podcast on iTunes. Hope you enjoy! Simon, you’re a GEM and I love your podcast. You are So engaging, open and kind, I’m so glad to have connected with you.
user_17;user_17149.jpg;I just adore this little girl! Remember parents to not only show your children you love them, but show them you *like* them too- for who they are. That you love their personalities, and love to learn what excites them in life, that you love to be around them because they are awesome. That you jump at the chance to rest in their embrace and play the games they are excited to play. Being a parent we can get so busy and caught up in the to do list and work and cleaning and trying to have adult conversation amidst all that too and yeah- get burnt out too. It’s a lot! But these reminders are really helpful for me and get to the heart of what’s important to me cuz they are little for only so long. What’s your favorite thing about your child(ren)? Ps- this rattan mirror is by my fave People Before Profit company @31bits ! Check out my insta stories for my holiday ethical vegan gift guide we collaborated on!
user_17;user_17150.jpg;Thankful for meaningful, connected, motherhood friendships. And not even everyone is in this photo-you know who you are! It took a while for me to have a community of friendships where we live that fostered trust, non judgement, and deep love-and we are still growing and deepening that trust each day. I have a tendency to be suspicious and guarded when making new friends-likely stemming from past hurts and betrayals that deeply effected me. But I’m so thankful for these women helping me push myself to learn, grow and evolve. I think a lot of people might be in similar shoes to this, where past friendship hurts effect their present. Do you have any similar experiences? Having these women in my life is something I’m so truly thankful for. And they help me more as time goes on-continually learning from my mistakes with their encouragement and what feels like unconditional love. We are all different, excel in different ways to which we can encourage each other in, and many have different passions or viewpoints on things- its a beautiful thing. I look back at my thanksgiving from over 5 years ago when we first moved to Hawaii, eating our dinner with my little fam by ourselves and think, WOW look how it has evolved and grown! We had a massive and delicious vegan “Friendsgiving” sharing thanks for one another yesterday. (YT video coming soon on that!) I just want to encourage you. If you are lacking community and desire it, if you are feeling alone or hurt or guarded. I understand you. There is light ahead. I hope everyone reading this knows they are loved and cherished just as they are.  Photo by my friend @chelsea.jean

user_17;user_17152.jpg;HAPPY 7th BIRTHDAY MY DARLING ELVIS! I love you more than words can express. You were born into my arms and flipped my world upside down in the most intense but beautiful way. You made me a mother. You’re passionate, excited about Star Wars and Math, you love your buddies, you adore and nurture and take care of your siblings, you’re stubborn, sensitive and sweet all in one package. You want to wear this Star Wars shirt every day. I see glimpses of myself as a kid in you - right down to having a dress that I wanted to wear every day at your age too. But you’re so uniquely, and wonderfully and individually YOU. I love you Elvis, I can’t even fathom my world without you. Today we celebrate your life. ❤️
user_17;user_17153.jpg;Their smiles are everything for me. ❤️ Hope you’re having a beautiful day folks, gonna spend it cuddling and playing with my littles all day - the laundry and cleaning can wait for another day. 🙌🏼
user_17;user_17154.jpg;Not everyone is gonna like you, or understand you. People might even tear you down, misrepresent you, lie about you, exaggerate and twist the truth. And people might come to their own conclusions about you through assumptions and hearsay. And you know what, THAT’S OK. Other people’s opinions of you are not a reflection of your value as a person. In fact it’s quite the opposite- negative opinions and statements made against you are much more about the person saying it and what they’re going through than the person they are speaking of. Think before you speak. Is it kind? is it true? is it necessary? is it uplifting? is it helpful?  One thing I love about my journey on social media is that it has given me a thicker skin. The negativity comes in by the thousands and it has only made me stronger. It’s empowering to not let other people’s opinions and assumptions about me run my life, run my emotions or dictate my happiness and present.  Sometimes it hits hard and I need to take a moment to reflect. But then I look at the bigger picture and it really doesn’t matter-unless it’s constructive, which isn’t often, but when it’s there it can be overwhelmingly humbling and help us grow further.  Don’t forget to keep shining your light and not let it be dimmed by others opinions of you. You will NEVER make everyone like you or agree with how you are doing things. Just isn’t gonna happen. Accept it, fully embrace it, and keep doing good work and efforts in making a difference in the world.  You are beautiful and whole and perfect just as you are. And if you find yourself often spending time criticizing and thinking negatively about others- reflect on that. What good is that doing for your life?

user_17;user_17156.jpg;I am so excited to share some BIG NEWS for our family! We bought a home with lots more space to grow food!  It’s been a little over a week now and I am feeling so many intense emotions of gratefulness and thankfulness. Every morning I wake up and think, wow, the possibilities, and how I want to grow young here with my family. If you’ve been following my journey for a while you probably know its been our long term goal and dream to get a space with enough land to grow lots of food-moving towards sustainability. We’ve been saving and working towards this goal for years and have had our eye out for a while- then this place popped up which was exactly what we were looking for and everything fell into place.  There’s already a few mature coconut trees, a mature avocado tree and lots of banana plants. We are gonna grow taro, lots of veggies and herbs, and plant plenty more fruit trees. Lychee, jackfruit, ulu, lilikoi, and maybe even a durian tree. It’s more rainy and wet on this part of the island so the possibilities are endless and we are so excited to get our hands in the dirt and work towards fruitfulness for our future. Stay tuned on my youtube channel (Ellen Fisher) for shares of our space coming soon! Love you guys and thank you for your support all these years!

user_17;user_17161.jpg;Celebrating mamas and babies dripping in flowers is how we roll in this tribe! Yesterday we showered our friend Amanda @alohasol808 with love, encouragement, hand-me-down treasures, and coffee body scrubs, as she prepares for her third baby’s arrival with a Blessingway. And it’s extra special that we do these events at the same local ocean spot that we have celebrated the last few mamas with babies to arrive- it’s becoming a sort of tradition and one day we will all sit on this same sandy beach as mama bears with children grown off doing their thing, with tears dripping down our cheeks, reflecting on how quickly it all goes by. So thankful for @chelsea.jean always capturing the most authentic moments for us to remember forever. I’m so incredibly grateful for the supportive friends we have on this little island.  And for those who are curious, a Blessingway (sometimes called a Mother Blessing) is different than a baby shower that normally has lots of physical presents for baby, in that a Blessingway is in celebration of the Mother-filled with encouraging words, rituals and relaxation time to help mother feel inspired, loved and prepared for a positive birth experience and passage into motherhood.
user_17;user_17162.jpg;Fruits and vegetables are beautiful and appealing to the human eye in their whole natural state. We are naturally drawn to vibrant colored plant foods whereas the process of killing, skinning and dismembering an animal is not appealing nor beautiful to us at all-it is unsightly. And not only are plant foods appealing to our eyes, they are appealing to the rest of our senses too. The experience of picking a brightly colored ripe organic orange or mango off a tree satisfies us in every way - they smell amazing, they taste sweet and delicious on their own, there are no screams that turn us off because no one is suffering at the hands of our hunger.  There’s a reason we take children on a field trip to go strawberry picking, not on a field trip to the slaughterhouse. Because nothing nice happens in a slaughterhouse.  When we see a sick or injured animal, our first instinct is to feel bad for her, or to be inclined to go and help him Where as an animal who truly thrives on meat salivates and preys on the weak and injured.  This alone tells us a lot about what our natural foods are as a human species. A lot of people say “we’ve been eating meat for thousands of years” as a justification to keep doing so. Yet, we as a species have also been murdering and raping for thousands of years- we don’t use that as a justification to keep doing so. Our evolution and growth of consciousness means something and we should be inclined to follow it. Something to think about. #veganforever Music by @singtoconley “Fluttering”
user_17;user_17163.jpg;Love brings life to the world and women to their knees. 🕊Oh how he loves her.
user_17;user_17164.jpg;I like to take pretty pictures but don’t forget my house is probably just as messy as yours, my kids have stains on their clothes and I have more laundry piles to do than you’d guess. And I definitely have my frazzled days since having three. Even though everyone prepared me with explanations how hard three children would be, it still hit pretty hard-like, wow. We are outnumbered here. So when Scout is crying because she’s tired and needs a nap and at the same time Elvis and sandy are in the middle of a heated sibling argument that needs delegation…where do I begin lol. I even have Andrew at home with me (because we work together from home) so the thought of Andrew being at the standard work place like he used to be when it was just me and Elvis-phew. Lets just say, shout out to all the parents out there who are doin’ it day in and day out by themselves either from being a single parent or their partner is at work all day. Im really grateful to get to do this with Andrew by my side. I vividly remember the first time Andrew went outside to mow the lawn since Scout was born. (We only had a weed wacker at the time so it took a couple of hours to mow the whole yard.) It was my first time watching all three kids by myself when Scout was a couple weeks old and I kept looking out the window, like “When is he gonna be finished and come inside and help me? The lawn can overgrow into a jungle out there, I could care less right now!” 😂  Instagram is one of those wonderful but weird places where illusion is the standard and it’s important to remind us of that to have perspective. Sometimes when the last child is laid down for bed I take a deep SIGHHH. Because..its ..a lot. But they are everything for me and between all the chaos is the wonderful and the deep connection and the unconditional love. I wouldn’t have it any other way. They are my everything.
user_17;user_17165.jpg;New YouTube Video is up! Click the link in my profile to get to the video. I really like this one, hope you enjoy it too. It’s a goodie 👌🏼Hint: it involves a certain Captain Underpants Super Pie.
user_17;user_17166.jpg;Have you ever seen the documentary Plastic Ocean on Netflix? The amount of toxic waste we produce as a species that doesn’t decompose & pollutes our🌍earth, our only home-and the animals’ home, is sad and shameful. We are the only species on the planet to destroy and pollute like this. The doc went through the ocean floors showing images upon images of plastic and non biodegradable trash lining coral, and tangling up sea life. It showed conservationists picking up plastic to take out of the ocean. And It urged viewers to consume less plastic to help preserve the ocean + the animals, which was really 👌🏼. Elvis and Sandy wanted to watch the documentary with me too. And at one point during the documentary, some fishermen were slicing open a fish they caught to show the plastic inside the fish’s body. Elvis turned his face away because he did not like the site of it, and then he said, “Mom, why are they trying to save the fish by taking the plastic out of the ocean, but then they are killing the fish to eat them?” Good question bud. Did you know that a recent survey prepared by scientists affiliated with Ocean Cleanup found that at least 46 percent of the plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is from discarded fishing nets? And for every one pound of fish caught, 5 pounds of unintended marine species (dolphins, turtles, octopus, etc) are caught and discarded as by kill. 90 million tons of fish are pulled from the oceans each year. From all these angles- from pulling fish *out* of the ocean, to plastic *filling* the ocean, to discarded fishing nets from the fishing industries, to marine life being tangled and swallowing our trash, to mass animal agriculture poop run-off polluting/creating “ocean dead zones”, we are being so destructive. Roughly 70% of the oxygen we breath is produced by the ocean. If the oceans die, we die. You’ve heard it before, cutting down on your single use plastic is a great first step. And purchasing less physical STUFF that creates non biodegradable waste in general is even better. And leaving the fish in the ocean is even better. Also check out the Doc @cowspiracy on Netflix if you’re inspired by this.

user_17;user_17168.jpg;I love this moment because I was casually singing a song to Scout in the morning and Elvis peaked out of nowhere to finish the song for me 👌🏼💯🙌🏼😍. “Children are great imitators so let’s give them something great to imitate.” I loveee that, such a good reminder.👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼Hope you’re having a great day guys, living intentionally and starting your day out positively.
user_17;user_17169.jpg;I love listening to books on Audible! As a mom of three it can be hard to squeeze in quality reading time, but listening to books on Audible makes multitasking a breeze. Sometimes I’ll listen to a book while folding laundry after the kids go to bed. Sometimes while making a snack. Right now I’m re-listening to Positive Parenting by Rebecca Eanes. I find this book so inspiring and filled with helpful reminders on how to be the best parent I can be to help my children grow to be the best that they can be. #sponsored #audible
user_17;user_17170.jpg;Happy birthday babe!!🎉Your day of birth is definitely one of the best days in my eyes! I can hardly believe the life we’ve created together, life is so much better with you in it. @andrewfisher44 you’re such an amazing father- always telling them incredible stories that keep their interest and excitement better than anything else could, lifting your children up on your shoulders, rocking your baby to sleep in your big safe arms, instilling honesty and love through your example, and you’re so playful with them-you’re modeling the way your wonderful dad was to you growing up and I’m so grateful for you by my side.  We’re all snuggled up in the house today with the hurricane warning, going a bit stir crazy but just celebrating daddy as a family through birthday cards, back massages and cuddles…Nothing crazy where we live at this point, just some gloom and a little rain💦, but there’s a fire🔥on the other side of the island and most the shops are closed down. The hurricane slowed way down so it’s just a waiting game and we’re slowing life down, soak up every moment celebrating daddy at home today. ❤️❤️❤️
user_17;user_17171.jpg;HOW JUICY ARE THESE PINEAPPLES!?🍍🍍🍍12 years being vegan and I’m never going back! By eating a whole foods plant based diet I healed my poor digestion, my skin/acne issues and I now have a healthy relationship with food-eating when I’m hungry and stopping when I’m full-not overthinking it and feeling abundance and love every time I eat. I’m so grateful to have found this amazing lifestyle that not only is kinder to the animals and a lighter footprint on the planet, but I also get to reap the rewards of great digestion and energy, clear skin, thick strong hair and mental clarity. I’ve had three wonderfully healthy vegan pregnancies. My husband runs about 25 miles a week and thrives just like me and our kids do. My children have been vegan since conception and were raised on my breastmilk to start then on to whole plant foods and are thriving happy healthy children. People often notice how healthy they are. And I know so many other healthy vegan families- I’ll share some of them in my IG tories today.  But you know, it’s not just diet that helps you feel your best. Health is all encompassing. How are your relationships? Your thoughts? Are they toxic or filled with love and gratitude? Getting sufficient sleep, proper hydration, time in nature and healthy doses of moderate sunshine all play a big role too. Your MIND/FEELINGS about yourself, others AND about the food you ingest is so much more powerful than you might think. So if you are on your health journey working through some stuff, consider these things along your path.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the world’s largest association of food and nutritional professionals, agrees that a well planned vegan diet is healthy and nutritionally adequate for all stages of life. And statistically the longest living civilizations in the world have the lowest consumption of animal products in their diet-the blue zone areas. The Okinawans, who hold the record for the most centurions ever lived, centered their diet around the amazing sweet potato and 96% of their diet was plant based-link to this data will be in my Ig Stories.(..continued in the comments).

user_17;user_17173.jpg;If you haven’t seen in my stories by now, we’re in C A L I F O R N I AAAA, visiting family and soaking up all the hugs and kisses from their Grandparents. We’re staying at Andrew’s parent’s house who still have all their toys from when Andrew was a kid and the kids are having a BALL playing with all their cousins every day until the sun goes down. Makes me so happy to see all the beautiful memories they make together every year when we visit. Pretty lucky for us all of Andrew’s family lives in the *same* neighborhood (yep. All of them. Mom & Dad, all his siblings and their partners and kids) so it’s really easy to see every one with one go. We’re kind of the black sheep of the family that decided to live in Hawaii instead, but they still love us anyway PHEW! 😅😬💯😍
user_17;user_17174.jpg;Keep close to nature’s heart.. and clear away once in a while. And climb a mountain, or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean. - John Muir. How amazing is this photo!? I can feel the pure joy in their faces. It’s one of my favorites of my friend @chelsea.jean with one of her 5 babes, Bennett. She recently came out with Lightroom desktop and mobile presets and you guys they are SO good! 5 stars for sure! 🙌🏼⭐️Check out my insta stories of some before and afters using @chelseajeanpresets . So easy to use and brightens up my photos like 🙌🏼🌈. So many people ask me how I edit my photos and I mostly edit in Lightroom. If I had to recommend one preset purchase to help you with the editing process, @chelseajeanpresets would be it 💯. And if you don’t use Lightroom on your computer, you can get the mobile pack to edit the photos you take on your phone, easy peasy. I’m so inspired by you chels, you are so talented and I’ll always root for you!
user_17;user_17175.jpg;If you know me at all, you know I’m all about that green smoothie life.🤙🏼This one has fresh Oj🍊, pineapple🍍, frozen organic mango, barley grass juice power and kale from our garden🌱. I love to start my day with a green smoothie - fueling my body with whole organic fresh fruits and vegetables leaves me feeling energized and with great digestion. What’s your favorite smoothie combo? 😍😍😍
user_17;user_17176.jpg;"I absolutely adore this photo. It’s purely me in so many moments of my life- mother, care-taker, nourisher; on the sand in the shade with my little ones. My friend @chelsea.jean snapped this of me nursing Sandy and Scout a few months ago when Scout was just an infant, and I always wanted to share it I but knew there would likely be criticism for such a photo and I didn’t feel like dealing with it. I know I share other breastfeeding photos nursing my smallest babe, but there’s something about nursing two babies of different ages that some people can’t deal or handle it. Likely because it’s just not seen or as common. But I dunno I just woke up this morning and felt over that and just wanted to share this piece of me because it means so much to me and I think it’s beautiful. I really think we gotta get over the whole female nipple thing. One time my friend @ivetteivens posted a photo of a mother breastfeeding and one of the mother’s nipples was showing in the photo, so to show the irony of how we as a society are ok with male nipples but not female nipples, she placed an image of a hairy male nipple over the female nipple in the photo as a censor and it was so flippin’ funny..Anyhoo for those who are curious, Sandy only breastfeeds about once a day at this point, normally after his nap and he’s slowly weaning off and barely asks for it other than that. To all the mothers out there, you are loved and worthy and wonderful no matter your situation or if you breastfed like this or not. It’s all good and this isn’t a statement to put anyone down, its just me showing a moment I love."
user_17;user_17177.jpg;My family in our element. Living is learning and I love watching my kids grow each day. ✨❤️ Photo was taken by @olivia.doan who’s a 16 year old homeschooler already pursuing her passion in photography, graduating a year early and taking college courses. So amazing and I love stories like these. 🙌🏼 Have any of you seen the TedTalk “Hackschooling makes me happy” by Logan Laplante? It’s super good and a total game changer in the way we can view education. Also the TedTalk “Does school kill creativity” by Sir Ken Robinson is so good [and funny!] which is the most viewed Ted talk in TedTalk history. Anyone have a favorite TedTalk they wanna share in the comments below? Would love to hear. Love you all have a beautiful Sunday!
user_17;user_17178.jpg;Stir Fry noodles with Creamy Secret Sauce! 😍😍😍 Andrew came up with this dish years back and it’s been a favorite ever since! I posted a YouTube video with the recipe a couple weeks ago if you wanna check it out-I’ll put the link in my stories! The recipe is also in our ebook “Epic vegan food” filled over 40 of our family’s favorite vegan recipes, all whole foods focuses and gluten free. Sharing the recipes that make us feel our best!💃🏼👌🏼👌🏼(you can get it at user_17.com or link in my profile.) ❤️❤️
user_17;user_17179.jpg;They are all so different! A friend once told me, “I never knew there was such a thing as three polars of opposite until I had my third child.” Does anyone else relate/have a similar experience? Scout is only 5 months old but I’m already seeing this might be their future too.
user_17;user_17180.jpg;Have any of you guys seen this video on Eckhart Tolle’s YouTube channel called “Can we trust our feelings and intuition?” It’s so good you guys. I’ve never read any of his books but I know a lot of people who love them. My friend @justine_mcknight sent me this video link a couple days ago and I just wanted to share it with you guys too because it was such a powerful video for me! It’s all about how we react to other people and how often it is out of fear or a misinterpretation of reality. Which is so easy for the mind to do-to misinterpret another person and make assumptions about them or why they said this or did that, etc. Or even when you get upset when someone makes assumptions about you, has negative opinions about you, says negative words about you, etc. When we do this, (react, overreact, get angry, try to justify) we make life complicated for ourselves and others. This is the normal conventional way to do things but it is the ego responding. And when we detach from this we simplify our lives. I’ve certainly found this to be true in so many life circumstances. When someone has a negative opinion of me or makes assumptions about me, it’s my choice to either take that personally, stress about it and let it take over OR let it go, listen, and be understanding. Often on both sides, if we sat in each others shoes and listened to each other’s stories and why we have the perceptions we do, I think we’d be a lot more understanding of each other. It’s easier said than done though thats for sure! It’s a practice. Let me know if you watch the video and what you think, I’m interested to hear your thoughts! :) No matter where you are in life, no matter your stage or journey or what you believe, you are loved and wonderfully made. just. as. you are. Your value is not defined by other people’s opinions of you or assumptions about you. So you can take a deep breath and let that go.
user_17;user_17181.jpg;To those of you who are vegan. I encourage you to be a voice for the voiceless. Don’t shy away from the fact that you do not buy products that support animal exploitation and animal suffering. Don’t be afraid to be different than the norm. Of course, ALWAYS be kind, loving, and compassionate. Educate and inspire. Don’t have hatred and don’t put down. Have compassion for those who don’t see it the way you do. You were once there too right?  I’m not saying to be in people’s faces or be pushy about it. Because most of the time that isn’t helpful nor kind. Im saying, be the example. Be filled with kindness. Speak in loving ways. And show that veganism means love. I get that some people like the term “plant based” better or even don’t use a label at all because of the negative connotations some people have with the word “vegan”. But this is personally why I DO like to call myself vegan. You have the power to change the way people view what veganism is. You have the power to shift the connotation some people have to a positive one. Someone’s ill conceived perception that veganism is some way to separate or define who’s better than who does not define YOU. That is NOT what veganism is. Veganism is a lifestyle that says the life of an animal matters more than my tastebuds, habit, convenience, and tradition. And Veganism is about LOVE and compassion for all beings-including humans who aren’t vegan. Labels do not have to separate you if you choose not to use it for that. LABELS RAISE AWARENESS. And if someone feels isolated from your simple kind statement that you are vegan, then that is their own feeling for them to take ownership of, and is not a reflection of you. You can’t make anyone feel anything. We choose how we feel on our own. If all the vegans out there stopped using the word “vegan” people could easily come on to our pages and think “oh, there’s a nice family that likes to eat a lot of fruit.” And that would be the end of it. But instead people can come on to my page and see the words “vegan family” and that says a lot. We show how we live and THRIVE on plants and that we don’t pay for animal exploitation. (Continued in the comments.👇🏼)
user_17;user_17182.jpg;My people. 🌈👶🏼👦🏼👦🏼👨🏻❤️ I never want to take for granted all that I have. Here’s to being more present with our family, more full conversations with our children giving them our undivided attention, more love with our partner, more empathy with our children and positive examples in their lives.

user_17;user_17185.jpg;It’s crazy how fast they grow huh. And lately I’ve been thinking about how weird it is that one day they’ll be out of the house (and taller than me 😱) and Andrew and I will most likely still have a whole lotta life left to live sans wiping butts, early morning wake-up calls with snuggles in bed and delegating our days around nap time. That’s tripping my brain💆🏼‍♀️out when I think about it..so for now I’m soaking up every minute of it holding them close. We took a ✌🏼two day staycation getaway on the other side of the island at the @travaasa hotel this week and ohh my goodness it was beautiful. It was such good family time. If you’re ever looking for a jungly oasis get-away in Hawaii, this is your spot. 👌🏼

user_17;user_17188.jpg;Living is learning.🙌🏼🌈Have any of you read the book How Children Learn by John Holt? That book revolutionized the way Andrew and I view parenting and education. I highly recommend it for anyone who has children or works with children. It’s definitely in my top 5 favorite books I’ve ever read in my life. If you know me at all, you know I love a good John Holt quote. A couple of my favorite things Holt said is this, - If I had to make a general rule for living and working with children it might be this: be wary of saying or doing anything to a child that you would not do to another adult, whose good opinion and affection you valued. And this, - We can best help children learn, not by deciding what we think they should learn and thinking of ingenious ways to teach it to them, but by making the world, as far as we can, accessible to them, paying serious attention to what they do, answering their questions -- if they have any -- and helping them explore the things they are most interested in.

user_17;user_17191.jpg;Are ya’ll following @jamesaspey and @carlytaylor269 ?! You should be cuz they are literally AMAZING. I can’t fully express my gratitude for these two humans and the positive impact they are making on the world. They’ve been visiting us for a week now and I’m crying just thinking about them leaving soon. My family loves them more than we can express and my heart feels whole being able to share my time with them, talking about all the deep things we are passionate about and doing activism together. There is something so seriously impactful being able to truly be YOURSELF around someone, who truly GETS YOU, who feels the things you do, who really cares about evolving and growing in all ways of life together.  James and Carly are vegan activists that travel around the world doing speeches for animal rights and educating the public on the cruelty of what is so often hidden from consumers. Last night we held a screening for the new documentary called Dominion. Over 100 people showed up to be educated and watch what animals suffer through in order to be used of food, clothing and entertainment. There are a lot of awful things happening in the world and so many of them feel out of our control because most of them are not happening as a direct result of how we live our life or with our purchases. But this one, THIS is something that is completely IN our control. This only happens if we pay for it to happen. If we support these industries that exploit animals and use their bodies for our own benefit, this keeps happening. If we shift our purchases to plant foods and purchase clothing made with sustainable plant materials (and fair trade work practices), this goes away and you DO have the power to lessen suffering in the world. We vote with our dollars every day the type of world we want to live in. We can easily still care and spend just as much effort on human suffering by being vegan. Nothing is taken away from your life by shifting your purchases from cows milk to coconut milk. From meat to sweet potatoes, from leather handbags to cotton canvas bags, from a visit to the animal circus to a musical or play. Check out @jamesaspey + @carlytaylor269 and be inspired.

user_17;user_17193.jpg;Mmm this NOURISHING and VIBRANT salad is so good! Here’s the recipe:  Dice one large sweet potato🍠into cubes and place on a baking tray with parchment paper. Sprinkle with garlic powder and black pepper and pop in the oven for about 30 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Meanwhile, prepare in a big salad bowl: Chopped lettuce greens Diced tomato🍅, avocado🥑, cucumber🥒 and onion. Tear in sea veggie dulse (you can find dulse in the seaweed department of health food shops or asian markets.) Stir together the ingredients for the Spicy Maple cashew Dressing: *4 tbsp of cashew vegan “sour cream” (see below for recipe) 1 tbsp Dijon Mustard 2 tbsp maple syrup 1/2 tsp chili flakes  Top the salad bowl with the baked sweet potato cubes and Spicy Maple Cashew Dressing. Stir together and devour the creaminess with total satisfaction. *To make the cashew “sour cream”, blend 1 cup whole cashews, 3 tsp lemon juice, 1/8 tsp sea salt and 1/2 cup of water in your high speed blender (like the Vitamix) until superrrr creamy and smooth. This sauce is so versatile. There will be lots of leftovers that you can use the extra as toppings on top of chili, loaded baked potatoes, as a dip for veggies, on more salads, on sandwiches, etc. Pour the extra into a container and save in the fridge to use throughout the week.
user_17;user_17194.jpg;"Dear Mamas, you don’t ever need to compare yourself to other mamas on a screen. Everyone is just doing their best and none of us have it all figured out. We all have those days; you know the ones. The ones with early wake up calls, spilled food, sibling arguments and bathroom breaks with little fingers peeping through your door. The ones where you don’t feel refreshed and haven’t had a shower that day, with constant snack making, toddler meltdowns, and maybe even a mommy meltdown.  Your child sure isn’t comparing you to anyone else. To them you are the BEST, their Mama, their hero. And at the end of the day when you wipe their tears from their chubby cheeks and swoop them up into your arms, they know they are loved and you’re their mama. You got this. Just be you. 👊🏼❤️"

user_17;user_17198.jpg;"One of the most under-appreciated roles today is that of the father. Andrew has such a strong bond with his children. The boys know they are loved by him and feel confident in themselves. That they are free to be who they are and are daily encouraged in growth from their dad. Scout will grow up knowing that her beauty shines from the inside, and that Dad sees all their insides as BEAUTIFUL. Neither of us are perfect parents; we all make mistakes and there is beauty in the imperfection. Apologizing to our children when we make mistakes models humility and is an example for them how to be when *they* make mistakes. To all the loving dads out there, you are cherished and we are grateful for you!"
